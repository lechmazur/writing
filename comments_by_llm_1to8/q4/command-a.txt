  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering her apprentice and exposing the rival guild—is signaled early and sustained. The investigation tightens once (ledger → frost → caches → grotto revelation), but the escalation is linear discovery rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The resolution is deferred to future action ("she would use..."), so agency at closure is a plan rather than a present forfeiture or renunciation. Coincidence does not resolve, but the kiln and ledger discoveries feel convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging the world before and after the Noise—is signaled early and sustained. Elara's escalation unfolds through layered attempts (tuning fork alone, heat-mapping emotions, collaborating with Kael to amplify the pattern), culminating in the dawn realization that deepens her understanding. The tightening is meaningful under the Accumulative lens: the pattern discovery narrows her path from seeking literal sound to learning silence's language. However, Kael's arrival with the solution feels somewhat externally provided rather than driven by Elara's own agency, and the cost—letting go of her musician identity's active reconstruction—is present but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: restore the lens and send the signal. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the lens is incomplete, narrowing his goal to a scavenger hunt. The fragments are found via summary montage ("he dove," "each discovery") rather than on-page choices that test commitment. No reversal or setback; success is linear. The final signal reaches a ship's radar, but no visible price is paid—no stamina cost, no social trade-off, no path foreclosed. Agency is present (Elias acts) but pressure does not escalate under the lens; the quest unfolds as intended from the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—building intergenerational support—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara steps into moonlight and word spreads. The gathering represents a deepening, yet no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the young girl and elder volunteer without friction. Agency exists in Mara's decision to reveal herself, but the escalation curve is gentle and the final cost is declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. Elara encounters no friction, wrong turn, or price: she follows sparks, finds the pendant, places it, and receives immediate reward. No live option is foreclosed, no tactic fails, no tradeoff shapes her path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should tighten through pattern break or deepening; here the sequence is additive without a turn that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking time's texture to restore fading memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's journey through the maze encounters no meaningful obstacle; the fragment warms, the hedges part, and she places it "without hesitation." The vortex grants her exactly what she wanted (restored photographs, vivid ancestral stories) with no visible price, missed opportunity, or path foreclosed. One tightening occurs when the maze's geometry warps, but it doesn't narrow options or force a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reach vault before wall collapses) is signaled early and tightens once via enemy arrival. The liberator uses carnival knowledge to dodge pursuers, but the wall's groaning and men's approach function as atmosphere rather than forcing visible trade-offs. The chains' abrupt disappearance at closure—no dramatized cost, no forfeited path—deflates the escalation and leaves agency unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake ("find the sound of trust breaking") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal tests her commitment. The forge scene substitutes emotional declaration for escalation—Elara places the absence, the forge hisses, the sound materializes—without resistance or trade-off. Coincidence (the forge's existence, the aurora's timing) enables resolution rather than complicates. No visible price narrows later options; the ending grants insight without foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (retrieving the jar) is signaled early but never tested. The flower-code "trap" is defused by rearrangement without risk or visible trade-off. Elara's arrival replaces conflict with exposition; she hands over the jar willingly. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a cost. The ending grants Lira success, purpose, and illumination with no forfeiture, reading as symmetric satisfaction rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. Elara encounters no reversal, external pressure, or internal conflict that narrows her options. The ice melting outside operates as backdrop metaphor rather than a live constraint. No cost is visible; she completes her work and walks away satisfied, with only abstract declaration of "weighty lightness."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaim identity, expose betrayal—is signaled early but remains abstract. The decrypt-notes beat offers one tightening (pattern emerges, key found), yet the cost is invisible: no failed attempt, no trade-off, no live option foreclosed. The seashell's increasing glow and the unlocked door provide spatial progression but not escalating pressure; Elara's phobias "recede" without on-page struggle. The mirror-room moment attempts a turn but resolves via voice-over epiphany rather than protagonist agency with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping endless night—is declared early but never tested by opposition, cost, or tightening. The oracle collects stories without friction, and the ritual proceeds unimpeded. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the star's dimming is simultaneous mood rather than a pressure that forces a trade-off. The ending defers agency ("work far from over") instead of forcing a choice or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding thought origins—is signaled early but never tested by a live choice with competing goods or unavoidable harms. The "looped timelines" mechanic offers montage rather than escalation; Unit-7 witnesses iterations without navigating friction or paying a price to continue. The musical climax ("felt a surge of understanding") is summary epiphany, not a tightening that narrows options. No reversal or deepening on the page forecloses a path; the ending grants clarity without visible cost, undermining pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (thaw mistrust with transparency) is signaled early. Elara's sketching of her own doodles is a micro-choice that narrows options slightly. However, escalation is minimal: Kian arrives, sees the objects, and immediately validates her gesture without resistance, complication, or a visible trade-off. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option or forces a cost; the resolution feels unopposed and frictionless under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (proving the garden knows him) is signaled early but never tested by a complication that forces trade-off or sacrifice. Polishing marbles across weeks is iterative activity without a tightening choice or reversal. The resolution ("understood the true meaning") is delivered through interiority summary rather than agency that forecloses a path. No coincidence resolves, but also no protagonist decision visibly alters options or cost. Band guardrail: entering 8.0+ typically requires foreclosing a live option; this piece loops without narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving the theory—is signaled early and drives the lever-pull decision. Pressure escalates when systems fail and the nexus destabilizes, forcing Elara to sprint to manual overrides. Yet the resolution undercuts earned escalation: her second lever adjustment "with precision" immediately stabilizes the nexus without visible trade-off or loss, and the data confirms success at no meaningful cost to her theory, her safety, or her standing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's code—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. Clara encounters no wrong turns, no cost for her immersion, no trade-off between her identity as musician and her role as medium. The melody is "oddly familiar" and "somehow knew," eliminating discovery friction. The single tightening (ghost appears, Clara hums, connection achieved) proceeds without reversal or price. Coincidence governs: the water stains form notes, the ghost responds on c
    cue, and the program dissolves only after its purpose is served.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The wanderer's dialogue ("Then it's not a truth at all… it's a shadow") delivers conceptual friction, yet Elara's response (closing her eyes, accepting swaying certainties) does not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off. The smudge action is a symbolic gesture rather than an agency-driven escalation; no live alternative is foreclosed with on-page cost. Pressure stays atmospheric and declarative rather than tightening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the father's truth—is signaled early but never tightened; Mara faces no credible opposition or cost until the final beat, where "screams turned to sighs" without visible sacrifice. The "shadows twisted into shapes that lunged" moment promises escalation but dissolves immediately when she presses on, offering no lived consequence or trade-off. Agency is reduced to a single unopposed action (turning the valve) that resolves all pressure at once.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the "fragile balance" and "crumbling peace"—is signaled early but never tightened into a live dilemma. Lira's decision to follow the map lacks opposition or trade-off; the journey is arduous in description but not in cost. The mirror visions are passive (things happen to her) and upon return nothing has visibly changed in her actions or the library's state except for the asserted internal shift. One potential turn (the swan unfolding into a map) is intriguing but does not narrow options or force a sacrifice; escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake, which the ending does not deliver.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara nurturing wonder in Finn—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Finn moves from fear to curiosity, yet this shift lacks a visible tightening or trade-off that forecloses a path. The eclipse provides situational pressure, but Elara's actions (humming, holding the curl) do not face meaningful resistance or cost. The resolution feels declarative rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure. One tightening moment (Finn's telescope "forgotten") exists, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reversing the displaced axis—is signaled early but never tested by a live complication or reversal. Elara finds diaries, deciphers scrolls, and executes the ritual in an unbroken success chain; no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The ritual's energy crackle is atmospheric, not a pressure point requiring agency. Closure declares restoration without showing what Elara gave up or what path she foreclosed; felt cost is absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unveiling mysteries, claiming "the life that had been waiting"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the accidental brush with the microdot specs produces a stated epiphany without visible resistance, tradeoff, or cost. Li Wei's plan to journey is uncontested; no antagonist, internal conflict, or resource constraint applies pressure. The piece remains in preparation mode throughout, summarizing future intent rather than dramatizing a present choice that forecloses a path or narrows options under the inferred accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake ("stop the possession") is signaled early but never tested with a trade-off or narrowed option. The priest's questions and palette-waving encounter no resistance; the possession's "hunger" is described but never forces a micro-choice or tactical shift. The final beat — "The possession recoiled, its form dissolving" — is passive outcome, not protagonist agency under pressure. No visible cost: the priest steps back "into the shadows" unchanged, no path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening or deepening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to become the conductor of unheard symphonies"—is declared but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the writer inscribes, whispers, and the harp responds without resistance or cost. Exhaustion is mentioned as a deadline but never pressures a single choice. No reversal, no agency-driven escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested by a live choice that narrows options. Elara moves from path to path without cost, sacrifice, or trade-off; each encounter with an alternate self is passively observed and then dismissed by the tablet's flicker. No reversal or tightening occurs; the resolution is a conceptual shift ("not something to conquer but something to embrace") that arrives without prior causality forcing the insight. The final moment lacks agency—Elara simply "lets the darkness and brightness merge" and smiles, with no visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara commits to the backward-song experiment. The reversal (colors brighten, emotions surface) deepens her condition but is summarized across "hours turned to days" rather than shown in a single pressurized beat. The tear and discarded needle at closure provide felt cost, but the escalation mechanism (how reversed songs physiologically alter her) remains abstract, weakening the causal link between her agency and the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (understand the cryptic message) is signaled early and drives Elias forward. Escalation occurs—courtyard to wasteland to compound to tower—but the pattern-intuition that lets him slip past guards is convenient rather than costly, and the masked figure's revelation is expository rather than a reversal Elias earns. The resolution ("ready to face the storm") is announced, not tested on the page. One meaningful tightening (discovering the active zone) is present, but no visible tradeoff or foreclosed option lands at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the texture of time—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The rope-and-pattern alignment and the mirror's three images offer a tightening moment, yet the "impossible choice" resolves through realization rather than a trade-off with on-page cost. Agency reads as attention and endurance, but the final act (coiling the rope, stepping outside) does not foreclose a live option or pay a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—filling the chronic hush with meaning—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page obstacle threatens Elara's intent; she plays, speaks, and succeeds without reversal or cost. The "chronic hush" shifts from oppressive to expectant by narrator assertion ("the silence that followed was different") rather than through a choice that forecloses a live option. Agency is observation and execution, not a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—crafting an emotion for Kael—is signaled early but never tested. Elara faces no reversal, dilemma, or trade-off; the petal dissolves on cue, the transformation completes without complication. Static electricity "crackles" in response to her concentration, but no external or internal pressure forces a difficult choice. One tightening or deepening is required at this length; none appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—initiate a meaningful friendship—is signaled early and tightens once (letters → in-person meeting). The tightening is present but carries no visible cost; Elara feels "cautious exuberance" yet risks nothing on the page (no refusal from Clara, no social or emotional price). The grandmother reveal at closure feels like a gift rather than a consequence of Elara's agency. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices for this length, but escalation lacks a felt trade-off or foreclosed path, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—grafting into community—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through the broadening search and orchard residents' gradual opening, but this is accumulative rather than a tightening that forecloses options. No on-page reversal forces Lira to trade one goal against another or pay a visible price; the resolution arrives through Echo's external pronouncement. Agency at closure is passive reception, not a decision or renunciation that narrows her path with cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the Heart of Cadence to restore her creative rhythm—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance. The gate opens when touched, the staircase guides her, the pool grants understanding without cost. The "giant's nap" deadline is declared but never creates urgency; Mara "knew she couldn't stay" yet departs without visible forfeit. No choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; coincidence (pendant proximity to gate lock) resolves the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss and her mentor's fate—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the mentor's warning, raising the cost of proceeding. However, that danger never materializes on the page; her "final breakthrough" arrives without visible trade-off or a choice that narrows options. The resolution is declared ("balance that could heal") rather than earned through a decision under pressure. Agency is present in her decoding work but does not foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to become visible"—is declared but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or trade-off. Discovery proceeds without setback: each step yields another fragment, the process is "slow, methodical" but unobstructed, and the tape reel "hums to life" without failure or cost. No reversal, deepening, or tightening choice narrows options; coincidence (finding exactly what is needed) drives all turns. The resolution ("they had uncovered a way to connect") is asserted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is Mara's resistance to releasing control, signaled early. The storm provides external pressure that mirrors internal conflict, and rearranging pots offers a visible action. However, escalation is thin: picking up the leaf and moving pots are low-cost gestures, and the final surrender happens abruptly without a narrowing of options or a trade-off that tests commitment. The "terrifying prospect" is declared but not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for artistic meaning—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map leads her to the cove and the old woman hands her the book, reweighting her role from solitary painter to "keeper of stories." However, the exchange is delivered by coincidence (the woman emerges from shadows, already waiting) rather than protagonist agency, and no visible trade-off or cost appears on the page—Elara gains the book without forfeiting anything. The escalation reads as externally granted mystical validation rather than pressure that narrows options through her own choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (seeking answers about her clairvoyant failure) is signaled early but never tested under pressure. No reversal or tightening occurs—the cave simply grants her understanding and purpose. The merger with the cave is coincidental (she touches a pearl) rather than earned through agency. Escalation reads as mystical intensification ("music swelled," "crystals began to glow brighter") without a choice that forecloses a path or imposes visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—compiling lost stories—is signaled early and Elara's pull toward the cliffs provides one meaningful tightening when she discovers the carved wood. The valve's hum and the woman's arrival complicate the mission, but the escalation is largely atmospheric: no live option is foreclosed, and Elara's final choice (raising the valve again) feels affirming rather than costly. The piece offers coherent pressure but lacks a trade-off or visible price that would charge the ending under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the phantom punch mystery—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. The arrows, gate opening, and fortress dissolution all happen to Elara; she observes and follows rather than choosing under constraint. The final hesitation ("Elara hesitated, her fingers brushing") sets up a decision, but punching the ticket carries no dramatized cost or visible trade-off—the fortress simply dissolves and she returns unchanged except by assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake—Elara's longing for connection—is signaled early but never tightened through a choice that forecloses a live option. She climbs the tower because she "felt drawn," the tile reveals visions, and her skepticism "began to fade" without on-page resistance or trade-off. No meaningful escalation occurs; the tile solves the problem it introduced. Coincidence (tile discovery, tower's amplification, whale synchrony) drives all turns, and no visible price is paid that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (breaking monotony through discovery) is signaled early and escalates through Elyr's experiment. The solar storm and fragment manipulation create coherent pressure, and the shatter moment narrows options. However, the final cost is abstract ("the void...had changed") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, but the price remains declarative, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a fair trade, escaping the con—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Clara holds the pot and refuses to return it, then confronts her father. However, the escalation is mild: her father's anger "melts" without resistance, and no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The cost (honesty as strength, ending the running) is conceptual but not dramatized through a trade-off or sacrifice in the final beat. Agency is present but the pressure deflates rather than tightens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—collecting a new invented history—is signaled early, and the hum intensifies ("stronger, more insistent"). Yet no reversal or tightening narrows options; the discovery arrives without obstacle or trade-off. Elara's agency is passive reception, not decision or renunciation with cost. The resolution ("gift from the forest") is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action, and no visible price alters tactics or the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake ("uncover erased histories") is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when the wanderer finds the archive container and realizes it's a repository, not random collection—but this discovery doesn't narrow options or force a trade-off; they pocket the letter and continue as before. The label "for the forgotten" reappears as thematic commentary ("a warning—a reminder of how easily lives could be poisoned by neglect") without altering tactics. No visible price paid; the wanderer's quest simply deepens in stated purpose. Under Accumulative lens, escalation requires a density shift or cadence break that reweights the stake—here the shift is told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Mara's options; she encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and pays no visible price. The cello's hum and the shell's glow feel like atmospheric decoration rather than pressure points. The ending reconfigures meaning conceptually but does not foreclose a path or test commitment; Mara walks away with "courage" she did not earn through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving Luminara's identity against gentrification) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or dilemma that Lira must navigate with visible cost. Vorin's opposition is declared, not dramatized in a beat that forces Lira to adapt tactics. The festival "rallying cry" is a summary payoff for a conflict the text never put on the page as a reversible choice. No on-page price is paid; the ending asserts success without foreclosing a path or showing what Lira sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: document the site before terraforming erases it. The chemical message raises urgency ("outlast the dawn"), but no live opposition forces a trade-off—mission control's beeping is ignored without consequence. Elara's choice to stay until dawn is stated, not tested; the cost (turning away with "heavy heart") is declared rather than dramatized through forfeited safety, stamina, or professional penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs (message discovery), but escalation under the Accumulative lens needed a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (restore the drone and the traveler's trust), but the repair proceeds without meaningful resistance or tightening. Elara's methodical disassembly and patching encounter no setbacks, misdiagnoses, or trade-offs; competence is unbroken. The anchor-lifting event runs in parallel but does not complicate or deepen the repair stakes. Under the Accumulative lens, one expects a cadence shift or density increase that reweights cost; here the ending asserts symbolic weight ("anchor of its own") without an on-page price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the river's origin—is signaled early and pursued on the page. However, escalation is flat: Elara walks, notices, kneels, and finds without genuine obstacle or reversal. The falcon, mist, and fissure guide her forward rather than forcing tradeoffs. The "faint vibration beneath" and "thinner ice" offer mild discovery beats but no pivot where agency forecloses an alternate path. Cost is claimed ("understanding") but not demonstrated; no visible price alters tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's balance—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows Elias's options; he walks daily and the town passively improves without opposition or cost. The ending bell is coincidental validation, not a consequence of protagonist agency under pressure. No visible price paid, no trade-off forced, no tactic altered by constraint. Escalation is replaced by iterative summary ("days turned into weeks") that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—survival via limited oxygen—is signaled early but then abandoned without dramatization; Maya's shift to "discovery" happens by assertion rather than through a tightening choice that forecloses survival. No meaningful reversal or escalation occurs: the vial passively delivers visions, the temple obligingly reveals passages, and the distress signal is dismissed off-page. Coincidence resolves the problem (walls shift, chambers appear) without protagonist agency or visible cost. The piece declares escalation ("time running short," "weight of time") but never dramatizes a moment where that pressure forces a trade-off or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the family name—is declared but remains abstract; the ticking clock ("before they find the bodies") never tightens on-page decisions. The journal reversal (father's guilt, the hush's cost) is told rather than tested, and Elias's climactic choice to reject silence arrives as summary epiphany without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Pressure does not escalate; coincidence (finding the journal) drives the turn, not protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—repaying the debt—is signaled early but never tightened through an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. The bead's awakening and the chorus of whispers complicate atmosphere without forcing a trade-off or visible cost. The protagonist's agency is passive: she kneels, clutches, stands, and steps forward, all without forfeiting a live alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, no meaningful deepening or cadence shift reweights cost; under Causal, no because/therefore linkage alters tactics. Escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"carve a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never tested by an on-page obstacle or live alternative. Elara's sleepwalking removes agency; her movements are guided rather than chosen under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; each paragraph restates the transformation ("desolate to gallery," "ruin to reverence") without a turn that narrows options. The ending reports completion without a visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (restore faith via excavation) is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. Elara's "purposeful wandering" replaces agency-driven escalation; the roots "guide" and she "stumbles upon" the hollow without a reversal or forced trade-off. No visible cost accompanies the discovery—no loss of time, tool, or alternate path foreclosed. The chamber opens easily once the sundial base is placed, resolving without friction or protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—decode messages before dawn—is signaled early but never truly tightens. Lyra faces no reversal or complication; the chalk marks yield coordinates, the mailbox holds the letter, and time pressure ("before dawn fully broke") evaporates without consequence. No visible price is paid, and the resolution (letter acquired, mission complete) lacks agency-driven cost. Escalation is promised but not delivered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—protect the flame and the gateway—is signaled clearly by midpoint. Lira's arrival introduces urgency, and the collaborative embroidery session implies rising action. Yet the escalation is told ("worked through the night") rather than dramatized in a pressure beat with visible cost; the conspiracy never tests Elara's commitment with a forced choice between competing goods. The resolution (chart complete, purpose claimed) lacks an on-page trade-off or foreclosed option. Coincidence (Lira's timely arrival with full intel) supplies the turn rather than protagonist agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—evoking unsent apologies—is signaled early but remains abstract. The single on-page tightening (finding her own letter) arrives late and feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven. The shard enables rather than constrains, and Elara's agency is passive (she follows the path the roots and shard create). No visible cost alters tactics: she carries the shard in, reads the letter, and leaves "whole" without losing or trading anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decrypting the child's notes to protect a memory and promise—is signaled early and tightens once (fragmented phrases → map → plea). However, no reversal or live obstacle complicates the work; the coral "pulses in rhythm" as encouragement rather than resistance. The ending reconfigures Elara's stance (determination, voice for the voiceless) but the cost is told ("lotus-hearted but no longer aching alone") rather than shown through a foreclosed option or tactical sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening is present but without visible price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (rediscovering lost joy) is clear. The piece offers a tightening when Lira finds the film and decides to use the network, but that choice arrives without opposition or trade-off. No reversal narrows her options; the fog "seemed to guide her" and the system activates smoothly. Cost is told ("her work complete") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—awakening the garden/restoring the mural—is signaled early and narrows once (the exchange offer). Escalation is visible: static mural → subtle stirring → figures emerge → Elara must choose a new method. Yet the climactic turn is externally guided ("Let the garden guide you") rather than arising from Elara's contradiction or prior failure, diluting protagonist agency. The cost of exchanging certainty is declared but not dramatized as a tangible forfeiture—no prior attachment to method or outcome is shown fracturing under pressure. One tightening is sufficient for this length, but the price remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (protect the Lexicon from infiltration) is signaled but never escalates through protagonist agency—Elias is told the coordinates exist, then told the crisis, then follows. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows his options; the "test" (loose panel) and the seed-decipherment occur off-stage or are handed to him. The final line ("against the encroaching darkness") declares stakes without showing a trade-off, foreclosed path, or visible price paid. Coincidence (Krane's appearance) advances plot without protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—to transform pain into verses—is declared but never tested by opposition or a competing cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet simply continues her work across summarized time until she decides she's done. The "shift" in the antepenultimate paragraph is asserted ("something shifted," "the shell seemed to hum") without causal grounding or a visible price that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early but never narrows options or imposes cost. No on-page reversal or choice alters Elara's path; she follows the melody to the Vessel and sings, and the museum responds with cooperative light. The cracked chime shatters, but this is described as fulfillment, not loss. Escalation is atmospheric (denser clouds, louder echoes) rather than pressure-driven; coincidence (the call, the Vessel's hum) drives all turns. No agency or trade-off is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust with Kael after losing the manuscript—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Elara moves from seeking the inkwell to making three promises to writing, but none of these steps narrow options or raise cost in a way that forces a trade-off. The resolution (Kael's appearance and reconciliation) is delivered by the inkwell's magic rather than earned through protagonist action that forecloses a path. No reversal or visible price paid on the page; the "fear" she admits to Kael arrives only in dialogue at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (harmonize villagers' fear with scholars' curiosity) is signaled early but never escalates through on-page reversal or tightening. Elias discovers the envelope's adhesive message and the chain's poem, yet neither revelation forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; he simply synthesizes a floodgate design that satisfies everyone. No visible cost: the scholars nod, the villagers sigh in relief, and Elias leaves with his achievement intact. The tension is declared ("palpable as the heat") but never dramatized in a choice that alters tactics or meaning. Coincidence may complicate, but here nothing complicates—the solution emerges smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options. The letter ("The songs are in the dust") arrives as an external gift rather than a reversal earned by Elara's prior action. The "following weeks" summarize escalation ("Slowly, the songs began to return") instead of dramatizing a tightening choice. No visible price is paid; the resolution blooms without forfeiture or trade-off, undercutting the cost clarity required for higher bands even under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the prism's shift and the memory surfacing, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The resolution (leaving the logbook) is renunciation, but the cost of what she forecloses by walking away is asserted rather than felt or seen in lost opportunity or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding "the rhythm of belonging"—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure tightens when fireflies multiply and the facility's alarms blare, narrowing Elara's time. However, the escalation is environmental (ocean pressure, structural failure) rather than driven by protagonist choice; she observes, dances, and exits as circumstances dictate. The final dance is framed as defiance ("one last attempt to captivate the moment") but doesn't foreclose a path—she was already leaving. Under the Accumulative lens, the intensification is present but agency at closure is thin, and the cost (leaving a fleeting connection) is atmospheric rather than a visible trade-off shaped by her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the missing memory—is signaled early and sustained. Lira's shift from focusing on "the memory itself" to "the emotion it evoked" provides a modest deepening, and the glass glows in response. Yet the stakes never tighten into a trade-off or visible price; when the path image vanishes, Lira smiles and accepts the loss as intentional rather than costly. The accumulative design gestures toward intensification but delivers thematic restatement instead of a pressure point that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake is never dramatized with on-page opposition or cost. Elias's stated goal is "to serenade monotony with whimsy," but no resistance, failure, trade-off, or tightening of options appears—the crowd gasps on cue, the act completes as planned, he walks away satisfied. The "climax" is a visual effect, not a reversal or deepening driven by his agency. No meaningful escalation occurs; the piece reads as a single static demonstration without pressure accumulation or a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—completing the verse before discovery—is signaled early. The sentinel's arrival provides a tightening, but the resolution (sentinel walks away) bypasses agency: Lira does not choose, act, or renounce; the external pressure simply evaporates. No visible cost or tactical alteration follows from her defiance. One meaningful pressure point (the uncorking and inking) narrows options, but the ending does not cash that pressure into consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to illuminate value in the mundane before change arrives—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows his options; the "shift" he senses is vague and never materializes as concrete pressure. His decision to share his insights at the end is unforced, with no visible cost or competing alternative. Coincidence does not intrude, but neither does agency produce a meaningful trade-off or escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's guilt and desire for transformation—is signaled early but remains static throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; reflection deepens his understanding but does not force a trade-off or foreclosure. The walk away carries no visible price; the text asserts he is "no longer walking it alone" without dramatizing what path was lost or what cost was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is signaled early but never narrows options or generates a live choice. The tide threatens to erase patterns, yet Elara "adjusts" without cost or escalation—no option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts. The ending declares success ("she had found what she sought") without an on-page reversal or tightening that changes knowledge or forecloses a path. No agency decision, renunciation, or endurance with visible cost is dramatized. Pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (discovering what walls dream about) is signaled early but remains abstract; no immediate cost or opposition tests it until the final chamber. The diaries provide a warning ("To listen is to lose oneself") that could deepen jeopardy, yet Echo reads them without consequence. The wall's yielding and the pedestal's acceptance of the film strip resolve the quest through revelation rather than a choice that forecloses options or exacts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (persuade mirrors to show possibilities) is clear and sustained. One reversal appears: mirrors resist, Elara sings louder, mirrors surrender. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing—she continues the same method (coded lullabies) without tactical shift or visible trade-off. The resolution feels granted rather than earned: "the mirrors surrendered" after she "sang louder" and "poured her own pulse into the melody," but no on-page action shows what she forfeits or how her choice forecloses a path. The cost (fainter heartbeat) is summarized post-resolution, not dramatized in the pressure moment. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece needed a decisive tightening or cadence shift that makes the price undeniable on the page; instead, the price is asserted after the fact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war through this negotiation—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens across three days of negotiation, and Elara's voice-breaking speech represents a tonal deepening. However, the actual escalation mechanism is vague ("grueling...talked, argued, pleaded") and the leaders' shift occurs in summary ("something shifted"). No visible trade-off or forfeited option appears; coincidence (the midsummer stars reaching zenith) supplies atmosphere rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (preserve extinct bird species) is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle or tightening choice; she follows the map, finds the spot, and completes her mission without opposition or visible trade-off. The thunder "holding its breath" and rain arriving immediately after she plants the egg read as atmospheric convenience rather than earned pressure or protagonist agency shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (unlock the sanctuary to awaken the city) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: the threads untangle smoothly without reversal or meaningful tightening. No live option is foreclosed; Elara never considers retreat or pays a visible price during the task. The ending gestures at consequence ("the city stirred"), but it occurs off-page and does not test her further. The phrase "she knew her role as a chaste courtesan would never be the same" tells consequence rather than showing cost. One modest pressure point exists—"a reckoning with the cost of defiance"—but it remains abstract and does not narrow her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—ethical storytelling boundaries—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The heated argument occurs off-stage; Elias's reversal from "provocation to manipulation" worry to "rebuild, not dismantle" happens in solitary reflection without encountering resistance, cost, or a tightening choice. No live opposition, no visible price paid, no option foreclosed. The puppet arrangement montage summarizes preparation without dramatizing the ethical calculus or showing what he renounces.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral signals—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. No reversal narrows options: Elara proceeds from building to humming to adding the monarch wing to descending without friction. The "interrupted cadence" she senses does not alter her tactics or force a trade-off. The monarchs' absence is told backdrop, not on-page pressure. Agency is present (she chooses to add the wing) but the choice does not foreclose a live alternative or carry visible cost beyond the conceptual claim that "temporary structures fade."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or complication narrows Elara's options; she begins weaving and succeeds without mis-step, coincidence, or trade-off. The "after forgiving yourself" threshold is mentioned but not dramatized as a price paid on the page. No on-page cost forecloses a path; the melody plays, hope rekindles, success is unearned by protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no forced trade-off: the storm adds urgency in assertion only, and the wafer seal's revelation arrives without Foresight risking, losing, or renouncing anything. The climax is a passively received epiphany ("they saw it") rather than a decision under pressure. Cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—is declared but never tested on the page. Kael encounters no opposition, sacrifice, or trade-off; the tile is found easily, deciphered off-stage, and the covenant achieved by declaration. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The resolution is delivered by summary ("realized," "felt," "understood") rather than protagonist agency under pressure, and no cost alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (convincing Kael) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elara's cellular-memory tactic works on first application without adaptation or resistance that forces a trade-off. Kael's defenses ("pulled away, his defenses rising") collapse within the same paragraph with no visible cost to either character. The final question ("How do I start?") is a micro turn, but it doesn't narrow options or impose a felt price; the sanctuary "holding its breath" substitutes atmosphere for dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—recreating the sextant to capture the dream—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Elara lights lanterns, breathes deeply, and the sextant "fused together" without resistance or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the stranger watches passively, applying no counter-pressure. The final threshold moment promises transformation but delivers it as spectacle ("the fog began to thin, revealing glimpses") rather than a trade-off or forfeiture that closes a path. Agency at closure is observation, not decision or renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mending the breach and reconnecting with Lyra—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes the breach was "a necessary shedding," reframing her failure, but this insight is told rather than forced by a choice that narrows options. Agency at closure is minimal: the ribbon is woven into the tree, the vow is "transformed," yet no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid on the page. Coincidence complicates (the compass points to the ribbon) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("pursue forbidden knowledge") is declared but never pressured by opposition, cost, or internal conflict. The middle realization and the woman's arrival add information without narrowing options or raising the price of pursuit. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; Elara moves from confusion to "strange clarity" to "surge of purpose" without visible sacrifice or trade-off. The escalation is emotional assertion rather than dramatized pressure that alters tactics or forecloses a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—find the library before time collapses—is declared but never tightens on-page. Elara encounters traps, yet "her resourcefulness allowed her to bypass each obstacle" without showing cost or narrowed options. The guardian's demand for renegotiation is resolved in summary ("offering a bargain") with no dramatized trade-off. Coincidence (the diary is exactly where she looks; the flower unlocks the door) drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the garden and recapturing what was lost—is signaled early and sustained. The story offers one meaningful turn when Elara realizes the garden is "a state of being" rather than just a place, prompting her to "embrace the unkindled solace within herself." Yet this realization arrives via Lyra's voice and internal epiphany, not through a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. The threshold crossing feels like permission granted rather than a dilemma resolved, weakening escalation under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (decipher the seal, unlock the door) is signaled early, but escalation is absent—each step (examine seal, trace rope, reconfigure braids) proceeds in straight-line success without reversal or narrowing options. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the door simply opens when the work is done. The ending grants discovery without visible cost: no stamina spent, no rival claim, no knowledge renounced. Pressure remains static rather than building, and the protagonist's agency is execution of a known solution rather than a choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restore balance by finding the bloom—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure tightens as Lira moves deeper and the air grows heavier, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The seed is dormant, yet Lira knows exactly what to do and succeeds without complication. The storm "faltered" and "dissipated" in response to her action, a resolution driven by her competence rather than agency under duress. No credible loss or omission alters her approach, and the final act lands without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the prism to prove pattern—is signaled early but pressure remains static across weeks of work until the ritual. The star-alignment discovery and memory-sacrifice decision offer two potential tightening points, yet neither narrows live options through protagonist agency; the text presents them as sequential steps rather than escalating tradeoffs. The ritual's cost (memory loss) is told rather than dramatically embodied, and coincidence (the "peculiar alignment") enables progress without earned struggle. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the prism simply succeeds once the ritual is performed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory by interpreting shadow distortions—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara's progression from obelisk to winged statue to fog wall constitutes movement through space but not escalation under pressure. The shadows "seemed longer than they should be" and the wingtip "extended far beyond its physical counterpart," but these observations prompt conjecture and note-taking rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. The visions wash over her; she does not wrestle with competing interpretations or risk anything to decode them. The final statement "The collective memory was safe, for now" declares success without showing a decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Lira faces no material constraint (tools appear, people gather on cue) and no internal friction; her plan succeeds without adaptation. The escalation is additive (spin fire, then build mosaic, then ignite again) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. Closure reconfigures the mood ("blooming fortress at dawn") but the price is told—"battle against hopelessness was far from over"—not shown as a visible trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs: the cicada obligingly "grew warm," the grotto "whispered encouragement," and Elara's breakthrough arrives without friction. The pause with Kael is mentioned but does not return to pressure a choice. Agency reads as passive reception rather than decision or renunciation; the protagonist observes and absorbs without forfeiting an option or paying a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (cicada shift) appears, but escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's escape from claustrophobia to experience true silence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The climb provides one tightening moment (doll slips), but escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; the inversion enables rather than forces a trade-off. The resolution lacks a visible price: Elara returns changed, but no foreclosed path or felt cost appears on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Mira seeking refuge from chaos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure deepens through the vial's responses and Elias's course corrections, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed; Mira's relief arrives without a visible trade-off or cost that alters her future tactics. The storm glass and Elias's method drive the escalation more than Mira's agency. One turn (the garden pause) deepens but does not narrow her choices with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—find the stairway to the unclaimed throne—is signaled early but never escalates. Each obstacle (ivy-covered murals, sealed archway, endless staircase) resolves via the ruby flake's glow or Lira's recall without meaningful trade-offs. The sunrise deadline is mentioned once and never tightens choices. The final chamber "test" is conceptual and declared rather than dramatized, with no visible cost foreclosing a path. Pressure remains flat from first beat to last.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—protect the sanctuary from encroaching darkness—is signaled early and escalates through sensory pressure ("tendrils of shadow," "suffocating grip"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes her usual methods won't work and must sacrifice a scar-link. However, the reversal itself is summarized rather than shown through a concrete on-page decision point, and the price (one broken link) feels stated rather than felt in the moment, preventing higher escalation credit under causal standards.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"translate pressure into diamonds"—is signaled by the cryptic text and pursued through the portal, but escalation is procedural rather than earned by protagonist agency: Elara follows instructions, adjusts the machine per future-self guidance, and the chamber fills with diamonds without a visible trade-off or narrowed option on the page. The "quantum promise" concept declares high stakes yet never manifests as a concrete dilemma forcing a choice between competing goods. No on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; the resolution arrives via external guidance (future-self messages) and convenient fit (the bolt completes the circuit), undercutting earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the family truth—is signaled early but never escalates through Eleanor's agency. She turns the gramophone crank and is passively transported; the shadowfigure hands her the answer with no test of commitment or trade-off. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the melody "guides her intuition" without friction. The final paragraph asserts she is "no longer just the dynasty ender" but offers no on-page action or visible price that demonstrates what path is now foreclosed or what she sacrificed to reach this stance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing possibility through allegiance—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as vines pulse, program vibrates, and patterns coalesce. However, escalation is textural rather than decision-driven; Alaric observes and receives rather than choosing between competing goods. The final image (stringless marionette, lighter air) reweights meaning but presents no on-page trade-off or visible price. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is present, but cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake emerges: Elara's quest to unfurl Liam's story and mend her own brokenness. The button discovery initiates a tightening (cross-referencing the folder), but escalation is limited to information-gathering without opposition or trade-offs. No reversal narrows options; the letter is "never sent" but that fact does not complicate Elara's choices on the page. Agency at closure is a decision to "draft a narrative," yet the cost is abstract—what does she forfeit or risk by committing to this project? The story tells us it's meaningful but does not dramatize a price.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the revised histories and reigniting resistance—is declared early but never tested by a genuine reversal or trade-off. The enforcers' approach is mentioned but Mara adapts without visible cost, retaining both the key and her freedom. The broadcast solves the problem without sacrifice; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by constraint. Escalation is absent under any lens; the lagoon's resistance is metaphorical ("seemed to resist"), and the archive sequence is a retrieval without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("hush a prophecy") is signaled early but never tested on the page; no reversal, tightening, or credible obstacle forces a trade-off. The saxophonist plays, the grotto responds sympathetically, the prophecy dissolves—a single linear escalation without agency-driven complication or cost. Coincidence (the grotto "lending him its strength") enables resolution rather than the protagonist's choices narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the final image restores tranquility without forfeiting a path or altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the message in falling leaves—is signaled early, but escalation occurs primarily through summary and off-page research rather than on-page pressure that narrows options. The moonstone discovery introduces a complication, but the subsequent "days in the archives" compresses the middle, and the whispered revelation ("the moonstone speck was a key") arrives as convenient exposition rather than earned through protagonist struggle. The final transformation is declared without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. One tightening moment exists (the speck glowing brighter during monument-building), but it does not force a trade-off or constrain later action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding what the compass rose unlocks—is signaled early and pursued across locations. However, each beat is resolved by the compass pointing the way rather than the tinkerer making a choice that forecloses an option. The descent into the cavern and retrieval of the map intensify the mystery but the stakes remain abstract ("the true treasure wasn't gold or jewels—it was understanding"). The resolution is delivered as epiphany rather than a trade-off with visible cost: he leaves the map behind, but the text does not establish what prior want or capability he sacrifices to do so.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the coin—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; the furnace sequence is a passive vision rather than a choice-driven tightening. The ending claims balance and understanding without demonstrating what Elara risked or forfeited. Coincidence (the coin glows, visions appear) complicates without agency, and resolution is granted by insight rather than earned by protagonist decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (gather spectral confession). The figure's appearance and confession provide one beat of escalation, but Elara faces no counter-pressure, tactical trade-off, or failed attempt. Playing the harp produces immediate success without complication. The cost—"luminous ache"—is asserted in reflection, not demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the mathematics of mercy"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara walks, remembers, touches a leaf, and experiences clarity without obstacle or trade-off. The forest "whispers" and light "intensifies," but these changes are atmospheric, not tactical—they do not force a decision or foreclose a path. Dropping the mask strap in the final beat lacks causal pressure because no prior scene dramatized her attachment or the cost of keeping it.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring forgotten histories—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. Lila's journey proceeds linearly: fragment → painting → map → tower → success, with no reversals, obstacles that adapt, or visible prices paid. The fragment "pulses with light" to solve problems rather than requiring agency. The ending claims gratitude from "overlooked histories" but no on-page escalation forces a trade-off or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's drive to discover what ceilings hide—is signaled early and propels each beat. The ghost girl's gesture upward tightens focus, and the ceiling tile's release narrows options (commit to the void or retreat). Inserting the barrel is the peak action, and the outcome (clock runs, ghosts released, façade heals) lands on the page. Yet Marcus faces no opposition or tradeoff; each discovery leads smoothly to the next without a reversal that costs him stamina, safety, or another goal. The "weightless burden" language asserts relief without showing what he gave up. Escalation reads as procedural—complication through discovery rather than rising pressure that forces a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the bottled whisper and the frost patterns—is signaled early but never tightens with meaningful cost. Elara's descent into the clouds and discovery proceed without opposition or trade-offs; the clouds "cradle" her and guide her. The rupture in the frost pattern promises destabilization but delivers only revelation without price. The ending declares her readiness without a visible forfeiture, and no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—prove temporal plasticity and redeem her reputation—is signaled early. The night infiltration provides one beat of escalation, but the shard's success arrives without cost or complication: no Empiricist discovery mid-ritual, no vision that challenges her theory, no trade-off between vindication and something she must sacrifice. The final "triumph was bittersweet" is asserted rather than earned through a visible forfeiture on the page. Agency reads passive; the shard does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaim the stolen light—is signaled by the stranger's opening request. No on-page reversal or tightening choice occurs; Elias proceeds from curiosity to journey to success without failed attempt or visible trade-off. The coincidental vanishing of the stranger removes interpersonal pressure. Restoration is achieved by turning a key and unwinding thread with no dramatized cost that narrows later options. Agency reads as competence without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is signaled early, but it remains abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off on the page. The descent is frictionless: no physical barrier, no rival claim, no cost in stamina or safety that forces Elara to weigh options. The compass-drop is a symbolic release, not an escalation-driven choice with visible stakes. One deepening occurs (tunnel opens to lagoon, psychometry visions intensify), but pressure does not tighten options or forclose a path with felt consequence. The resolution is arrival, not agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the slide's secrets—is signaled early but escalation is absent. Mara encounters no meaningful obstacle: the archway opens on cue, the chamber appears, and the slides merge without resistance. Her GPS failure is mentioned but never complicates navigation. The "fear and exhilaration" is told, not tested. No choice narrows her options or costs her something tangible; the transformation from sculptor to "keeper" occurs through revelation rather than agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream's essence—is signaled early and remains coherent. The cathedral visit constitutes one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, and the question "why do flowers bloom at night?" threads through. Yet no on-page reversal or visible trade-off narrows options; Elara's journey proceeds without complication or loss. The final image asserts resolution ("a truth") without dramatizing the cost or a path foreclosed, leaving escalation functional but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the diary's buried truth—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One tightening occurs when doubt creeps in ("just as doubt began to creep into her mind") before the figure emerges, but this micro-turn resolves immediately without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off; the figure's appearance is coincidental validation rather than earned escalation driven by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid: Elara's ritual succeeds on first attempt, the figure grants acknowledgment, and her hope increases. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweight cost; instead, the lagoon encounter flatly affirms her quest without complication or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (revive the ghost town) is clear, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Elara faces no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and suffers no visible cost; the bottle glows, the cove transforms, she walks away fulfilled. Coincidence does not complicate; the magical transformation simply grants her wish without agency or sacrifice. The resolution is passive and convenient, with no escalation or deepening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the garden remembers—is signaled after the prophecy plays, roughly one-third in. Pressure accumulates through the decipherment sequence, but no reversal or tightening narrows live options; Elara encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and pays no visible price. The silent foghorn and prophecy complicate the situation, but the resolution (speaking in the dead language) solves the mystery without dramatized cost. Agency is present (she chooses to walk the garden, decipher symbols, speak the words) but the final act feels ritualistic rather than renunciatory or conflicted. One meaningful deepening occurs (realizing her work continues the Orchadrians'), yet it doesn't foreclose a path or impose felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the vortex inheritance to restore the world—is signaled early but remains abstract. Elara faces no meaningful reversal or tightening choice that narrows options: the acorn cap fits, the archway opens, the vortex welcomes her. Coincidence (the egg's gift, the vortex's "warmth") facilitates rather than complicates. The resolution is a discovery handed to her ("she understood the method") without on-page cost or trade-off. Pressure is declared but not escalated through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding wind whispers and tracking the zero hour threshold—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric cues (air pressure shift, rope twitch, hum crescendo) and culminates in the decision to pull the rope "with purpose," which triggers the bell and rain. However, this escalation is more textural than causal: no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off is dramatized. The cost is implied (crossing a threshold) but not shown as a felt price that alters tactics. The resolution is atmospheric rather than a hard choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Lira's spiritual search—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tightens. No reversal or trade-off appears; she follows coordinates, receives insight, and returns to work "forever changed" without visible cost. The lantern's dimming is narrated as fulfillment, not loss. Coincidence drives the plot (devices activate "on their own"), and the protagonist's agency is limited to observation and acceptance rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the tangled covenant—is signaled in paragraph three but remains abstract until the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when ghosts become visible and Elias realizes he must "give voice to what had been left unsaid," but this realization arrives late and is told rather than tested through on-page friction. The ritual itself is performed without resistance, setback, or competing pressure; Elias gathers fragments and sings, the ghosts dissolve, and the oasis awakens. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option accompanies the restoration; the escalation is assertion rather than earned narrowing of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (restore time's flow) is signaled early, but escalation is mechanical: discovering the fragment → garage sale messages → Thaddeus explains → device activation. No on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; Thaddeus's arrival hands her the solution. The device activation carries no visible cost—no stamina burn, no social price, no forfeited path—only a declared "sense of belonging." Under a causal lens, the lack of trade-off or foreclosure at the peak beat is a critical gap.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but remains conceptual and never faces a concrete on-page test that forces a trade-off. The wanderer's loss is declared rather than dramatized, and the poet's solution (offering the feather) costs her nothing visible. The kite repair functions as a symbolic collaboration but lacks oppositional pressure or a moment where success is uncertain; the glowing words at the end feel like ambient reward rather than earned closure driven by protagonist agency. One micro-tightening occurs (the frayed string, the decision to repair), but escalation is flat and the final image reweights meaning without legible cost or a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—foster interspecies respect before death—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias wraps branches, discovers carvings, and documents changes in a frictionless sequence. The orchard "approves," the pillars "glow," and the wind "whispers gratitude"—convenience plotting that rewards without cost. Agency is absent: the transformation succeeds without sacrifice, adaptation, or a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The ending offers no visible price paid; Elias smiles and dies, satisfied, with no dramatized consequence of his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early but remains conceptual throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: Elara ascends without obstacle, the pilgrim acknowledges but does not complicate, and the chamber revelation unfolds as epiphany rather than earned conflict. The amber placement feels like ritual completion, not agency under pressure. Cost is told ("her skepticism softened") rather than demonstrated through a visible price or foreclosed path, failing the escalation test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake ("let a garden reclaim a battlefield") is declared early but never tested or tightened by opposition, resource scarcity, or competing priorities. The coachman encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and experiences no reversal; he completes his planting and departs satisfied. There is no escalation under any lens: no causal narrowing of options, no accumulative density shift, no situational pressure forcing stance crystallization. The "spark of something new—possibility" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized cost or forfeited paths.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the leaf's riddle—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. Elias's factory visit unfolds without obstacle: he finds the cylinder, fits it to the phonograph, and receives revelations without cost or complication. The "riddle" dissolves into passive reception ("letting the sounds wash over him") rather than active problem-solving, and the leaf's transformation occurs off-page during the playback. No live option is foreclosed; the ending asserts connection without demonstrating what Elias risked or renounced to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—navigating temporal chaos to find "true north"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; sketching proceeds without complication or cost. The shutdown and temporal anomalies remain abstract backdrop rather than forces that compel trade-offs. Agency is observation and declaration, not decision or renunciation with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—amending the sky—is established early and the spire's trials promise escalation. The chess game is framed as the final challenge, but "hours turned to moments" compresses the match into a summary, and Kael's "daring swap of his queen for the spire's rook" is told in a single sentence without showing the narrowing of options. The revelation that the lid is a key rather than a tool offers a conceptual turn, but agency is passive: he lifts it and "a surge of energy coursed through him." No visible price is paid; the sky simply restores itself.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is Elara's desire to "unbind" from past roles. Pressure remains static: the walk with Kael functions as a single illustration rather than a tightening turn. No reversal or escalation narrows options; the resolution ("you just needed to see them in yourself") is delivered as epiphany without prior friction or a visible price. The chessboard-without-pawns metaphor reappears but does not force a tradeoff or crystallize a choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("understand the shape of home") is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; Elara finds the stone, focuses on a feather memory, and the stone obligingly glows and rearranges the space. The climactic moment—"she finally understood"—lacks a visible price or foreclosed path. The story substitutes poetic declaration ("harmony of her fragmented self") for a dramatized escalation under pressure, and coincidence (finding the stone exactly when needed) drives the resolution rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma; Elara encounters no opposition, and the labyrinth offers answers rather than complications. The tapestry-decoding sequence ("hours passed, or perhaps only minutes") lacks a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The climactic thread-pull is handed to her without prior cost or trade-off; coincidence (the labyrinth parts, the thread glows) resolves rather than complicates, violating lens coherence under any mode.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can forgiveness be reshaped into something Lira can carry? The pressure accumulates as mist thickens and echoes multiply, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when shadows of wronged/wronging appear, raising the question's cost. However, Lira's agency is passive—she recites, the spire responds, shadows dissolve—without a tightening choice that narrows options. The ritual deadline is mentioned twice but never pressures tactics on the page. The final "path forward" appears as a gift from the spire rather than a cost Lira visibly pays through renunciation or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging fragmented memories—is signaled early. One modest tightening occurs when the workshop shudders and threatens collapse mid-ritual, forcing Elara to narrate quickly. However, her agency reads as observation and alignment rather than a choice that forecloses a live option; the charm clicks into place without visible trade-off (no stamina spent, no tool sacrificed, no social credit lost). The cost remains abstract ("between breaths held underwater" is metaphor, not lived constraint) and the resolution (peace, hope) is declared rather than earned through protagonist decision with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—keeping the hidden promise through timeless art—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a meaningful trade-off. The detour is coincidental, the oasis welcoming, and the painting completed without struggle beyond "weight of her promise." No reversal or tightening narrows options; she decides to paint, paints, and displays without friction. The final "rejoining" is declared mood shift, not a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—is signaled but never pressured by a live opposing force or internal contradiction. The heat wave breaking and the woman's appearance are situational gifts rather than escalations driven by Elias's agency. One tightening occurs when Elias follows the woman, but this is a compliance move without visible cost or narrowed options. The woman's delivery of the thesis ("Whispers travel farther than shouts") reads as validation rather than a trade-off, and Elias returns to the lighthouse with doubts simply removed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance through the beacon—is signaled early, but escalation remains largely external and convenient rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The hydraulics failure is backstory, the cryptic calls are received passively, the device "began to emit" its tone without a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The arrival of the first traveler provides a micro-turn but lacks friction; subsequent arrivals are summarized ("word spread, and soon others arrived") without on-page tightening or trade-off. No meaningful price is paid to achieve the beacon's success.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (escape involuntary truthfulness) is clear and the situation escalates from discovery to village consultation to dawn ritual. However, the escalation is more sequential than tightening—each step follows neatly without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options with visible cost. The ritual resolution arrives through external instruction (Mara's textbook) rather than protagonist choice under pressure, diluting agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture—is signaled early but never tested by a dilemma or cost. Elias's investigation yields clues without reversal or narrowing of options; discovering the journal solves rather than complicates. The final acceptance of stewardship arrives without visible trade-off (time, social cost, foregone clarity), making escalation feel more like accumulation than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (finding purpose/direction) is signaled but never tested by a choice with visible cost. The revelation that Elias is a guardian arrives via exposition from the cloaked figure rather than through his own struggle or renunciation. The ants, crack, and archway appear as serial conveniences—no earned reversals where solutions generate new complications. The climactic portal moment resets to his shop with no on-page consequence; "over the following days" summary replaces dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams—is signaled early. The climb itself offers physical escalation, but pressure remains external (advisors' warnings, shadows shifting) rather than driven by protagonist agency. The revelation that her kingdom's actions tipped the balance arrives via the starlight figure's exposition; no on-page choice narrows her options or imposes a trade-off, and the vow to restore balance lacks a visible price that would alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("capture the density of presence") is signaled early but remains conceptually abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the shell glows, Kael touches it, and success is declared without visible cost or tactical shift. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency—Elara hums, the nexus "bends," and the transformation is asserted rather than earned. The final "revalue" language does not dramatize what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—integrating fragmented selves—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara unrolls the scroll and drifts into the dream expanse, but the escalation is contemplative rather than driven by agency under duress. The past selves' dialogue ("You just forgot how to see it") resolves the conflict externally rather than through Elara's difficult choice. No visible price is paid; the "weight lifting" is told rather than shown as a forfeited path or tactical shift. One meaningful deepening occurs but lacks the felt cost required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara's search for solace and meaning through the screw—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with competing costs. The piece deepens understanding (she "understood" the screw's meaning) without a reversal or decision that forecloses an option. Mira's arrival and the screw handoff are beats of exposition and validation, not escalation. No visible price paid; Elara's final stance is presented as arrival rather than renunciation or trade-off, keeping the piece in mid-band under Accumulative pressure logic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara seeks to shed past fears and transform scars into stories. The quill's crystallization provides one tightening moment when her stress surfaces, and her response (closing eyes, grounding via superstition) offers a micro turn. However, the escalation is internal and reflective; no external opposition or meaningful trade-off forecloses a live option with visible cost. The resolution—quill smoothing, peace settling—reads as emotional summary rather than a choice under pressure that narrows tactics or alters stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (reconnect with grandmother, deliver apology) is signaled early but remains internal and told. The single tightening—holding the bottle, channeling currents, feeling forgiveness—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No reversal tests commitment; coincidence (grandmother's presence arriving via the bottle's "currents") resolves the apology without protagonist cost. The orchard's impending loss adds atmospheric weight but does not alter Elara's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, sacrifice, or a narrowing of options. The witness encounters no friction, temptation, or cost; each chamber offers revelation without resistance. The final "task complete" moment asserts unity achieved but dramatizes no reversal, tightening, or price paid. Escalation is absent; the journey proceeds as accumulation without pressure or agency-driven turns.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and held throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Elias stays in the station, counts backwards, and retrieves the key without competing options or visible cost. The parchment resolves the quest without a tightening choice or trade-off; the mist clearing and his sense of peace declare resolution rather than dramatizing a forfeiture or stance crystallization. One meaningful beat (inserting the key) narrows options slightly, but the final image does not reweight cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding her father's legacy) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she walks the aisles, reads scrawls, and arrives at an insight without visible cost or a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. The story gestures toward internal escalation (her "resolve") but the pressure never crystallizes into a decision with stakes legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Eli's isolation versus connection, signaled early through "cultivated estrangement." The calls escalate in frequency and urgency, and Eli's choice to play the disc is a tightening moment. The dawn phone call is a meaningful turn. However, the escalation is largely passive—callers arrive, Eli responds—and the cost of breaking his silence is implied rather than visibly paid on the page. The bridge metaphor does conceptual work but doesn't narrow tactical options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve the locket's story—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens with cost. Elara faces no opposition, resource limit, or competing desire; the stranger's delivery and Mara's revelation are gifts, not obstacles. No reversal or trade-off narrows options. The resolution (documenting the story) is a continuation of her role, not an earned transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is declared early but never tested through on-page reversals or trade-offs. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara explores, touches the clock, and receives a vision that solves her problem. The resolution arrives via external magic rather than her agency. Coincidence (the glowing clock, alternate selves) resolves rather than complicates, violating the situational lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to map emotional depths—is declared but never pressured by a meaningful tightening or reversal. Elara follows the trail of notes without obstacle, arrives at the stillpoint, and receives the insight without cost. No live option is foreclosed; no trade-off dramatized. The "pause" of constellations and the melody's insistence suggest escalation in atmosphere only, not in agency or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—deciphering and stabilizing the anomaly—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara steps into the void and realizes she must "unbend the timeline," narrowing options from interpretation to intervention. However, the escalation is passive: the pen warms, her hand moves "of its own accord," and the resolution arrives without a forced trade-off or visible price that forecloses another path. Coincidence (the pen's automatic response) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to translate silence into music, to give voice to the voiceless"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout; no concrete on-page test materializes to challenge this goal. Pressure is asserted ("the air around her seemed to vibrate") rather than dramatized through resistance or cost, and the camera's unexplained click resolves nothing because no problem was causally established. The protagonist's agency is passive observation and gesture without opposition; coincidence (the camera clicks on its own) substitutes for earned escalation, and the ending's "triumph" carries no visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows options; the arsonist moves from clue to clue without obstruction or visible cost. The scroll appears as a prize, not the result of agency-driven escalation. Coincidence (finding each next clue) advances the plot without forcing a stance or forfeiting a path.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling entangled memories—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The lagoon's ripples and hum constitute a single tightening, yet Elara's agency is passive: she sits, the water responds, insight arrives. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the "shared dream" concept shifts from curse to gift without on-page friction. The final choice to find others carries no visible cost—no stamina, time, social credit, or relationship is spent or altered in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—is signaled at the Mira encounter but never dramatized as a forced choice between subtlety and force. The wall of containers and matching lock arrive abruptly with no prior complication; coincidence (Mira holding the lock) solves rather than tests. One reversal occurs (blocked passage → key opens it), but agency is thin: Eli hesitates, inserts key, passage opens. No visible cost narrows later options; the storm subsides without price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—releasing a "half-spoken secret"—is signaled but never tested on the page. The stranger arrives burdened, sits, speaks (off-stage summary: "words tumbling out"), and leaves lighter without a visible trade-off or narrowed option. The guardian's task is complete by fiat; coincidence (the mirror's reflection, the completed pattern) delivers relief rather than protagonist agency driving a turn with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—launching a "humble rebellion"—is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, opposition, or tightening choice appears; Elias gathers supporters and executes his plan without friction. The final paragraph asserts success without showing cost, trade-off, or altered options. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates; the story moves in a straight line from intention to declared fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (finding freedom in her true nature) is signaled early but remains abstract. The one on-page reversal—barrier dissolves when she lets go—is un-priced: no competing option is visibly sacrificed, no tactic altered by the scrimshaw's loss. The island's appearance and the whale's call complicate rather than escalate; Elara's agency at closure is passive (she closes her eyes and releases the object) rather than a forced choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to honor grief within the mandate—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page decision with cost. The whittling is a private ritual, not a choice that forecloses an alternative or risks discovery. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the story loops through summary (brother's fade, mandate's grip) without a beat where Elara's action changes her situation or knowledge. The ending asserts resolve without demonstrating the price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet steps in, touches the quartz, recites, and succeeds without friction or trade-off. The "courage to dismantle the walls" is told rather than dramatized through a forced choice with visible cost. Escalation and agency are absent, capping the score well below mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake ("finding beauty in imperfection") is signaled but remains abstract; no concrete trade-off or tightening narrows Elias's options. The concertina's spontaneous awakening and plants' cooperative swaying feel like external gifts rather than pressure driven by Elias's agency. No meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: the courtyard spirits simply validate Elias's thesis without cost. The glassblower's closing affirmation ("You've captured it") resolves the stake through external approval rather than through a choice or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection through lost sounds—is signaled early but remains conceptual and never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's "work" consists of passive listening; no reversal, tightening, or live cost appears on the page. The sounds she hears (child's laughter, factory hum) are summarized reflections, not obstacles that force tactical shifts. The ending declares enlightenment and purpose without showing what she sacrificed, refused, or lost to reach it. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it stays rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with her husband's legacy—is signaled early. Pressure remains stable rather than escalating: Elara traces, gazes, folds origami in a "predictable rhythm" until the curtains respond to her "quiet yearning." The climax is externally granted (light, glow, warmth) rather than driven by protagonist agency; she does not choose to press the stencil against her skin after weighing cost, she acts "without thinking." No live option is foreclosed on the page; the pendant crafting in the final beat adds a new task without dramatizing what she gave up to commit.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping the cryptocurrency conspiracy to understand cultural unraveling—is signaled early and remains coherent. Mira's arrival provides one meaningful turn (from solitary curiosity to collaborative investigation), and the discovery that the crash was "engineered" raises the conceptual stakes. However, the escalation operates primarily through information accumulation rather than choices that narrow options or impose visible costs. The resolution ("patterns can be reversed") asserts transformation without showing what tactical price or foreclosed path this understanding demands.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—unlocking forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but remains abstract. The one tightening (recognizing the erased pattern) doesn't foreclose a live option or force a trade-off; it simply delivers the solution. The pagoda responds without resistance, and Elara's "journey was far from over" ending defers cost rather than paying it on the page. No visible price alters tactics, and the protagonist's agency is observation rather than a decision with consequence. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with cost; here the reweighting feels declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the shadow's meaning—is signaled early, and the move from archival research to forgotten corner tightens focus. However, escalation is assertion-driven: Elara "decided to delve deeper" and the shadow simply materializes without resistance or complication. The climax—pressing stone to vial—meets no obstacle and incurs no visible price; the sculpture appears, the library "sighs in relief," and Elara walks away with "triumph and sorrow" that feel declared rather than earned. No foreclosed option or tactical cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing trust and identity after betrayal—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page pressure. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara moves from hurt to peace in a single reflective arc without encountering friction, cost, or a moment where competing goods force a trade-off. The con and its revelation occur entirely off-page, leaving no live conflict to escalate. Agency is limited to symbolic gestures (arranging tools, placing the tail tip) that do not foreclose paths with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking closure and understanding her scars—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. The plants' telepathic guidance removes agency; Elara follows instructions rather than making pressured decisions. The tunnel sequence offers potential reversals (fragments of past, weeping, scars) but they are summarized visions rather than dramatized obstacles that force trade-offs. The climax (placing the hourglass beside its twin) is a cooperative puzzle-solve without sacrifice, and the resolution ("scars began to fade") is bestowed rather than earned through protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure accumulates via the layered goodbye letters, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a genuine trade-off. The projector's death is passive (it happens to her), and her choice to take the film strip feels preordained rather than hard-won. The escalation is textural (letters merge, words overlap) without a visible cost that narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity to restore the village—is declared early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Lira begins ready to listen, listens, and ends ready to continue. "Rest" as the central action imposes no trade-off, and no live option is foreclosed. The astrolabe's trembling and the archway's glow hint at escalation but deliver no on-page cost or narrowed tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (cultivate the sparks) is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or cost. Mara's journey proceeds via external magic (charm activates, clock restarts, archive responds) with no meaningful tightening or choice that narrows her options. The archive "dying" might have created pressure, but it resolves instantly when she raises the clock—a solution requiring no sacrifice or trade-off. The ending amplifies success (new jars, new futures) rather than presenting any foreclosed path or earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering insight—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live choice tests commitment. Eamon explores, encounters wonders, and places the gear without facing opposition or trade-offs. The translocations "became more purposeful" by summary rather than escalating pressure. The machine's activation grants clarity without earned renunciation or visible cost, making coincidence resolve rather than complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding "where unused courage waits"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Mara's options. The ferryman's reappearance and the air-punch resolution feel coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency, and the cost (freedom from the leash) is declared in the final paragraph without a visible forfeiture or trade-off. Escalation reads as atmospheric accumulation rather than pressure that forces a stance crystallization with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early but remains abstract until the pedestal surge. The discovery escalates pressure in one meaningful tightening (sealed door → hidden chamber → knowledge transfer), yet the resolution depends on off-stage revelation rather than protagonist decision under duress. Coincidence (the stain) initiates discovery without prior groundwork. The final act—playing the piano—reweights the silence, but the cost (breaking stillness, accepting keeper role) is told rather than tested through on-page friction or trade-off. Agency at closure is present but underdeveloped; the choice to play feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (unmask pretender) is signaled early but pressure never tightens through on-page reversals—messages are left, pretender responds off-page, then appears. No live option is foreclosed; the pretender's arrival and confession are convenience plot. The ending's symbolic gesture (pellet pressed into hand) substitutes for escalation. Escalation by lens (Causal) requires narrowing options; here, the climax summarizes capitulation without showing the tactical cost or bind.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the torn page's significance—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Elara notices, wonders, researches, concludes. No reversal tightens options; no on-page choice narrows a path. The alarm and data upload create a beat but don't escalate pressure. Closure is a realized explanation, not a decision with cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights stakes is required; the story offers thematic summary instead.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira seeks meaning amid the rebellion's lull. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone circle's hum triggers the vision, reweighting her understanding of the rebellion as "a single, shimmering thread" rather than scattered defeat. Agency is attention and realization rather than decision with trade-off; the story tells us her "awkward confidence transform[s] into something steadier" without showing a path foreclosed or a price paid. The escalation is textural (hum intensifies, vision expands) but lacks visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unsealing the embryo to restore culture—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page obstacle. The guard hesitates and steps aside without forcing a trade-off; the unsealing succeeds on first attempt with no cost or complication. The "roar" and "fountain of light" are atmospheric escalation, not pressure escalation. Mara's agency is declarative ("she knew what she had to do") rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the irreplaceable photograph—is signaled early and escalates to physical danger at the cliff edge, creating one meaningful tightening. The slip ("her foot slipped on a loose stone") raises cost and narrows options in the moment. However, the resolution relies on convenience (she catches herself and the photograph "just as it began to fall") without a visible tradeoff, and the transition to the sketching epiphany feels like a separate emotional arc rather than a causally linked consequence of the retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara seeks to reclaim creativity by confronting despair. Pressure accumulates through card-gathering and reinterpretation, a single meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no live option is foreclosed and no visible trade-off occurs—she simply decides darkness is "where the light begins" and ascends with steady hands. The ache shifts from burden to guide through assertion, not dramatized cost. One tightening is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time bends in crisis and her brother's death—is signaled early and remains coherent. The drone-led search creates forward motion, but the tent discovery and the woman's explanation arrive without resistance; Elara faces no trade-off or tactical narrowing. The vision of her brother is granted rather than fought for, and the final acceptance lacks a visible price that alters later options. One meaningful tightening is present (following the drone to the tent), but escalation remains atmospheric rather than agency-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (exposing suppressed truths versus protecting the archives) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elara moves from reading the letter to accessing the network to copying the data in a straight line with no meaningful reversals or tightening. The claim that "the system would alert the authorities" creates urgency in name only; no concrete countdown or tactical adjustment follows. The story tells us she has "only moments" but her frantic work succeeds without visible trade-off or loss. The resolution depends on her action, but convenience (an unguarded terminal, instant decryption, no interruption) undercuts the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve the sanctuary against external threat. Kael's warning introduces pressure, and Elara's acceptance of the blade is a choice point. Yet the escalation is told rather than shown—"days passed," fortification occurs off-stage, no second reversal tightens options. The blade's acceptance lacks visible cost (she hedges with "I won't use it unless I have to"), and the ending does not test whether she must. One turn with muted cost caps the score in the 5s.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("catch the echo") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Kael performs no reversal, makes no trade-off, and faces no escalating pressure—he walks, the constellations freeze, the goddess appears. The resolution is entirely coincidental: the rail spike's function is revealed by assertion, not by Kael's agency or a visible price paid on the page. No meaningful escalation or cost legibility under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—exposing the surveillance scheme—is clear, but escalation is thin. Eleanor uncovers evidence, arranges a meeting, receives evasive answers, then acts alone; no on-page reversal tightens her options or forces a trade-off. The director's evasion is told rather than dramatized, and the final recalibration of the telescope is a gesture without visible cost: we don't see what Eleanor risks or forfeits by defying the director or what immediate consequence follows her symbolic act.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—hushing dissonance/finding redemption—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page consequence. No option is foreclosed until the final paragraph's declaration; the firmware's shift and the amber's peace are outcomes asserted rather than choices dramatized. The letter-writing sequence summarizes catharsis without showing a trade-off or cost. One tightening (discovery of letters) raises knowledge but does not narrow options or force a visible price. Agency is present (she writes letters) but the decision lacks embodied friction or visible sacrifice, keeping this in mid-5s under Accumulative lens standards.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning during the unlearning—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tile-flake insertion triggers a vision rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. No on-page reversal or tightening: the mandala responds, a story unfolds passively, and Elara "honors" the silence without a visible trade-off. Agency is observation, not decision or renunciation with felt consequence. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is required but not delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—renaming their world through the mosaic to make mercy essential—is signaled early. However, the work proceeds without on-page opposition, resource constraint, or a moment where a live option is foreclosed. Elara rearranges tiles "guided by the chipped patterns" with no friction, error, or tactical adjustment. The piece asserts transformation ("the plaza began to take on a new life") but no cost or trade-off is dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the final paragraph only declares hope without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("lure possibility from the brink of despair") is signaled early but never tested: the woman accepts the coin without resistance, experiences an immediate mood shift via its magical colors, and departs "steady" with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening occurs; the garden "responds" and "shifts" through atmospheric adjectives rather than Mara's agency or cost. Coincidence (the coin's autonomous color-morphing) resolves the problem it did not help create. The "fractured timeline beginning to mend" is told as summary in the final paragraphs rather than demonstrated through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to illuminate… what had gone wrong"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's night-long assembly proceeds without friction, failed attempts, or a visible price that forecloses an alternative approach. The "jagged edges where thoughts had been severed" and "glowing threads that could be rewoven" are observed in the finished painting, not dramatized as a choice under pressure. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution is aesthetic achievement without agency-driven escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (mapping lingering emotions) is signaled early. The fossil discovery and floating episodes provide complications, and the hidden chamber offers a tightening moment. However, Elara's agency at closure is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses options; the fossil leads, she follows. No visible trade-off or cost narrows her tactics. The resolution declares meaning without on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the canyon echo to recover lost wisdom—is declared but never tested with genuine pressure or trade-offs. Elara's process involves sorting buttons and pressing one against the jar; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. The echo simply swells when the bone button is applied, voices share their wisdom, and the task completes without cost, error, or renunciation. Escalation is absent; the conflict resolves through a single convenient gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.1)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page with legible consequence. "Fixing what's broken" and "unused courage" remain metaphors; no concrete goal (find a person, retrieve an object, escape a threat) is established and narrowed. The letter arrives without cost or complication, delivering wisdom rather than forcing a choice. Escalation is absent—walking, opening the pillbox, reading the letter occur in sequence without reversal or visible price. Agency is minimal; the protagonist is moved by atmospheric drift rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the palimpsest promise—is signaled early but never tested through protagonist agency. The figure's arrival is coincidental, and the "answer" is delivered via dialogue rather than earned through a reversal or difficult choice. The ticking gutters suggest urgency but stop on their own without forcing a trade-off. No visible cost attaches to the revelation; the coachman simply accepts the wisdom and continues, unchanged in any legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding why the oasis resists change) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-off. Elara's study progresses smoothly from discovery to epiphany to community teaching without a single reversal, failed attempt, or cost that alters tactics. The glass glows brighter when her "intentions are pure" and dims when "thoughts turn harsh," yet no scene dramatizes her managing this constraint under pressure or sacrificing a want. The resolution—villagers rebuild hives—occurs in summary after the protagonist's arc has already softened into teaching mode, with no on-page price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is Elara's desire to "reflect light into dark corners," signaled early and reprised at closure. One tightening: curiosity pulls her to the dock, and the tooth exchange crystallizes connection. However, the lockmaster's arrival is pure coincidence—she makes no prior choice that summons him or risks anything to descend. The final bestowal of the tooth and his acceptance feel like mutual gift rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. Pressure remains atmospheric ("quivering hush") rather than escalating through protagonist agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled but remains abstract throughout. Elena's journey into the library and interaction with the orb face no opposition or reversal; the door opens, the visions arrive, the power integrates without friction. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the resolution is delivered by the orb's visions rather than protagonist agency. The hum and the stone circle function as quest markers, not obstacles that test commitment or force a price. No visible cost is legible at closure—Elena smiles, empowered, with no path foreclosed or resource spent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the thread that connects all things"—is declared but never tested with a live choice or visible cost. Elara's walk and placement of the spiral encounter no opposition, internal friction, or escalating pressure. The installation activates without her needing to solve, sacrifice, or renounce anything; the "gasps" of the crowd are external color, not reversal. No meaningful tightening narrows her options, and the resolution (peace, renewal) rewards her without forfeiting a path or paying a price scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decode and neutralize the signal—is signaled early and tightens when Hank pressures her. Elara's activation of the counter-frequency is a clear on-page reversal. Yet the escalation plateaus: the signal distorts, protests erupt off-stage, and Elara resumes work without visible cost or trade-off. Coincidence (protests outside) complicates but does not force a harder choice, and the ending asserts readiness rather than foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the vital key to unlock spatial mutiny—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chamber walls contract, forcing Elara to "embrace the mutiny." However, the escalation resolves through internal shift ("she embraced the mutiny, allowing it to reshape her fears") without agency-driven action or visible cost; the walls expand and the path opens as a result of her acceptance rather than a concrete choice that forecloses an option. The turn lacks the trade-off or price needed to enter the 8.0+ band under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—solving Lila's disappearance and awakening empathy—is signaled early but never tightened by an on-page choice that forecloses an option. The figure's appearance could generate escalation but Elara simply watches it vanish; no trade-off or cost follows. The portrait act is contemplative mood rather than a move under pressure. Closure declares "a way to see beyond the void" without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering her great-uncle's truth and honoring his legacy) is signaled early, but escalation is shallow: Elara deciphers journals, finds a stanza, presses the nail into the floor, and speaks a name without meaningful resistance or trade-off. The ritual succeeds immediately with no on-page cost—her choice between "restore or protect" is elided, and the resolution (clear sky, intact journals, fulfilled nail) offers no visible price. Pressure does not tighten; each step advances through discovery rather than narrowing options or forcing sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hitchhiker's secret—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page reversal or trade-off. Bridge-Song's journey is a straight upward hike: each clue yields the next without misreading, dead end, or cost. The clearing's discovery and the sanctuary's revelation arrive as data downloads rather than pressure points that foreclose options. No visible price (stamina, resource, alternate path abandoned) shapes the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to discover why some paths circle back"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The journal provides exposition, and the scavenger encounter offers a potential complication, yet Elias dissuades him with calm rhetoric in a single beat without visible trade-off. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the money is examined, the cars walked through, and understanding arrives as summary rather than earned pressure. The final walk-away lacks a foreclosed path or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—decode the inscriptions—is signaled early but never escalates through a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Hours pass, a pattern "suddenly" emerges, and Elara gains understanding without visible cost, risk, or sacrifice. The "plea for unity" revelation does not foreclose a path or test her commitment. No reversal, no price paid, no agency-driven turn that alters tactics or consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—saving the lake and confronting her buried truth—is signaled early and escalates when the vortex's energy surges as she approaches the center. Eira's choice to unbend (yielding rather than resisting) is a meaningful agency point that forecloses her defensive posture with on-page cost: her defenses crumble and she must voice her failure. The seed's transformation from key to mirror adds a reversal that deepens the pressure. The resolution is earned by her surrender and confession, though the external stakes (the lake healing) and internal stakes (self-confrontation) could be more tightly braided.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (mend the eclipsed covenant) is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma or reversal. Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle—the maze reveals its secrets willingly, the hidden path appears on cue, and the pedestal accepts the clipping without complication. Agency is limited to forward motion; there is no on-page moment where she must choose between competing goods or forfeit a live option. The covenant's restoration is announced rather than earned through protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's bound purpose vs. the debt coming due—is signaled early and tightens when the roots form the card's pattern. The shadow-figure encounter narrows options (pay or stay), but the resolution hinges on reframing rather than a choice that forecloses a live tactical path with visible cost in the moment. The trammel (earth resisting) provides one meaningful tightening, yet escalation feels more conceptual than pressure-driven; the figure's reveal and Elara's decision land as thematic statement rather than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering purpose after loss—is signaled early and sustained. However, the escalation is minimal: Elias reflects, then walks to the window in a moment of mild realization, then steps outside. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the "shift" is interior and summarized rather than tested by external pressure. The cost is told ("ready to wrest his story back") rather than shown through forfeiture or confrontation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the deepening is conceptual but lacks felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of transition—is clear early. Pressure accumulates through the seed's glow and visions, but escalation is gentle and declarative rather than tightening options. The planting is the sole on-page decision; thereafter events unfold without further agency or trade-off. No live cost is dramatized: "haunted ambitions...felt lighter" tells resolution without showing what path was foreclosed or what Eliara sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (stabilizing identities) is clear, and one reversal occurs: the runes rearrange, forcing Elara to decipher new patterns. Pressure accumulates through description but the protagonist's agency is passive observation plus one ritual act (dissolving the orb). The resolution—identities stabilize in new forms—arrives without visible cost or trade-off on the page; the claim "not a failure but a transformation" is thematic framing, not dramatized consequence. No tactic is foreclosed, no price paid that we can point to in a specific sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—assessing bunker safety versus pursuing deeper meaning—is signaled early but never tested through a forced trade-off. The pearl's pull removes agency: Elara follows rather than choosing between duty and curiosity with visible cost. The crown revelation supplies answers without complication or reversal. The ending declares she is "no longer alone" and has "steady resolve" without showing what she lost or risked to gain it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (path to self-forgiveness) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. There is no meaningful on-page tightening: Elara enters seeking something, finds graffiti echoes of her own thinking, meets a man who affirms her quest, then decides to begin. No live option is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced by external pressure. The medication backstory is recounted as explanation, not demonstrated as a choice under stress. The final act—tracing her own map—feels like commencement rather than a turn that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("find the one that held her answer") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. The protagonist encounters no live obstacle, makes no choice that narrows options, and pays no visible price; the library grants access, the quill writes, and she departs with the parchment intact. The watch's backward ticking and the library's trembling are atmospheric rather than escalatory. No meaningful pressure point forces a trade-off or alters tactics, and the resolution is bestowed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—protect the violin from the Dominion—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Elara faces no on-page reversal or tightening choice; the Dominion scouts prowl below but never test her resolve or force a trade-off. Her decision to play the violin is not dramatized as a consequence of narrowing options; instead, she "knew what she had to do" after a single stain interpretation. The resolution (vines awaken, scouts freeze) is convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid that alters later tactics; the violin becomes lifeless, but Elara remains unchanged and the Dominion threat simply vanishes. Under the selected lens (likely Causal or Hybrid), one meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is required; this piece provides none.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing a spark before oblivion—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. The emerald chip's activation is Elara's only decisive action, yet it succeeds without cost or complication. The traveler's lesson provides a conceptual reversal (stillness over sparks) but arrives through exposition rather than pressure-driven choice. No visible price is paid; Elara's final acceptance of stillness feels declarative rather than earned by prior escalation under the inferred Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or forced trade-off. Elara's actions (climb, retrieve, follow map, touch shell, step into lake) are passive compliance with magical prompts; no decision narrows options or incurs visible cost. The lake visions are a free gift that solves the problem they did not help create. No escalation or tightening occurs; pressure remains flat from opening yearning to closing satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—helping Mara shed doubt—is declared but never tested on the page; Mara does not appear, and no reversal or tightening choice narrows Elias's options. The sequence (arrive, listen, write, leave) lacks escalation: the wind chimes deliver their message without complication, and the letter is completed without friction, cost, or trade-off. Elias's "fulfillment" is asserted rather than earned by a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—revealing withheld truth—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The trance sequence deepens via ripple-vision images, yet no on-page reversal forecloses a live option: Elara decides to speak, but the story summarizes her words rather than dramatizing resistance or immediate consequence. No secondary character appears to test her resolve, so escalation operates solely in reflection. Under the Hybrid lens, the accumulative pressure (years of silence, colleagues' frustration glimpsed in visions) builds texture, but the final act lacks a visible price—colleagues are absent, and the "unburdened" state replaces cost with relief.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (understand the arrowhead's purpose) is signaled early but never opposed or tested. Kael waits, the flock appears on cue, patterns coalesce cleanly into meaning—no reversal, no tightening of options, no visible cost in the decision to "turn attention inward." The final stance ("journey far from over") dissolves urgency rather than crystalizing it. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pressure remains static until the interpretive payoff, which arrives without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—prove manual magic's worth by retrieving the keystone—is signaled early but never tested by on-page trade-offs or narrowing options. The closing-wall trap introduces a beat of pressure, yet the harness resolves it without cost: Eli activates it, steps into mist, and emerges at the pedestal with no forfeited resource, injury, or moral calculus. The keystone's touch grants "clarity and purpose" but no visible price is paid—no renunciation, no lost alternative, no stamina or social credit spent. Escalation stalls after one reversal (trap triggers) with no deepening or second tightening before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or competing need. Elias follows the light, descends, finds the book, and speaks his vow without encountering friction, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The key tag's pull is irresistible, foreclosing agency. No reversal or tightening alters tactics; the sequence reads as outline fulfillment rather than escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the backwards prophecy to enable universal rebirth—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; the distillation succeeds on first attempt, each coin advances the prophecy smoothly, and no competing option is foreclosed. The declared universe-scale stakes remain abstract; on-page conflict centers on operating a machine that works perfectly. Agency is absent: Lira does not choose between paths or pay a price; she executes a procedure that delivers success without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sea monsters crystallize and Elara names them, reweighting her grief into purposeful action. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes a trade-off; the observatory and atlas cooperate without cost, and the resolution feels granted rather than fought for. Agency is present but unopposed, and the tightening is more textural accumulation than causal pressure under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the bell's crack remains visible but it chimes faintly, then waves rise, confirming partial success. However, the escalation is linear (study → clean → alloy → rejoin → strike → hang → result) without a reversal or forced trade-off; Eliard's agency is procedural rather than choosing between competing goods under pressure. The final wave is a response to his work, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Accumulative pressure builds through the dripping-rates method, satisfying the lens, but the absence of a dramatized trade-off or visible price at the peak keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's memory—is signaled early but never encounters meaningful resistance or cost. Elias walks, gathers, curates, and succeeds without sacrifice, trade-off, or a moment that narrows options. The townspeople's immediate acceptance and the return of laughter read as frictionless resolution, with no agency-driven tightening or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (finding the crystal to harmonize logic and intuition) is signaled early but never tested or deepened. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each beat (starlings, crystal, flame, altar) opens smoothly without resistance. The placement of the crystal is unopposed—no cost, no trade-off, no decision between competing goods. The flame "envelops" without consuming, a convenience that deflates tension rather than escalating it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("decipher the chaos and restore order") is declared early but never tested on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced by rising cost. The "pattern finally revealed itself" bypasses protagonist agency; the seeker "pauses," "recalls," then succeeds without a visible trade-off or price. "Radio static had finally cleared" implies off-page progress. The arbor approving and celebrating deflates rather than escalates pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice that forecloses an option. The "duel" lacks agency: Kael strikes, the brain mirrors, emotions arrive "in waves" without Kael resisting or adapting tactics. The final act—shattering the jar—is declared decisive but not earned by prior pressure or reversal; no visible trade-off or loss accompanies the merge. Escalation is assertion-based rather than dramatized tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout; Eli's leaf blower symphony proceeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost that narrows options. No live trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page: exhaustion is mentioned but does not alter tactics, and the laughter's return is convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency under the inferred lens. The task is declared "impossible," yet the resolution arrives without on-page struggle that changes knowledge or stakes. Escalation is asserted through intensifiers ("louder, more insistent," "crescendo") rather than dramatized through choice or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (return home vs. protect the library) is declared but never tested through on-page choice with visible trade-off. The keeper's exposition delivers the conflict rather than Elara discovering it through action. The climax—"I will wait"—defers rather than decides, and no cost is enacted: the pendant dims, but Elara loses no resource, foregoes no concrete opportunity, and the garden remains unchanged. One situational pressure moment (the keeper's arrival) complicates but does not escalate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—interrupting a stifling destiny by achieving transformation—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara presses the crozier into the ground and the nexus responds, but the escalation is smooth rather than testing a forfeited option; the sapling's emergence is presented as success without a visible tradeoff (no failed attempt, no resource spent that alters later tactics). Agency is present (she chooses to chant, to use the crozier), yet the resolution feels enabled by the world's cooperation rather than by a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the beginning in every ending"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara's only reversal is recognizing the shard is "a mirror, not a tool," but this realization costs nothing and is rewarded immediately with brighter glow. No live option is foreclosed; the melody falters and returns as convenience. Agency is observation ("she realized") rather than renunciation or trade-off. The resolution is passive: she "let the shard's power flow freely" without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—restore the ferry and save passengers—is declared early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Mara's journey into the rift and "channeling energy" to reset time bypasses on-page escalation; no reversal or tightening choice alters her tactics. The transient's warning is deflected in one line with no cost. "Hours—or perhaps minutes" compresses what should be a crucible into summary, and the passengers' frozen state resolves through mechanics rather than Mara's agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection—is signaled early but remains conceptual. Pressure accumulates through imagery (gallery eruptions, shadow-man's warning) yet the escalation is atmospheric rather than decision-forcing. The shadow-man's question ("what if it unravels you?") offers a potential tightening, but Elara's choice to resume weaving lacks visible tradeoff; fear is mentioned but not embodied in a live option she must surrender. The ending asserts risk and change without showing cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming navigation purpose after alien arrival—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or reversal. Elara's challenge (Council decommissioning towers) is resolved off-page through summary ("towers remained standing"). The ritual scene offers a tightening but lacks visible cost or consequence. Escalation remains conceptual rather than pressure-driven agency.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled: protect vulnerable voices by finding the photograph. No meaningful reversal occurs—each pulse leads cleanly to the next breadcrumb, and the discovery of the photograph feels like a fetch quest rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is observation rather than decision; Elara does not forfeit, refuse, or endure with visible cost. The whisper "Protect her story" is obeyed without complication, and the resolution ("slipped the photograph into her satchel") lacks dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the codex to understand Dr. Voss's disappearance—is signaled early but never genuinely tightens options. Elena encounters "crumbling walls and flooded chambers" yet no door, collapse, or timing crisis forces a trade-off. The vault door is "rusted shut but not impenetrable," dissolving the obstacle in the same breath. The phase-transition sequence is a gift rather than a test: the fleck "pulls her" into the undersea-cable realm, where Dr. Voss delivers a warning without demanding a choice. Agency is minimal; coincidence (the fleck's power, the water's aid) resolves the journey without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the death certificate error—is signaled early but remains abstract. The defragmentation sequences as a single extended action without reversals or meaningful tightening; luck and the ghost's voice resolve the mystery without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The ending declares wisdom "fetched from failure" but no on-page choice forecloses a path or pays a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is required; the inkblot-to-data alignment offers pattern intensification, but the closure lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—save the language—is signaled early and drives the sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the diamond begins draining Lira, but this cost arrives late and does not force a mid-scene trade-off; she presses on without a visible renunciation of an alternative path. The flock's "flight patterns mirroring the rhythm of her song" introduces a guiding mechanism at the climax without prior setup, weakening causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving cryptid origins via the arrowhead—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus after discovery in paragraph two. The phone call ("Metamorphose. Now.") and garden upheaval complicate without tightening options; Lena's laughter resolves the conflict through internal release rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The cryptid's directive ("the lock is within you") delivers the answer rather than forcing a trade-off. One tightening (finding the arrowhead) but no visible cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the orchard versus statues' mechanical grip—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Elara's realization about synchronization narrows her tactic from passive music to active heartbeat merging. Yet this turn is unmotivated by prior agency; she intuits the method without trial, error, or cost. The statues advance but dissolve without forcing a trade-off; roots solve the problem the protagonist did not help create. Escalation exists but the final act substitutes deus ex machina roots for protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—smuggling the bottle across the border to foster reconciliation—is signaled early. One on-page reversal occurs when the patrol drone gives chase, forcing Luma into evasive maneuvers. However, Luma succeeds easily ("was faster"), and the bottle's release produces the desired effect without complication or trade-off. No meaningful escalation follows the chase; the envoys' handshake and the calmed sky arrive as wish-fulfillment rather than earned cost. Agency is present (Elias plans and executes), but the resolution bypasses protagonist sacrifice or altered stance, lowering pressure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early but remains abstract. The discovery of the oasis provides one tightening, but the carousel's restoration happens without meaningful opposition or trade-off; the protagonist's singing simply works. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The fragment's warmth "urging him to act" replaces protagonist agency with object-driven convenience. Escalation under the accumulative lens requires a cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the shift is declared ("his heart full") rather than dramatized through a renunciation or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reawaken something lost—is signaled early but remains abstract. Three book-arrangement moves escalate in symbolic complexity (spiral, fractal, Möbius) without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. No reversal: the scarf floats, the doorway appears, she enters without cost. The closing paragraph asserts her guardian role but no on-page action forecloses an alternative path or demonstrates visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or tradeoff. No reversal or tightening occurs; the light pulses, she paints, the painting succeeds autonomously. Elara makes no decision that narrows options or incurs cost; the resolution is handed to her by the archipelago's inexplicable magic. Coincidence (pulsing light, self-vitalizing paint) resolves rather than complicates, violating the lens tests for all modes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara approaches, inserts the key, whispers a phrase, and the vault opens without genuine escalation or tightening. The "living entity" vault promises adaptive resistance but yields immediately, undercutting tension. The orb-shattering moment provides a turn, yet the cost is conceptual and off-stage ("everything around her felt different"), lacking the visible price or foreclosed option that would lift this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early. The missing mushroom → locket → constellation pattern offers a chain of discoveries, but each step unfolds as revelation rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. Elara encounters no resistance, makes no renunciation, and the ending delivers approval ("as if in approval") without visible cost. One meaningful tightening—recognition that grandmother "had known"—deepens understanding but does not escalate pressure or foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (annotate the shadow to free it) is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure is declared ("its shadow seemed to mock her," "weight that pressed her") but not dramatized through reversals or tightening choices—Elara's work proceeds smoothly to success. The annotation is completed without visible trade-off or narrowing of options; the shadow's "response" to her words is asserted, not earned by prior resistance. One deepening (tea-leaf geometry to written annotation) but no cost legible on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake ("preserve the color of wonder") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by on-page opposition or complication. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara plants the seed without friction, and it sprouts successfully. The resolution is awarded without visible cost—no renunciation, no path foreclosed, no price paid that alters her stance or future tactics. Pressure does not cohere or escalate; the ritual proceeds as a smooth, consequence-free sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stubborn knot refuses to yield, forcing Elara's whispered plea, but this resolves immediately without altering tactics or foreclosing an option. The spirits' resistance is told ("tightening as if unwilling to let go") rather than dramatized through a choice that costs Elara something concrete. The resolution arrives through endurance rather than a decision with visible price; Elara sits back "heavy but at ease" without a trade-off legible on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but does not visibly narrow options or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to reopen… the doors to understanding"—is declared but never pressured by a live obstacle or competing goal. Elara's work proceeds smoothly: she compares footage, notices a discrepancy, digs for days, and strikes the chapel without setback or tactical adjustment. No reversal or tightening occurs; the misalignment in the 2023 footage is raised as a question ("had the henge moved, or had the world around it changed?") but never answered or leveraged to narrow her options. The ending summarizes future scholars arriving but offers no on-page consequence or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and sustained. The map discovery and descent into the captain's study provide one meaningful tightening, and the letter narrows options by reframing the snow globe's significance. However, escalation is gentle and the final act of placing the globe on the floor feels more like acceptance than a choice with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, and the price of release is conceptual rather than embodied in a trade-off or loss that alters her tactics or situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara encounters no obstacle, cost, or reversal; her encoding simply works as intended. The "timeframe was crucial: between lightning and thunder" is declared but never dramatized as a constraint that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The resolution grants both protagonist and ghost what they want without visible price, undercutting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (decode the diary to understand the mentor's message) is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. Elara collects clues in sequence without opposition, failure, or cost that alters tactics. The encryption dissolves conveniently when the key is found; no puzzle requires sacrifice or error. The ending asserts emotional warmth without demonstrating what she gave up or what path closed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required—here, none narrows options or changes knowledge with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (proving her theory) is signaled early but never escalates through agency or tightening. The gondola failure is framed as "no accident," yet no antagonist or complication materializes; Elara simply waits, observes, and leaps when drawn. The leap itself is not a forced trade-off but a mystical summons; she feels a pull and follows. The resolution—waking with the string replaced—removes the initial constraint without on-page cost or sacrifice. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; pressure remains static from the glowing cloud's first appearance to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the book safe to "mirror the sky inside walls"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the building shudders violently, but Elara's agency is uncontested; no reversal, trade-off, or visible loss shapes her tactics. The ending asserts that "she had done it" without showing what she risked or gave up to complete the work.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (chart the next great discovery) is signaled early and remains coherent. The story delivers one tightening: symbols → glow → beam → hatch → chamber, but this progression feels mechanically sequential rather than escalatory. Elara's agency is observation and following rather than a decision that narrows options or imposes trade-off. The ending grants the map without visible cost—no sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed path—leaving pressure unfelt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the clockmaker's gear assortment to mend fractured prophecies. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecies' symbols point to the hidden door, narrowing her search. Yet the hall of mirrors does not present a live obstacle—she simply "pushed it open" and "reached for the gears" without resistance or cost; no locked mechanism, rival, or price paid on the page. The vortex of reflections delays her exit but resolves passively ("stepped back…the hall…fading"). Agency at closure is assertion ("newfound confidence") rather than a decision that forecloses a path, leaving escalation minimal under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the nebula—is declared early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Kael gathers allies without friction; the clapper is remembered and shaped without cost or setback. No reversal narrows options; the bell simply rings and the nebula conveniently returns. Agency is collective assembly, not a choice under competing pressure, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—prevent midnight—is signaled early but never tightens options. Elara's lullaby falters once, then resumes with "renewed determination" without a trade-off or visible cost. The puppet mends passively via "nested patterns" whose mechanics remain abstract. No on-page reversal forces a choice; the glow intensifies and success arrives without agency-driven escalation. Under the Hybrid lens, the ending reconfigures meaning (fragile hope vs. relentless clock) but lacks a live decision or forfeiture that narrows paths.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (break the curse, guide travelers) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the traveler's cry forces Elara to act, and the map enables the rescue. However, the escalation is linear rather than narrowing—Elara assembles the map without opposition, and the rescue succeeds without a trade-off or visible price paid on the page. The bud's emergence rewrites the orchard's state, but the cost is told ("less absolute") rather than felt. Agency at closure (planting the nut) is present but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses another live option.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting after grief—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening choice. Elena observes, reflects, and decides internally; no external complication forces a trade-off or narrows her options. The "pieces fall into place" phrase implies easing rather than escalation. The resolution is her own declaration of readiness without a visible price paid or a path foreclosed, leaving pressure flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories begin"—is declared but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The vial retrieval and incision proceed without complication or reversal; no on-page obstacle forces Elara to alter tactics or pay a visible price. The library's transformation is coincidental, not driven by protagonist agency under the chosen lens. Escalation is absent; the story moves through declaration rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (confronting stored remorse) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the sequence of memories, but no reversal or meaningful tightening narrows Elara's options; each memory is smoothed without visible cost or trade-off until the final shard. The shard's dissolution is presented as a triumph without depicting what Elara forfeits or how her later choices are constrained. Under an Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is sufficient, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating community division—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance. The gears turn "as if responding to her melody" without friction; the townsfolk gather and hum along without hesitation or dissent. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; coincidence (the crowd's immediate harmony) resolves the conflict. Mr. Kovar's story is recounted rather than dramatized, and no visible price is paid for this transformation—no stamina cost, no social risk, no tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting humanity's abandoned dreams—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's modification of the mirror proceeds without complication, and the "risky process" that "could unravel her mind" never manifests as threat or cost. The final "vow" is declaration, not a choice that forecloses a path or pays a price. Agency is withheld; luck and convenience (the mirror "shimmers" into a portal) resolve the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (find forgotten combinations) is signaled early and sustained. Gravity inversion introduces a meaningful pressure point that narrows access. However, escalation remains flat—each step (wade, float, follow doodle, align manuscript) proceeds without friction or visible cost. No on-page reversal forces Elara to sacrifice an option or pay a price; coincidence (the annual inversion) enables rather than complicates. The resolution awards the seed without dramatized struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the sculpture's music—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. Elara's method ("analyzing stress cracks") is mentioned, yet no on-page reversal tests her commitment or forces a trade-off. The porcelain insulator "calls to her" and later "amplifies" the music, but these are told effects without dramatized pressure. The ending asserts completion and lingering melody without showing what was risked, lost, or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—proving silence can bridge rather than cage—is signaled early. However, escalation operates through contemplative deepening rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. The chess pieces move "as if guided by an unseen hand," externalizing the turn rather than forcing Alara's agency. The knight's sacrifice and the toppled king symbolize closure but lack an on-page trade-off: no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The resolution—returning as a guide—arrives as insight rather than a decision tested by competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the grandmother's diary to understand empathy—is signaled early but never tested. No escalation: Elara attempts once, succeeds immediately, and the diary reveals exactly what she hoped. No reversal, no tightening, no visible price paid. The fireworks arrive as ambient celebration, not a deadline that forced a trade-off. Agency is minimal; the protagonist's "method" (tuning frequencies) is gestural rather than decision-based, and the resolution is comfort without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seed's growth and Elara's vivid dreams, but escalation is textural rather than dramatic; no choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "undercurrent of wisdom" surge is a passive revelation, not earned through Elara's agency. The story offers a deepening (recognition that ambition kept her from the present) but the cost is abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only a stance adjustment told in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. Elara follows the arrow tip's cues (it pulses, flares, projects a map) rather than making choices that foreclose options. The "echoes are fading" complication is told in a summary beat, not dramatized as a constraint that forces a trade-off. The resolution (pressing the artifact into the stone) is a single mechanical act with no visible cost, no loss of alternative, and no tactical alteration. The inversion hour, declared as chaotic, passes without affecting her movements or decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disaster to prevent future ones—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma. Elara encounters clues in sequence without facing a reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The wreckage and patch confirm her hypothesis without complication. The ending reiterates her mission statement rather than showing a cost paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"unfetter wonder"—is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or internal conflict. No reversal occurs; Elara begins poised to act and completes the task as planned with no visible cost or narrowed options. The "moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble" reads as a symbolic deadline rather than a live constraint that alters her tactics. The story lacks a tightening or deepening that would foreclose a path or force a trade-off; the ending confirms success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the flute and understand past failure) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara reaches the flute and hesitates, but the reversal deflates immediately—her desire "outweighed her fear" with no visible trade-off. The climactic choice to play the flute arrives without a live cost; she simply proceeds. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency at closure is assertion rather than renunciation or endurance with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge under the inferred lens. The "surge of emotions" and "struggle to ground himself" are told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost. Agency is passive throughout: Elias receives sensations rather than making a decision that forecloses a path. Pressure does not escalate; the piece loops through mood description without a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—delivering the pendant—is signaled early but pressure flatlines. The pendant's hum intensifies across beats yet Elara's options never narrow; she walks forward without obstacle or trade-off. The scholar's reveal substitutes for earned escalation. No on-page cost: Elara gains purpose without visible sacrifice, and the fade "calls to her" as bonus rather than price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: prove the theory that objects absorb emotions. The experiment setup creates expectation, and the communion beat delivers a reversal (grief instead of neutral data). However, Elara's response is immediate acceptance rather than a forced trade-off; no visible tactic shift or renunciation follows the discovery. The ending reconfigures her motivation from proof to witness, but this deepening lacks an on-page cost that narrows options—she simply continues with expanded scope. One meaningful pressure point present but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"carry a message across impossible distance"—is declared but never tested on the page; Elara encounters no opposition, resource limit, or fork that forces a trade-off. Puzzle assembly and journey unfold as sequential discovery without reversal. The bridge appears as reward rather than costly decision. No agency-driven tightening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—planetary renewal—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Eli accepts the bargain despite fear, but the descent and weaving face no reversals or escalating costs; the silk "guides him" passively. The ground trembles, light explodes, and the planet heals without tactical sacrifice or visible price. Escalation under the Causal lens requires narrowing options; here coincidence (the silk's inherent power) resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma. Elara encounters no obstacle requiring trade-off; the woman simply explains and hands her a second shard. The shard glows conveniently when Elara feels frustrated, and combining the shards solves the mystery without foreclosing options or extracting price. Escalation is cosmetic (repair bay → forest → back) rather than narrowing; the final "responsibility" is embraced without visible renunciation or competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse's purpose—is signaled but pressure plateaus rather than escalates. The lamp flickering is a complication, but Elias solves it by relighting without visible trade-off or narrowed options. The stone-rearrangement (3-1-2 to 2-3-1) opens a compartment, a discovery beat rather than a choice under duress. The ending declaration of resolve is not tested by an on-page reversal or cost. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the final action (lighting the lamp) is uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("shape a new dawn") is declared but never tested by a credible obstacle. The beam "no longer under their control" moment promises escalation, but the Herald grasps the wick and succeeds without visible struggle or trade-off. The fog "resisted, twisting and churning" is told, not dramatized as a constraint that narrows options or forces a choice between competing goods. Closure grants the Herald exactly what they sought with no felt price—the beings bow, the dawn arrives, and the Herald laughs triumphantly. No meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why stories magnetize—is declared but never tested with a concrete trade-off. Kael's conversation with the woman offers advice without visible cost to him; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The structure is linear drift rather than escalation: Kael arrives, places the wing, talks, leaves. Coincidence (he "feels the pull") initiates contact rather than protagonist agency driving a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled: repair/understand the labyrinth's sorrow repository. Pressure accumulates through the sextant's deconstruction and the dream fragments coalescing, constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. No reversal or narrowing choice tests Elias's commitment; the sextant heals passively in moonlight without a decision or trade-off. Cost remains declared ("weight of what trees witness") rather than a visible forfeiture that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindle the realm—is signaled early but never escalates under pressure. Elara's song-gathering proceeds without opposition, failed attempts, or visible cost; the "final thread eluded her" is resolved in the same paragraph by sitting and remembering. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The mirror world "whispers" guidance, and the greenhouse transforms off Elara's voice alone—coincidence completes the task without protagonist agency that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for meaning—is signaled early but escalates through summary rather than tightening choices. The conclave's "nestled paradoxes" are told to her by Thaddeus, not discovered through on-page friction. One micro-turn occurs when she finds blank pages, yet this deflates rather than narrows options: it gives her permission to embrace contradictions without visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; she simply decides to stop hiding, with no dramatized consequence or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring beauty to the courtyard—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or tightening challenges Elara's methods or forces a trade-off. The plaque discovery and bread appearance affirm rather than complicate her quest, and no visible cost (time, resource, social friction) emerges on the page. Coincidence supplies solutions (bread, plaque) without protagonist agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving luminous vows against oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the unusual slide's frequencies spike and the library trembles, forcing Elara's realization that slides are keys, not just records. Agency is present but largely reactive: the slide transforms and calls to her; she responds by working with renewed purpose. The final cost (clash of meticulous nature with urgency) is stated rather than dramatically tested. Escalation is one-step rather than compounding; no visible trade-off or loss shapes tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (expose the betrayal, protect the truce) is signaled early. Lila's confrontation with the thieves is the single pressure point, but she wins through verbal assertion without a visible trade-off or tightening that forecloses an option. The men "shift uneasily" and she walks away; no cost is paid, no resource spent, no path closed. The ending declares success ("she'd thwarted the thieves") but the mechanics of that success are not dramatized. Escalation is minimal; the story reads as situational setup without a turn that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early but never tested with meaningful opposition. The ring's taste guidance provides one tightening (metallic danger, sweet opportunity leading her to the clearing), but no reversal forces a trade-off. The cloaked figure's explanation resolves the mystery through exposition; Elara's acceptance arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Pressure remains declarative rather than escalating through embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity—is signaled early and sustained. The discovery of the forgotten painting provides one tightening moment, but Elara's agency is passive reception rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. The broken lock is placed beside the finished painting as symbolic closure, yet no visible price is paid; the text asserts liberation without showing what she sacrifices or risks in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (finding lost conversations to understand the oasis's loss) is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara hears whispers of betrayal and her leaves begin to wilt, forcing her to step back. Yet the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff—she inscribes the conversations anyway, and the cost (what does she give up? what path does this foreclose?) remains told rather than shown. The water trickle at the end suggests consequence but arrives as a reward, not a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to preserve the color of wonder"—is declared but never tested. No on-page obstacle or cost threatens her goal; the sculpture succeeds without friction, the bells chime, and she departs satisfied. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing does. The piece lacks escalation or a meaningful tightening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the farm and resolving her static—is signaled early. The box opening provides one meaningful tightening when the fears threaten to consume the farm, forcing Elara's miniaturization choice. However, the escalation feels declarative ("brutal," "relentless") rather than shown through tactical choices that narrow her options. The cost of losing nostalgic memories is present but told in summary rather than demonstrated through what she can no longer do or feel in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the mailbox mystery—is signaled early but never tightens through Clara's agency. The locket conveniently contains the key; Mrs. Ellis conveniently appears to explain; the letter conveniently delivers theme. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "sandstorm calm" moment at closure is asserted rather than earned through escalation. Cost is invisible; Clara gains insight without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("liberate knowledge") is abstract and never tested on the page by a choice that costs Elara something tangible. Pressure does not escalate through because/therefore linkage; the dance simply succeeds without complication. No reversal narrows her options, and the final "passages now open" is a convenience gain rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path or forces a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (recover deleted memories) is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening; Eli recites patterns, the air shifts, he steps forward, and succeeds without friction or trade-off. Coincidence (the mysterious fluctuation) resolves the quest rather than protagonist agency. The cost of retrieval is not legible on the page; the ending grants satisfaction without forfeiture or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page obstacle. Elara's ritual proceeds without reversal, tightening, or visible trade-off; the prophecy "resists" in metaphor ("thrashing like a trapped animal") but no action or choice changes tactics or forecloses an option. The piece teaches an accumulative lens through ritual texture, yet pressure remains static: Elara focuses, the wing glows, success is declared. No meaningful escalation or deepening narrows her path, and coincidence does not complicate—the ritual simply works as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—is signaled early but remains declarative rather than tested under pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Clara's options; Elias lectures, she listens, and she accepts the pouch without complication. The sugar-borrowing "method" is prescribed rather than discovered through struggle. Agency is present in the final knock but the cost is minimal—no visible trade-off, no foreclosed alternative, no felt consequence that would elevate the moment into genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's journey from skepticism to belief and isolation to independence—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete dilemma or cost. The shell floods her with memories, yet she never resists, weighs alternatives, or sacrifices anything to accept the archivist mantle. The figure's dialogue declares transformation ("now it's time to turn that strength into independence") rather than forcing a choice that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; pressure remains constant from shell-touch to sunrise, and the protagonist's passivity ("she didn't resist") undercuts agency at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to forgive her father and release bitterness—is signaled early and sustained. However, pressure remains static: she hesitates once, then proceeds without complication or counter-pull. No reversal narrows options; no on-page cost forces a trade-off. The scroll's erasure is the climax, but it unfolds as a meditative inevitability rather than a choice under competing pressures. Agency is present (she chooses to erase), but the act forecloses no live alternative path with felt cost. The "wisely enduring, I must forgive" line summarizes rather than dramatizes the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"why some people echo"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara's journey involves no reversals or tightening; she seeks, finds a figure, looks into a pool, and receives the answer without sacrifice or competing pressures. The figure's test ("ensure you are ready") is passed by declaration ("I am") with no visible price. Escalation is absent; the structure is quest-and-exposition rather than pressure accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to salvage something pure"—is signaled but never tested by opposition or a live trade-off. Elara assembles the family's story without encountering resistance, error, or resource cost; the visions arrive in sequence without escalation or a turn that narrows her options. The globe "clears" at the end without causal pressure or protagonist agency driving the change. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the final glow reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to uncover hidden patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces on-page testing or escalation. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; she contemplates, her thoughts "crystallize," and she departs with unchanged understanding. The whistle's echo offers a micro-moment of curiosity but leads nowhere. No choice narrows options, no cost is paid, and coincidence does not complicate because nothing happens beyond reflection. Under any lens (causal, accumulative, situational), pressure must cohere and tighten once with visible cost; this piece offers stasis without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (contain the stillpoint threat) is signaled late, only emerging after the diamond's hidden message. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara discovers, then immediately solves. The climax (chant, press diamond) lacks escalation—no failed attempt, no visible trade-off. Coincidence resolves: the shredded letters "seemed to shift" into a guide without prior setup of her ability to use them this way.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Escalation appears (new frequency, weeks of deciphering, storm climax) yet the tightening lacks a visible trade-off: no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no secondary pressure forces a choice between competing goods. The voice's command and Elias's compliance bypass agency; coincidence (the frequency arrives unbidden) complicates but the protagonist does not drive the turn. Cost is declared ("sacrifices," "work was far from over") but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is Elias's quest to capture and "sweeten" sounds for redemptive translation. One tightening occurs when the music box resists (jammed gears), forcing him to coax it; this narrows tactics briefly. The music box then plays autonomously, a reversal not driven by protagonist agency—luck complicates rather than being earned by his choice. No visible price is paid; the dropped jar shatters but Elias "didn't flinch," and the ending grants fulfillment ("felt whole") without foreclosing an alternative path or showing what he sacrificed to reach this point.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (protect the key) is signaled early, and the vibration creates rising pressure. However, escalation is undermined by passivity: Elara "hesitated," then the key itself glows and drives the figure away. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the artifact solves the problem without Elara foreclosing an option or paying a visible price. The figure's visions complicate but do not force a costly decision—Elara's final action is reactive, not a choice that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—sculpting patience—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice with visible cost. Elara's actions (mapping, observing, tracking) proceed without reversal, complication, or trade-off. The arrival of visitors late in the text adds no friction; they simply adopt her methods without conflict. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a pattern of preventable deaths—is signaled early and pursued through the journal. Pressure tightens as clues converge on the mentor's complicity, but the resolution occurs off-stage: Elara "emerges" with proof and feels free without dramatizing the confrontation or showing what path is foreclosed. The climax (finding the photograph) is a reveal, not a choice under pressure. No visible trade-off or cost appears in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Thomas deserves belief and whether Elias will act on his doubt—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through reflection and Alistair's pointed remarks rather than a dramatized reversal or tightening choice. The repair of the heart offers a micro-turn (it ticks again), but this is Alistair's action, not Elias's agency. Elias's final resolve to "face the storm" is a stance crystallization, yet it occurs in interiority without an on-page trade-off or visible cost: no lost ally, no renounced safety, no immediate consequence that alters his next move. Under an Accumulative lens one deepening moment is sufficient, but here the deepening is conceptual and the cost abstract, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the yearning algorithm—is signaled early and drives her work across weeks. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell motif emerges in the transliterated images, narrowing her focus. However, escalation remains declarative ("heart raced," "machine whirred faster") without a visible trade-off or forfeited option. The bell's ring resolves the quest but no on-page cost is legible; Lira returns to her workbench with "new ideas" in an open posture that lacks felt sacrifice or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—solving the cold case—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The recurring numbers provide a pattern but no meaningful tightening: each discovery (timestamps, user IDs, song rhythm, coordinates) adds information without narrowing options or forcing a tradeoff. The system lockout and bypass sequence is told in summary ("she bypassed the archive's security protocols") rather than dramatized with tactical cost. The final decision to "expose the truth" lacks on-page consequence or visible price; the story ends on intent rather than action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is clear: reconstitute the crystal ball to restore balance. The vintage store mirrors provide a meaningful tightening—each reflection narrows understanding and builds resolve—but the resolution is handed to Elara by the "unseen force" that assembles the fragments. No on-page reversal or trade-off forces her to sacrifice or choose between competing goods; the fragments float together without her agency driving the final act. Pressure accumulates through the mirror sequence but deflates when the climax arrives unbidden, capping the score in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to understand endings—is signaled early but never tightened or tested by reversal. She arrives, listens, reflects, and departs with affirmed insight; no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The man's question momentarily raises pressure, but Elara's answer is philosophical rather than costly. Coincidence (the ice storm, Mara's appearance) complicates setting but does not force agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search to understand her past relationship and her role as "mismatch"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure remains internal and reflective rather than escalating through external opposition or narrowed options. The piece offers a deepening (vineyard symmetry reframes her view) but no reversal that forecloses a live path or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution is a shift in perspective ("learning to dance with the mismatches") without agency-driven consequence that alters her situation on the page, keeping the score in mid-range under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom before it vanishes—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or trade-off tightens options; Elara performs the ritual without interference, and the prophet's arrival confirms success rather than forcing a choice. Coincidence (the prophet simply appears) resolves the declared tension. No on-page action narrows a path or forecloses an alternative with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective pain into healing—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara encounters no opposition, reversal, or tightening choice; she arranges photos in chronological order without friction. No agency decision forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. The vines' shift from "decay" to "resilience" is observed, not earned through protagonist action. Pressure remains flat from setup through exit.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the pattern to restore lost language. Pressure accumulates as fractured sequences coalesce, and the crystal drains—a tightening that narrows Elias's window. However, escalation is gradual accretion rather than a live decision point that forces a trade-off. The cost (crystal spent, purpose fulfilled) arrives as inevitable consequence rather than a protagonist choice that forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present but agency feels passive.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: capturing the sound of growing older. However, the escalation is flat—Elias moves from sculpture to sculpture marking lines without meaningful resistance, complication, or tightening of options. No live choice forces a trade-off; the sound arrives as discovery rather than as a consequence of agency or renunciation. The ending reconfigures his stance (he no longer needs the chalk), which provides a mild deepening, but the cost is atmospheric rather than dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, one density shift suffices, but the protagonist's passivity keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing the ephemeral—is signaled early but never tightens through a live choice or reversal. Elara studies, realizes, and succeeds in sequence without meaningful opposition or cost that narrows options. The clock hand's relentless motion is declared a problem, yet "the gears were intact, its springs unwound," offering no material constraint to overcome. The ending claims she "learned to move with it," but no on-page decision or renunciation makes that learning visible or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—helping Mrs. Bennett say goodbye—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Elara calls Claire, Claire arrives, reconciliation happens without visible resistance or cost. The story presents a problem and its solution in sequence rather than a tightening that forecloses options. No on-page reversal or deepening alters Elara's tactics; the outcome feels preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the void opens at the precipice, but the escalation is more procedural (relearn runes, activate key) than pressured by agency or trade-off. The key's activation resolves the mystery without dramatized cost or a live option foreclosed; Elara watches "in awe" rather than enduring visible sacrifice or choice under duress. The next awakening is "imminent" but never tests Elara's commitment with a competing good or unavoidable harm.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—healing the changeling, the village, and herself—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the fountain woman simply asks for "a piece of your certainty," and Elara complies without dramatized friction or trade-off. The substitute body guilt arrives late and does not create escalation. The resolution (stone drop → transformation) feels granted rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and sustained. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Lira's options: the polishing proceeds smoothly, the glass glows as hoped, and she walks to the village without friction. Coincidence (moonlight arriving to amplify the glow) aids rather than complicates. The resolution lacks a felt trade-off; her peace and readiness are declared, not dramatized through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Elara's search for a protected space to heal. Kai's arrival introduces a tightening—will she open or withdraw?—but the pressure resolves into gentle alignment rather than a trade-off. The notebook exchange is a micro-reversal (discovery of shared observation) yet lacks a visible price; the ending images them "side by side" in mutual understanding without any path foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present (the realization "we're not alone"), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—collecting and solemnizing hopes—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. Elara walks deeper, encounters cameos, and places the shell without escalation or narrowing of options. The ephemeral figures offer no resistance; they simply pass through and leave stories. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible price alters tactics. The final act (writing) is declared resolution without prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. Elara hums, the tendril glows, the songs return: each step is additive without reversal or cost. The story declares that alignment is "crucial" yet applies no time pressure or failure consequence, leaving escalation as mood rather than structure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.7)
    A dominant stake ("translate heartbeats into maps") is signaled early but never tested. Elara arranges objects, applies starlight, seals the pattern, and succeeds without friction, reversal, or visible cost. The tremor is a decorative beat, not an escalation or tightening that narrows options. No agency-driven turn forces a trade-off; the resolution is frictionless execution of her stated plan.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (repair the timer to harvest echoes) is signaled early. The story offers one meaningful turn: the dusk-angle discovery that enables repair. However, this breakthrough arrives without visible prior failure, constraint, or tradeoff; Elias "noticed" rather than tested and sacrificed. The resolution—timer hums, echoes converge, peace follows—proceeds without legible cost: no omission, no foreclosed path, no tactical price paid on the page. Agency reads as observation ("closed his eyes, listening") rather than decision under narrowed options. The ending declares fulfillment ("wonder would never truly be lost") without dramatizing what was risked or renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's burden-collection purpose versus the figure's invitation to transcend it—is signaled early and tightens through the figure's question "Do you ever set it down?" The crack in her "calcified layers" registers as internal pressure. Yet the escalation remains conversational rather than causal; no on-page action tests her commitment before the shift. The ending gesture ("weave…her own") is a stated intention without immediate visible cost or a renounced alternative. Pressure coheres under a Situational lens but lacks the decisive tightening or trade-off that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into meaning through the carving—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation is minimal: Elara's work proceeds without resistance, the challenging mane is overcome with "renewed focus," and no live option is foreclosed. The concept "here and gone" is contemplated but doesn't tighten choices or create a trade-off. The ending satisfies thematically but lacks a visible or felt price that alters tactics or forecloses a path, keeping this below the 7.0 threshold for meaningful tightening with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost/eroded ambitions—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that narrows options. The camera wheel's voice provides encouragement rather than forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The ending declares hope and forward motion without a visible price paid or a tactic altered; the "fractured stillness" shifts meaning via narration alone, not through a choice or renunciation that costs something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding hope equations through structural resurrection—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or sacrifice. Eli's experiment proceeds without reversal, obstacle, or visible trade-off; the terminal "responds" conveniently. The ending declares transformation ("new equation for hope") without showing what was risked or lost, leaving escalation flat and cost asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens through the whispers' insistence and the encounter with the unfinished clock. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara moves from passive longing to active reconciliation by inscribing the clock face, forecloses the path of avoidance, and accepts coexistence with visible cost (hours of labor, the weight lifted). The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the coincidence of the whispers complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or choice with visible cost. Elara encounters no meaningful resistance: the barge is there, the chest intact, the journal legible, the sundial obligingly glows at the needed moment. No reversal narrows her options; the walk from canal edge to barge to journal to dawn proceeds as acquisition without escalation. The stated "warning, call to action" at the end does not alter her stance on the page or foreclose a path—she stands tall with both objects, stakes unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (decode the knots to preserve knowledge) is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. No reversal, complication, or price appears—Elara examines, pauses, realizes, and succeeds in a linear glide. The text offers no moment where her agency forecloses an alternative or incurs visible cost. The resolution is handed to her by the rope itself: "the last knot yielded its meaning."

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the geography of healing" through witnessing—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or tradeoff. The woman's waiting and weeping provide a passive tableau; the traveler's act of writing and reading the obituary aloud proceeds without friction, cost, or a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The thread exchange at the end is gifted without sacrifice, and the traveler's internal state does not visibly tighten or deepen. Under the Accumulative lens, one expects a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the final image ("part of the same tapestry") declares synthesis without demonstrating it through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring beauty to a mechanical world—is signaled early but remains abstract. The descent and assembly create a sequence but no reversal; each piece "clicked into place" without resistance or trade-off. The machine's voice offers conceptual friction ("understand its cost"), yet Kael's subsequent actions do not narrow live options. The vision sequence and return to the palace imply future struggle but do not foreclose a path on the page with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—to prove scars can sing, to graft life into barren ground—is signaled early. However, the piece lacks a meaningful on-page tightening or reversal; Elara begins to plant and completes the act without complication, opposition, or a moment where options narrow. The acknowledgment that "the graft might fail" is reflective, not dramatic. Agency is present (she plants) but the cost is deferred and hypothetical rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation relies on breadcrumb collection without meaningful narrowing of options or rising cost; each shard discovery feels identical in pressure. The box's glow "testing her, demanding she prove her worth" is told rather than dramatized through on-page choices that foreclose paths. The final assembly reversal (box as catalyst, not prison) shifts understanding but lacks protagonist agency; Elara's action is mechanical insertion, not a decision with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"share light without using fire"—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. Elara's sonar pinging and the gear's glow intensify in parallel summary phrases without a turning point where she must choose, forfeit, or endure with visible cost. The garden "responds" passively; no antagonistic pressure forces trade-offs. Escalation is asserted ("the weight of her purpose") rather than dramatized through agency under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early but never faces a concrete test or tightening. Elara's work proceeds without setback, and the "renewed purpose" arrives via internal epiphany rather than pressure. The ribbon insight is a cognitive leap, not a choice that forecloses options or costs her something on the page. No reversal narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a moment where Elias must choose between competing goods. The escalation unfolds through reflection and summary outreach (fisherman, baker) rather than a tightening that narrows options. No reversal or visible price alters tactics; the town simply "began to mend" without friction. The peaceful ending grants resolution without forfeiting a live alternative, leaving pressure accumulative but never tested.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to "give voice to the voiceless"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure remains steady rather than escalating: Elias works methodically without reversals, obstacles, or competing costs. The chess clock "long since run down" suggests elapsed time but imposes no deadline that narrows options. The resolution ("a piece of humanity…intentions endure") is a realization without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or tightening is missing; the work proceeds linearly to completion without a turn that reweights cost or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—seed innovation within constraints—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening: the quill moves "as if it had a mind of its own," externalizing agency and bypassing protagonist decision. The scroll's completion is frictionless; no resource (time, ink, doubt) runs short, no tactic fails and requires adjustment. Coincidence (the quill's autonomous guidance) resolves the challenge without Ignorance risking or losing anything. The ending declares success without visible cost or trade-off scaled to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories—is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. The pirate broadcast arrives as gift rather than obstacle; Clara "frantically" transcribes but faces no resistance, competing demands, or cost. The song slows "as if to give her time," removing friction. Her closing resolve ("teach the dust to tell stories, one note, one word, at a time") is asserted without a preceding choice that narrows options or tests commitment. No reversal or deepening that changes knowledge or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring the gallery owner through ritual—is signaled early but never tested. Elara faces no opposition, internal friction, or trade-off; she simply executes the plan. No escalation or deepening occurs; the scattering proceeds as intended from the start. The cost is claimed in reflection ("acceptance of fragility") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or altered tactic. Agency is intention without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The declared stake—preserve the past versus embrace the future—is outlined in the Kael/Lira exchange but never escalates into a concrete on-page dilemma. Kael "hesitated" then "followed Lira" with minimal friction; the collapse is told second-hand and the artifact retrieval occurs offstage, so no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The ending insight ("room for both") resolves the tension conceptually without visible cost, agency, or a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful escalation under any lens—Causal linkage is weak (because Lira arrives with news, Kael follows without complication), and Accumulative pressure does not deepen or shift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve vanishing arts by creating harmony—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the dwindling choir and encroaching indifference, and one tightening occurs when Elara instructs students to sing "not to be heard, but to listen." However, no live resistance or complication tests this method; students trust immediately, the hums intertwine without friction, and the performance succeeds without visible cost. Agency is present (Elara's decision to act), but the escalation is textural deepening without a moment where options narrow or a price becomes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—growing the knowledge fruit to inspire a "gentle rebellion"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. The celestial alignment is declared "once-in-a-lifetime" yet does not tighten decisions; Elara plants, meditates, and prunes without opposition or visible trade-off. Her doubts ("What if the fruit didn't work?") are stated but immediately dissolved by the grandmother's wisdom rather than forcing a choice. The fruit's success is delivered via summary ("by dawn… heavy with glowing orbs") with no earned reversal or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the tower's mystery—is signaled early but never tightened by a trade-off or live opposition. Elara's descent is frictionless: the key fits, the staircase appears, the orb grants visions without risk or refusal. The "sacrifice" of the drones is told in summary during the vision, not tested on the page. No reversal narrows her options; the resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake ("to understand why some houses feel alive") is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; Elias collects objects without resistance, speaks softly, and feels a difference—all with zero visible price. The claimed escalation ("quiet intensity building") is emotional summary, not a turn driven by protagonist agency that narrows tactics or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's mission to save her village with the serum. Liora's telepathic warning creates one meaningful complication (Elara pauses, tightens grip, reconsiders), but the resolution—"adjustments that accounted for its fragility"—occurs entirely off-page weeks later. No on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment under fire; the core conflict (fragility vs. healing power) is acknowledged, then told as solved. Pressure coheres but never tightens into a visible trade-off or forfeiture within the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's obsession with perpetual motion as philosophical ideal and her struggle with a missed opportunity—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the chipped die slips away, forcing her to roll the remaining die. Yet this moment lacks agency: the die slips by accident, and her decision to roll the pristine die doesn't visibly narrow options or impose a trade-off. The resolution (continuing her ascent with lighter weight) asserts progress without demonstrating a price paid or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the painting to "rouse" the lost language—is signaled but never tightened or tested. No reversal narrows options; the brush "urges," the vision "unfolds," and the painting "comes alive" without resistance or trade-off. Escalation is declarative ("hours passed," "exhaustion faded") rather than dramatized through constrained choice. Cost is not legible on the page; the ending asserts purpose without foreclosing a live alternative or paying a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying tradition—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition. Elara's plan works immediately: the bread draws the crowd, the lens approves, laughter echoes, tradition spreads. No tightening or deepening narrows her options; no visible price is paid. The honey and lens arrive as conveniences that solve rather than complicate. Agency is present in the decision to bake and share, but the execution bypasses friction entirely, leaving escalation and felt cost absent.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: unlock the hunger stone to bend time. The stone's glow intensifying and the lighthouse shuddering provides a single meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's options. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric—the island "resisting"—rather than forcing a trade-off between competing goods. The "final adjustment" that triggers the climax lacks specificity about what choice or sacrifice Elias makes in that moment. Cost is declared ("at what cost?") but not concretely demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting fear to lift its hold—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options; the advisor's riddles guide Clara to an epiphany without forcing a trade-off or visible price. The climax (mirrors shattering, luminance intensifying) happens to Clara rather than through her agency. The cost—"fear lifted from her shoulders"—is declared relief, not a foreclosed path or paid consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (interpreting the clouds' message, resolving restlessness) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Leeward strikes notes, the clouds respond cooperatively, and the orchard harmonizes—no reversal, no trade-off, no escalation. The "restlessness" is declared resolved in a single uncontested sequence, and agency reduces to uninterrupted action rather than a choice that forecloses an option or incurs visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the gate rusted and what lies beyond—is signaled early. The sequence tightens from gate to tunnel to chamber, but the climactic moment (approaching the pedestal, using the whistle) proceeds without opposition or trade-off; the watchers do not stop her, and the shell's voice provides answers freely. No live option is foreclosed; the ending launches a new quest rather than forcing a decision or endurance with visible cost. Escalation is structural (deeper descent) rather than driven by protagonist agency testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—rescue truth from noble lies—is signaled early and remains consistent. Yet Elara faces no meaningful opposition or reversal; she arrives, searches methodically, finds the archive without setback. The "reminder that even lies could be acts of love" adds nuance but arrives as reflection rather than a turn that narrows options. No live cost or trade-off pressures the final image; escalation is replaced by smooth accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unearthing and restoring forgotten dreams—is signaled early but never tested. Elias encounters the journal and mosaic as discoveries that confirm his intent rather than complicate it; no reversal or tightening forces him to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The repairs proceed without opposition, and the ending grants him success ("the lagoon seemed to whisper its gratitude") with no foreclosed path or felt cost. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (uncover truth) is signaled but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The blackout is declared a catalyst but imposes no tactical constraint on Elara's movements. The map-alignment and stamp-press "open" hidden passages via authorial fiat, not protagonist agency with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—she moves linearly through discovery without renunciation or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can transform grief through craft—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful turn occurs when Lira's challenge ("Perhaps the transformation you seek is not in the craft, but in the letting go") reframes his approach, and a second when he unfolds the crane and renounces escape. However, both turns rely on reflection and symbolic gesture rather than decisions under live pressure with visible trade-offs. The escalation is more conceptual than causal: the basilica visit and crane-unfolding deepen understanding but don't foreclose a live option or exact a felt price on tactics. No antagonistic force adapts or complicates; the resolution arrives through epiphany rather than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding unused potential and purpose—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure doesn't escalate; Zara moves from examining crystals to more examining crystals to an insight, with no meaningful tightening or reversal. The drone strike provides backstory weight but generates no on-page opposition or complication. The "hunt" is contemplative without tactical shifts, agency choices, or visible costs that narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—find three pieces to unlock the matrix chip—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Yet no live opposition or meaningful tightening appears: each piece is found exactly where the star charts suggest, without complication or cost. The drone's sensor alerts function as a treasure-map cheat, and Kael's "perpetually surprised demeanor" shifts to "focus" then "determination" without any on-page sacrifice or forfeited path. The holographic activation at the end resolves the hunt without a visible price or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking redemption for manufacturing a false lineage—is clear from the opening. Pressure accumulates through his examination of the driftwood, and the watch-carving alignment triggers the surfaced memory that deepens his guilt. However, escalation relies heavily on internal reflection rather than external resistance; no choice actively forecloses an option with visible cost until the vague final commitment. The "quell" action is more passive meditation than agency-driven decision that narrows tactical paths.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of apology/forgiveness between kingdoms—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elara delivers her pitch uninterrupted, Kael voices one objection, then acquiesces. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; the negotiation unfolds as persuasion without friction. Agency manifests as Kael's nod, but no prior tactic is abandoned and no cost legibly paid. The piece offers situational crystallization without the tightening or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    One dominant stake is clear: restore navigation confidence and find purpose beyond regret. Pressure accumulates through reflection on the compass failure and the poles as a lifeline, but the escalation is textural rather than causal tightening—no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The ending reconfigures her stance (she no longer needs the compass), yet the cost is conceptual ("backlash still lingered") without a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift in the final beat. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening consistent with the Accumulative lens, but the price remains implied rather than dramatized at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—seeking empathy or understanding—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Elias's journey into the lake is contemplative rather than escalatory; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The baseball's loss could pressure a choice, but Elias watches it sink without struggle. The ending shifts perspective via reflection ("empathy… something to carry") without on-page cost or a decision that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma or tightening choice on the page. The guardian offers the pivot ("let go of the past") as dialogue rather than forcing Elara into a trade-off. No reversal: the conjuring succeeds without cost, the guardian transforms cooperatively, and Elara accepts the new understanding without foreclosing an old path. Coincidence enables rather than complicates: the fortune cookie conveniently appears, the scent trail leads directly to the solution. Agency is minimal—Elara follows cues and receives wisdom rather than making a decision under competing pressures. Cost is declared ("weight of her past lift") but not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (finding where lost time accumulates) is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; the saucer glows and grants a vision without resistance or trade-off. The resolution arrives via magical convenience rather than protagonist agency, and the cost of her absence is told in reflection rather than dramatized. One micro turn (shedding the brooch) offers symbolic weight but does not foreclose a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (unlock the dimension to save humanity) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: Elara prepares for years (summary), approaches the anomaly, performs stitching, and succeeds without complication. The dimension's "scars" are observed but do not resist or test her method. "Shadow work" is declared necessary but never dramatized as internal friction—no moment where confronting darkness costs her composure, time, or certainty. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure; the sequence reads as procedural execution without escalation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake ("understand the texture of transformation") is signaled early but remains abstract. The detour deepens curiosity without narrowing options; Elara follows the hush without visible trade-off or refused alternative. The climactic bottle-opening is framed as transformative act, yet no on-page price is paid—she releases the bugs and gains insight, with renewal rather than loss. The whispering hush's message serves as external validation rather than protagonist-won knowledge. One meaningful pressure point (the urge to detour) lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early. The sequence tightens from blackout to discovery to confrontation, but Thorne's arrival generates minimal opposition; his hesitation and loosening grip offer no real escalation. Elara activates the key without sacrifice or tactical adjustment, and the cradle's success is immediate and unqualified. The "silent revolution" rhetoric promises moral weight, yet no on-page cost or trade-off charges the final act. One meaningful pressure point (the confrontation) exists, but it deflates rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding sacred patterns) is signaled early and remains coherent. The sequence—placing rocks, scattering dust—provides one meaningful tightening, but the escalation feels mechanical rather than driven by protagonist agency; Kael executes a planned ritual without encountering resistance or forced trade-offs. The eels' synchronized movement and aurora's surge are spectacle, not obstacles. No visible price is paid; Kael achieves enlightenment and departs satisfied, with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting the past via the map—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the envelope simply confirms what Elara "knew" it contained, and the storm "pauses" conveniently at the moment of clarity. The final act (beginning to write) lacks visible cost because no prior scene shows what censorship protected or what "uncensored" writing will forfeit. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the "hidden overture"—is signaled early but never tested. The verbal "duel" lacks escalation; each exchange is interchangeable abstraction without narrowing options or raising cost. Mara's "hesitation" and shift to "curiosity" are told summaries, not embodied reversals. No on-page tightening, trade-off, or price alters tactics; the resolution is a mutual philosophical agreement with zero friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming the library into a sanctuary—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; Elias and Clara simply "work," and the library "glows with newfound vitality" by declaration. The poems go from "scattered like leaves" to painted on walls, but the transition is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is present (they choose to rebuild) but costs are invisible—no stamina, resource, or social friction materializes. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the ending softens rather than sharpens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the film reel to "surprise fate"—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition. Elara follows compasses, finds the reel on a pedestal, loads it, and steps into its world without friction, cost, or a narrowing of options. The film montage recounts memories but does not force a trade-off or renunciation. The ticking clock and stilled compasses at the end are presented as gifts from the reel rather than consequences of her agency, undercutting escalation and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (protect collective memory before monsoon) is signaled early but never tightens—Elara encounters the creature, answers correctly on first attempt, and plants the seed without complication. The monsoon arrives in summary and the tree "stands firm" with no dramatized test. No on-page reversal, no live option foreclosed, no visible cost paid. Agency is present (she climbs, answers, plants) but pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (find the color of unspoken apologies) is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs: needle settles, Elias follows it to the cove, discovers letters. The reading aloud and dissolution provide a ritual beat, but agency is minimal—the ocean does the healing, and no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. Coincidence (chest appears exactly where compass points) resolves rather than complicates. No on-page reversal or trade-off; the path is linear and frictionless under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding time and restoring memories) escalates through Elara's agency in the maze, with the halo fragment's warmth and path shifts tightening pressure. Cost is legible at climax with fragment disintegration. Under accumulative lens, escalation is via density increase, but stakes remain internal, limiting higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are tightly escalated through the wall's imminent collapse and enemy pursuit, driven by the liberator's agency under the causal lens. The cost is legible in the frantic escape and the chains' hindrance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of creating safe zones escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's reflections and the symbolic act of placing the bookmark; agency is clear in her decision to abandon fear, with cost legible in the foreclosed path of control.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes around identity escalate through Elara's agency in decrypting notes and using the key, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is visible in the mirror shattering and her resolve. Yet, the betrayal remains off-stage, and the seashell's guidance feels slightly coincidental, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the oracle's agency in retelling stories, deepening the silence and dimming the star under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible as the night intensifies, though the stakes remain internal.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Unit-7's agency in using the violin, driving a deepening under the accumulative lens. The looped timelines narrow options and change knowledge, with cost felt in the protagonist's altered stance. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of relationship mistrust escalates through Elara's agency under an accumulative lens, culminating in her decision to share doodles. Cost is legible in the risk taken, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidences; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (Elias's internal conflict about self-deception and futility) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through his polishing ritual, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. Agency in renunciation forecloses a path with on-page cost in the final realization. Pressure tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is gradual without sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (proving theory vs. station safety) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the system failures and stabilization. The lever pull tightens options meaningfully, though the resolution leans slightly on convenient stability recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of unraveling the code escalates under the accumulative lens through Clara's agency, from finding the program to humming the melody. Cost is legible in her emotional transformation and the ghost's vanishing, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake of internal truth. Cost is unmistakable in Elara's emotional transformation and the smudging action, which narrows options and forecloses paths.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from finding the valve wheel to activating the machine, with cost legible in her facing fears and achieving closure. The dominant stake of truth-seeking tightens meaningfully, though the climax's cost could be more visceral, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of preserving balance escalates through Lira's agency in following the map and gazing into the mirror, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in her mental unraveling and the journals' new entries, foreclosing her previous peace with a felt price under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of fostering wonder escalates through Elara's agency in the shared moment, narrowing Finn's options under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in his abandoned telescope and "newfound curiosity."

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring dreams) and escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from probing the tapestry to performing the ritual. Cost is felt in the energy and weight during the climax, narrowing options meaningfully. No coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of self-discovery escalates through Li Wei's agency, using the specs to decode dreams and plan the journey, narrowing options with visible cost. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens in a meaningful turn, foreclosing the current path. The cost of departure is legible on the page, though the escalation relies slightly on internal realization over external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early and escalate through the priest's agency, with cost legible in the possession's dissolution. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though escalation is more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (completing task before exhaustion) escalates via time pressure under the Accumulative lens, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the writer's collapse, but escalation lacks multiple distinct beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in choosing paths, increasing density and reweighting stakes. Cost is legible in her realization and the tablet's dimming, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing the conquest motive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in using backward songs, tightening the internal stake of overcoming numbness under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes around discovering time's texture escalate through Elias's agency, driven by pattern recognition and mirror visions under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the mirror's images of bound or drifting selves. The final choice narrows options with a felt price, but the escalation lacks one tightening beat for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency, moving from hesitation to playing and storytelling, which reweights the stakes of overcoming the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is Mara's internal conflict with time and creativity, escalating under the accumulative lens through density increases like the shifting canals and pendant's glow. Agency drives escalation—her decision to follow the pull and enter the gate—with cost visible in her transformed understanding. One meaningful tightening suffices, but pressure could be more intense in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes around understanding ambiguous loss escalate through Elara's agency, from decoding patterns to confronting the mentor's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes of visibility versus safety are signaled early and escalate through the dweller's agency in uncovering fragments, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (internal conflict between silence and revelation) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases, e.g., storm intensity and timer rhythm. Agency drives escalation via Elara's decision to open the envelope, narrowing options with cost in emotional clarity. One meaningful tightening occurs, foreclosing the path of censorship. Coincidence is absent; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through dialogue-driven agency under the Accumulative lens, with Mara's shift and Elias's insight showing cost. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the conflict remains abstract, slightly limiting visceral impact.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is essentially spiritual/intellectual—whether Elara can find meaning and a new stance toward decay and change—which is coherent but low-pressure. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with minimal resistance or genuine jeopardy; the dust’s “conscious” behavior never truly threatens or challenges her. Escalation exists (dust reacting, patterns shifting, butterfly appearing) but the price of each step is nearly frictionless. The ending reconfigures her outlook rather than resolving a sharpened dilemma, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high in premise—attempted murder, destroyed workshop, missing apprentice—but current-scene pressure is low and mostly informational. Elara encounters no active opposition or real risk on the trail; she simply discovers things, so escalation reads as a gentle uncovering rather than tightening conflict. The main “turn” is the ledger’s revelation of the mastermind and the apprentice’s survival, which is delivered as summary instead of a hard-earned or contested beat. Her renewed determination at the end feels earned enough, but the path there lacks concrete tests or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to “translate” silence—is clear, but the pressure on that goal remains largely internal and low-intensity. The arrival of Kael and discovery of the pattern constitute the main escalation, yet they come without much prior resistance or risk. Elara’s failures are summarized rather than tested in scene, so commitment is asserted more than proven. The result is a gentle tightening rather than a truly charged or costly turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (letting the city’s dead send a final distress signal and thus finding Elias’s own rest) is clear, but on-page escalation is mild. Once he realizes the lens is incomplete, the search and reassembly proceed without real setbacks, time pressure, or meaningful alternatives. His agency drives events, yet the absence of friction or cost (physical danger, moral dilemma, or real possibility of failure) flattens tension. The climax—the lens’s activation—lands emotionally but not as the endpoint of rising conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central tension—between anonymous aid and the need for visible, communal solidarity—is coherent and does progress from secret runs to public organizing. The accidental discovery and rumor add mild pressure, but there’s no real opposition or hard trade-off on the page; Mara’s shift to public leadership comes without concrete risk or resistance. The gathering proceeds smoothly, and offers of help flow without friction, so escalation feels gentle rather than truly testing. Stakes remain mostly conceptual (identity, unity) rather than viscerally felt in specific jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving neglected love from a past life—is clear, but the story offers almost no resistance or meaningful risk in pursuit of it. Once the spark appears, each step unfolds smoothly, with no real possibility of failure or painful trade-off. Internal conflict (fear vs longing, doubt vs faith) is gestured at but never truly sharpens into a dilemma. As a result, escalation exists structurally but lacks bite, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to the “texture of time” and recovering lost ancestral memory—is clear, and the energy-tightening around the pedestal and disintegration offers a recognizable escalation. Yet there is little sense of risk or meaningful alternative; she never debates using the fragment or confronts the possibility of loss, injury, or madness. The vortex overwhelms but does not exact a visible price beyond exhaustion and the fragment’s consumption, which she never hesitates to pay. As a result, tension is present but muted, more wonder-quest than genuine crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stakes (saving the last seeds before the wall seals them away) are clear and there is a genuine tightening when the enemies arrive and the wall begins to groan. Yet the liberator never faces a hard trade-off—no seeds dropped, no injury, no moral compromise—and the enemies remain abstract obstacles rather than adaptive antagonists. The chase and collapse read more like expected beats than escalating dilemmas. Conflict is coherent and sustained but stops short of a truly costly test.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can bear to retrieve and face the sound of trust breaking—is clear, and the decision to use the forge with an absence she’s actively collected provides one meaningful tightening. Pressure does increase as she moves from abstract searching to an embodied, painful encounter with the sound in her chest. However, resistance is mostly implied; there’s limited sense of alternatives foreclosed or of tactics evolving under duress, so the conflict remains more meditative than actively contested. The cost is felt but not sharply tested against counter-impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira seeking the jar to illuminate her path against the risk of a trap—is signaled, but the danger side never meaningfully bites. Once she decodes and rearranges the flowers, the pressure promptly converts into a recruitment/recognition scene rather than a test that forces trade-offs. Elara’s emotional stake in the soul-fragment jar is asserted, yet she yields it without much struggle, undercutting any sense of sacrifice or moral calculus. Escalation thus feels more like a gentle unveiling than a tightening that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara will truly relinquish her need for control enough to create genuine “safe zones”—is present but remains largely conceptual. Pressure deepens slightly as she interrogates “abandon” and ties the work to her grandmother’s legacy, culminating in the symbolic entombing of the bookmark. Still, there is little active opposition or on-page consequence to resisting that change, so tension feels low and the turn at the end reads as gentle affirmation rather than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reclaim a self beyond the constructed “stunt double” identity—is signaled early and tightened as she deciphers the notes and uncovers the stolen life. There is a credible escalation from unease to revelation to a decisive stance in the mirror room. Yet opposition is soft: the “enemy” never manifests, the puzzle yields with little resistance, and there’s no clear moment where a real option is foreclosed with visible cost. As a result, tension feels more like steady mood than a sharply rising pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—advancing the map of endless night—is present but largely internal and unopposed, so tension remains low-grade throughout. The only tangible “tightening” is the shift to the personal childhood story, which carries more charge but introduces no new risk or alternative path. External pressures (storm, vanishing stars) never really corner the oracle or threaten loss beyond abstraction. The result is a beautifully monotonous pressure curve rather than a true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding where thoughts come from—is clearly stated, and the music/timeline sequence is a recognizable escalation. Yet the pressure never truly tightens: the program’s supposed cost (looped timelines, potential risk) is told but never felt as a dilemma or threat. Unit-7 never faces a real trade-off or live alternative; it simply proceeds and succeeds. As a result, the resolution feels relatively untested and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara risks honesty to mend trust with Kian—is signaled clearly and followed through. The main escalation is her choice to transform private reflection into a concrete gesture (the doodles and the lens) as Kian arrives. However, Kian’s quick, positive acceptance means the tension breaks almost immediately, with little sense of resistance or potential loss. The conflict works, but the pressure curve is soft and fairly predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elias can reframe his sense of futility and relationship to the garden—and it’s coherently signaled. However, escalation is gentle: there’s no distinct pressure spike or reversal, just a soft deepening over “days turned into weeks.” His final stance feels more like a graceful slide than a hard-earned trade-off with a felt price in the moment. The piece works as a lyric character study, but the conflict lacks the tightening or sharp choice that elite venues usually want, even in quiet work.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—risking the station to prove a radical temporal theory—is signaled early and escalates when the nexus destabilizes and systems fail. Elara’s agency clearly drives both the crisis and solution, giving the conflict a coherent throughline. Yet the escalation feels soft: alarms blare, but there’s no real loss, injury, or irreversible damage, and the resolution comes from a quick, competent adjustment without a wrenching trade-off. The tension is present but never truly sharp or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the ghost’s unfinished work and answering Clara’s own longing—is present but faces almost no resistance. Once she notices the patterns and hums, events unfold without significant obstacles, reversals, or true risk of failure. The ghost’s appearance quickly confirms she’s a benevolent guide, removing potential tension. As a result, escalation reads more as steady unveiling than tightening pressure or real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can live with or reframe the burden of this “swallowed truth”—is legible and present early. Pressure tightens via the hallucinated motion of the flower, the painful smudge, and the wanderer’s probing about truth vs shadow. However, escalation remains mostly interior and philosophical; no clear alternative path is dramatically foreclosed, and the emotional price of her final choice (to nurture ambiguity and stay in the margins) is relatively gentle on the page. It’s a coherent but low-intensity conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—truth about her father and the fate of the trapped workers—are clearly signaled and structurally present. Escalation from eerie tunnel to moving shadows and screams provides a basic tightening, but the opposition never truly threatens her or forces a non-obvious trade-off. When the shadows “lunged,” they fail to inflict consequence and do not alter her tactics; she simply continues forward and succeeds on the first attempt. The conflict functions but lacks a sharp, pressured decision point with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stakes are internal—whether Lira remains a distant chronicler or risks dissolution in the refuge’s “regenerative silence”—and this throughline is consistent. Pressure escalates via the swan’s transformation, the arduous journey, and the engulfing mirror, but Lira rarely seems to genuinely consider refusal or alternatives, so the choice points lack teeth. The mirror sequence offers a strong potential cost (unraveling mind, visions of total decay) but this risk is mostly gestured at rather than made viscerally unavoidable. Conflict remains more meditative than tense, which suits the tone but limits narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Finn remains afraid of the “broken” sky or recovers a sense of wonder—is clear and does tighten as the eclipse deepens and the magical glow appears. However, conflict is extremely low-friction: Finn yields quickly to reassurance, there’s no serious resistance or misstep, and Elara’s success feels nearly guaranteed. The result is a pleasant escalation rather than a pressured one, with minimal sense of real price or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the world’s dreams—is enormous, but on the page the conflict is almost frictionless. Elara encounters no opposition, moral dilemma, or time pressure; once she finds the scrolls, the ritual proceeds without complication. The “pressure” reads mainly as conceptual rather than dramatized tension, so escalation is shallow. As a result, the resolution feels granted rather than earned through tested commitment or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict remains largely abstract: Li Wei “feels called” by the lighthouse and “plans their journey,” but nothing meaningfully resists or complicates this desire. There are no genuine trade-offs on the page (job, relationships, danger) and no escalation beyond a shift in mood from dreamy curiosity to determined curiosity. The microdot specs ostensibly raise the stakes by connecting to espionage, but no actual danger, secrecy, or opposition emerges. The result is a meditative pivot rather than a pressured decision under stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are enormous and clearly stated (possession devouring all dimensions), and there is a nominal ticking clock. Yet the opposition never meaningfully pushes back: the possession grows “stronger” but does nothing concrete to counter the priest. The questioning strategy is never tested or endangered—no real reversal, loss, or hard trade-off appears—so escalation feels conceptual rather than tense. As a result, the climax resolves too smoothly for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the symphony before exhaustion—remains mostly internal and abstract, with little concrete pressure beyond time slipping away. There is a single clear escalation when the writer rises to engage the harp, but no genuine reversal or hard test of resolve. Exhaustion is declared as a threat but never forces compromise or a change of tactic before the finale. The cost at the end (collapse) is felt, yet the path there feels almost preordained rather than wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will “conquer” or be lost in the labyrinth of self—is clearly stated but only lightly tested. The darkest potential self appears, but Elara is not forced into a consequential trade-off or irrecoverable choice; she observes, feels discomfort, and moves on. Escalation is more quantitative (more paths, more versions) than qualitative in terms of pressure or cost. The ultimate shift from conquest to embrace is conceptually neat but arrives without a demanding crucible moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can disrupt her emotional numbness—is clear, and her choice to engage in a demanding, strange method provides a solid internal conflict framework. The pressure, however, remains relatively low-friction: her experiment proceeds without real setbacks, moral costs, or serious doubt, and success arrives with little resistance. The “legends” about backward songs hint at danger (enthrallment) but never meaningfully threaten her, so tension stays conceptual rather than visceral. The final cost—having to endure “raw, aching aliveness”—is thematically sound but could be sharpened in on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will leave his safe solitude to face a larger, possibly dangerous crisis—is signaled and resolved, with a clear internal turn at the end. Externally, the stakes gesture toward global catastrophe (“storms… not natural”) and biohazard-style danger, but on-page pressure is mild: he slips past guards and explores an empty compound with minimal friction. The masked scientist’s exposition delivers the core threat rather than Elias having to win or earn crucial knowledge through more contested action. As a result, escalation exists but never quite tightens into a truly costly or harrowing crossroads.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias will continue to protect himself from grief or risk reliving it—is clearly implied early through his “aromatically cautious” life and deepens when he first touches the vial and is transported. Escalation functions as an intensifying series of memories, culminating in Lila’s direct question and the reweighting of his avoidance. His final decision to open the vial and let the scent fill the shop is an earned surrender/endurance blend with emotional cost. Still, pressure remains gentle; the conflict never feels truly knife-edge, and options don’t sharply narrow so much as he finally stops stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will position himself toward time and his past (embodied by the rope)—is present but remains largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does tighten somewhat at the mirror, which stages three options (bound, drifting, uncovering) as a crystallized impossible-choice tableau. However, there’s little prior escalation or real friction pushing him toward a costly decision; he moves through the beats with relative calm. Conflict feels thoughtful and elegant rather than truly testing or cornering him.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can answer or transform the oppressive hush—is present but the pressure is gentle and largely internal. After a brief hesitation, the conflict resolves smoothly once she chooses to play; there’s little resistance, no meaningful reversal, and minimal felt cost. The story reads as a graceful progression rather than an escalating test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elara craft a controlled, non-attaching joy that honors Kael’s half-truth—is clear but remains largely internal and professional. There is one main tightening when she actually dissolves the petal and allows its essence to merge, but there’s no real sense of risk beyond mild emotional cost; failure or success carries little concrete consequence on the page. The static electricity and “transformation is near” language hint at escalating tension without manifesting real opposition. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than pressured, competent but not dynamically escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will act on the mistaken letter and form a meaningful connection—remains almost entirely unopposed. She encounters no resistance in opening someone else’s mail, no social or internal pushback strong enough to feel like a dilemma, and the subsequent correspondence is frictionless. The in-person meeting is framed as a “risk” but plays out without tension or real possibility of harm. As a result, escalation is minimal and the story reads more as a gentle chain of agreeable choices than as conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s hunger for belonging—is clear, and the discovery of Echo’s tag provides a solid inciting jolt. Pressure deepens emotionally as her search opens conversations and connections, but there’s little sense of risk that might cause her to quit, be rejected, or lose something tangible. Escalation is mostly accumulative montage rather than a focused tightening that forecloses options. Echo’s arrival resolves her quest without a hard test of commitment or a visible trade-off at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to repair the “interrupted cadence” of her life and art—is clear, but pressure on that stake barely intensifies. Once she decides to follow the pendant, the path unfolds without real resistance, trade-offs, or reversals; the “giant’s nap” clock never tightens into an urgent constraint. Her agency is mostly following an invitation rather than making fraught decisions under pressure. As a result, escalation and visible cost are underdeveloped for elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can pursue dangerous emotional mathematics without repeating her mentor’s fate—is articulated but not rigorously tested in scene. Escalation exists mainly as accumulating information (code, journal, warning) rather than tightening choices or forcing a trade-off; she never seems genuinely tempted to heed the warning or visibly pay a price. The final turn toward “harmony, not control” reads more like an insight than a pressured decision under fire. As a result, tension is present but mild, and stakes remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—risking the safety of anonymity to become visible to those who need the dweller—is clearly signaled. Yet conflict remains largely conceptual; nothing in the environment pushes back, and no real alternative is dramatized beyond “continue to hide” versus “keep doing exactly what they are already doing.” The uncovering of fragments proceeds smoothly without reversal, complication, or visible price, so escalation is minimal. The ending affirms a stance rather than resolving a sharpened dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will cling to control or surrender to transformation—is clear and internally coherent, and the storm’s intensification provides a visible external correlative. Pressure does escalate from unease about the leaf to a decisive embodied act (pressing it to her chest, then reordering the space), but the costs remain mostly conceptual, described rather than dramatized in specific consequences. Her agency in choosing to “release control” is present but cushioned by lyrical language that softens the sense of real risk. The conflict stays engaging yet somewhat low-voltage for a piece aiming at elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for meaning and purpose in her art—is clear but faces little genuine resistance; once the storm begins, everything unfolds without significant obstacle or dilemma. The “exchange” promises a price, yet on the page it’s essentially a straightforward trade of brooch for book with no felt loss, danger, or moral tension. There is a single escalation beat (discovering the ruin/map and then meeting the old woman), but pressure doesn’t really tighten; options never feel foreclosed. As a result, the ending has conceptual weight but limited dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s crisis of faith in her clairvoyance, but the conflict escalates only mildly: she feels a pull, touches the pearl, and then everything proceeds more as destined initiation than contested journey. There is no genuine risk of refusal or failure once the magic engages, and no price for accepting the role of guardian beyond a stated sense of purpose. As a result, tension remains mostly conceptual and the turns lack bite.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can turn absence into meaning and find a role—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and under-pressured. There is escalation from quiet investigation to supernatural summoning, yet opposition is diffuse (skeptical elders off-page, no immediate risk if she fails or refuses). Her key choice is to sound the valve again, accepting the call, but this occurs without a meaningful alternative or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle for a piece aiming at top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—whether Elara will cling to mapped safety or dare the unmapped—is clear and culminates in her decision to punch the ticket. Escalation is present in the progression from desk mystery to supernatural path to fortress test, but external resistance is negligible and the journey unfolds with little friction. The inner conflict is acknowledged but lightly dramatized; her final courage feels plausible yet too easily won for top-tier tension. The cost of her choice is more conceptual than viscerally present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s inner stance toward the fantastical and her hunger for meaning, but the story rarely forces her into a difficult trade-off or genuine dilemma. Once the tile appears, events unfold without significant resistance—her unease never materially interferes with her actions. The climactic act (transcribing the final sequence) is framed as fulfillment rather than a pressured choice with real downside. Conflict is present but gentle, more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elyr’s willingness to risk cosmic instability to escape existential numbness—is signaled and maintained, with escalation as the mutiny in the dimensions intensifies alongside the storm. His agency does drive the crisis: he chooses to channel the storm through the fragment despite visible resistance from the world. Still, the opposition stays diffuse and largely abstract, and no concrete path is truly foreclosed beyond a general sense of “perilous journey ahead.” The piece has clean build and a visible peak, but the pressure never quite sharpens into a specific, costly dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    The primary stake—keep running via political asylum vs stay and try honesty—is legible, and the confrontation with her father is an appropriate pressure point. Yet escalation is mild: his anger appears, softens quickly, and never forces Clara into a truly costly or risky choice on the page. The ink pot’s “energy” offers a convenient internal nudge rather than pressure that tightens external options. As a result, the resolution feels low-friction for the scale of life change implied.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving and deepening her archive of invented histories—is clear, and the hum’s intensification provides a notional escalation. Still, there is no real threat of loss, no competing demand, and no hard trade-off; Elara’s path never narrows in a way that forces a choice. The hum “calling to her” hints at pressure, but this never sharpens into conflict or cost beyond fatigue. The piece functions as a mood piece more than a story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the wanderer can meaningfully reclaim erased histories and their own humanity—is present but stays mostly internal and low-pressure. There is a mild escalation from solitary scavenging to discovering a systemic archive of vanished people, and then to taking on the mantle of “guardian of the forgotten.” Still, conflict never truly tightens: the wanderer isn’t visibly forced to trade off safety, sanity, or belonging, and there’s no credible threat to their goal beyond abstract neglect. The lack of a concrete test or loss keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can “decode” the riddle versus accept its lived, ephemeral nature—is signaled early and paid off in her final understanding. Pressure escalates modestly through her increasingly urgent playing and the supernatural response (glow, tilting room), which works for a quiet, interior story. However, the conflict never feels truly risky; little is foreclosed, and her myth-busting identity is not meaningfully at odds with her desire in a way that forces a painful trade-off. The result feels contemplative rather than tensely driven.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Luminara will be privatized and culturally erased—is stated early and threads through the piece. Escalation exists (Lira moves from decoding warnings to organizing a citywide artistic protest), but turns are mostly summarized, and Vorin’s resistance feels perfunctory, so options never feel sharply narrowed. The Festival of Lights provides a clear tightening and emotional crest, but there is no concrete loss, sacrifice, or near-failure that bites. Agency is present, yet the path to the hopeful ending feels relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving/documenting the Apollo site before terraforming erases it—is clear, and the message “Outlast the dawn” provides a credible tightening. Yet opposition is soft: the communicator’s beeping and vague deadline don’t force a genuine trade-off beyond “stay a bit longer vs. leave on time.” The final decision to remain through dawn is thematically apt but not framed as carrying a concrete risk (jeopardizing the mission, her job, or safety), so tension never fully crests. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nominal stake—repairing the drone to restore the owner’s trust and, symbolically, the human–technology relationship—is clear but never meaningfully pressured. Elara encounters no setbacks, no time crunch beyond the ambient ship departure, and no real possibility of failure; every step of the repair unfolds smoothly and serenely. As a result, there is no palpable escalation or narrowing of options, and the final activation of the drone feels inevitable rather than earned under pressure. The internal and external conflicts stay largely static, limiting dramatic engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—her quest to find a river’s beginning—is clear, but the on-page pressure is very gentle. Once she steps outside, nature essentially cooperates: the thin ice, vibration, and mist present a straightforward path with no real risk, alternative, or sacrifice. Internal doubt or competing desires never seriously contest her goal. As a result, escalation is more a smooth unveiling than a tightening test of commitment, limiting the feeling of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town—is clear, but there is almost no on-page resistance, risk, or hard trade-off. Elias never faces a credible threat that his project might fail, nor a competing demand that tests his “infinitely patient” resolve. The weeks passing are summarized rather than dramatized as escalating pressure, and the bell’s eventual chiming feels inevitable rather than earned through contested effort. This keeps tension low and limits emotional payoff at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.0)
    Being trapped with limited oxygen is a strong initial stake, but once the vial’s powers are introduced, conflict resolves without a meaningful trade-off or reversal. “Unsnarling” the symbols is declared difficult and transformative yet is not dramatized as a sequence of hard choices, failed attempts, or painful realizations. The external survival pressure fades as soon as her motivation shifts to wonder, so the narrowing of options never fully lands. The ending lacks a concrete price paid in the moment; tension ebbs instead of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    The declared stakes—Elias’s name, the vanished guards, the danger of becoming an “offering”—are strong on paper and interwoven with his inheritance. In practice, escalation is mostly informational: he reads about the cost rather than facing a tangible risk or hard trade-off in scene. The “before they found the bodies” clock and the threat of the lighthouse consuming seekers never force a concrete sacrifice or loss on the page. As a result, his final choice feels relatively low-pressure and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—personal freedom versus obligation to a lifetime-spanning debt and to other betrayed spirits—are clearly signaled and conceptually rich. There is one key tightening when the bead’s awakening summons the chorus of spirits, reframing her debt as collective. However, the on-page pressure never quite forces a hard trade-off; she is not visibly sacrificing something immediate or closing a concrete door in the final move. The result is textured tension but relatively gentle escalation for a piece aiming at elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely abstract—healing a desolate canyon and offering future solace—and remain untested by meaningful resistance. There is no real antagonistic pressure or reversal; the middle does not intensify so much as continue the same process with slightly richer imagery. Elara never faces a moment where her goal is at risk or requires a trade-off. As a result, tension stays low and escalation under the accumulative lens is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering a lost legacy to rebuild faith—is signaled early, but little truly pressures it. The only structural tightening is the discovery of the tomb entrance, which functions more as an expected reveal than a hard-won reversal or trade-off. Elara never has to choose between competing goods, nor pay a concrete price beyond time and effort that we largely skip over in summary. As a result, the story reads as a graceful unveiling rather than a conflict-driven progression.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    The nominal stakes—a letter that must be intercepted before mailing, potentially tied to a hidden society—are strong on paper, but on the page Lyra encounters no genuine resistance. The decoding of chalk and retrieval of the letter proceed without setback, test, or trade-off, so escalation is more informational than pressured. The ticking clock is mentioned yet never bites, and there is no visible price for her success. As a result, tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—control of a cosmic gateway and preservation of the flame—are high in concept but mostly verbalized rather than tested. Tension spikes at the knock and the possibility of danger, then diffuses into an informative conversation and a largely frictionless “working through the night.” There is a meaningful tightening when Elara chooses to trust Lira and commit to synchronizing, but no real pushback or reversal, and the conspiracy remains abstract. The result is a gently rising arc rather than a felt escalation with visible prices.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will confront and transform her unsent regret—is clear and culminates in a meaningful choice to open and read the letter. Pressure does escalate texturally (spirits’ songs, shard’s glow, condensation messages, then the shock of seeing her own handwriting). Yet conflict remains mostly internal and relatively unopposed; she never seriously considers refusing the letter or turning back, so few options are truly narrowed on the page. The result is emotionally coherent but low-friction, limiting the sense of risk or sacrifice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary conflict is internal: whether to bear the emotional and ethical burden of decoding and acting on the child’s plea. Stakes (protecting the memory/location of the reef and honoring the child) are clear but mostly conceptual and not concretely tested on the page. Escalation arrives via each new revelation in the notes, yet there is no sharp dilemma or loss that clearly forecloses an alternative path. The final decision to step into the night with purpose is moving but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—will Lira rediscover her passion or remain numbed—is clear, and the story does move from numbness to engagement. Yet conflict and escalation are largely internal and relatively untested: the film and network appear as gifts rather than things she must earn or fight for, and nothing concrete pushes back against her desire. Her “choice” to engage the network and then paint reads as a gentle slide into inevitability, not a pressured decision with trade-offs. As a result, tension never tightens beyond curiosity and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will give up her “certainty” to awaken the garden and, implicitly, herself—is clear and does tighten when the obsidian-eyed woman makes the condition explicit. Pressure escalates in a straightforward way as the mural animates and figures step out, but Elara’s agreement comes very quickly, with minimal sense of real risk or trade-off. The internal conflict (methodical control vs curiosity) is asserted but not deeply tested through multiple tactics or setbacks. As a result, the resolution reads more like a smooth initiation than a pressured choice with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—protection of the Lexicon under the Thought Tax—is clearly signaled, and the discovery of the seed plus the revelation of infiltration creates a conceptual tightening. In-scene conflict, however, remains relatively mild: the only real moment of suspense (the shifting shadows and approaching figure) is quickly defused by Krane’s friendly reveal. Elias is never forced into a difficult trade-off; accepting Krane’s invitation is consistent with his stated mission and costs nothing on the page. As a result, pressure escalates more in exposition than in dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—whether she can transform her insomnia and pain into enduring beauty—is clear but remains mostly internal and abstract. Pressure accumulates gently rather than sharply; “hours turned into days, and days into weeks” indicates effort, but we never hit a concrete test where quitting or failing feels like a real option. The key “turn” (“one night, as she sang…something shifted”) arrives with little prior escalation or specific jeopardy, so the payoff feels more like a lyrical beat than a hard-won breakthrough. As a result, stakes and cost are present in concept but under-dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names and extinct feelings—is signaled and followed through to a clear outcome. Escalation is modest: the hum of the cracked tube, the pull into the museum, the overwhelming chorus during the song. There is no meaningful counter-force or sharp trade-off; Elara never seriously risks failing, nor must she sacrifice something concrete beyond transient overwhelm and intensified regret. The result is a beautiful ritual rather than a fully pressurized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can repair trust with Kael—is stated early and carries through to the end, with her choosing vulnerability and responsibility. Conflict, however, is primarily internal and largely resolved once she decides to use the inkwell; there is no serious risk that the attempt will fail or that Kael will reject her. The symphony ritual operates more as an inevitable catharsis than a pressured test of her resolve. As a result, escalation feels gentle and the cost of success is relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—village safety vs. scholarly access—is clearly articulated, and the conceptual conflict is strong. Yet on-page pressure is mild: no one confronts Elias directly, there is no scene of refusal or obstruction, and the “risk” remains theoretical. His main act (designing a compromise system) faces no serious hindrance, and we don’t see options meaningfully narrowed or a difficult trade-off enacted beyond a thematic balancing. As a result, conflict feels under-escalated compared to the scale of the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reclaim her songs and move from fabricated histories to a truer self—is present but under-pressured. The only external jolt is the mysterious letter, which she accepts without real resistance or complication. Her mapping intensifies, yet there’s little sense of what she might lose by failing, or of competing imperatives that make her choice costly. The escalation reads more as deepened attention than sharpened conflict, leaving tension relatively low for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elara will cling to her search or accept the cost of a distance she cannot cross—is clear and culminates in her leaving the logbook. Conflict is largely internal and situational: the terrace’s shifts and the resurfacing memory deepen pressure without any external antagonist. There is one primary tightening when the terrace rearranges and pulls her into the childhood memory, forcing her to confront the father’s words. The escalation is effective but remains gentle and conceptually scaled, without a truly wrenching trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Elara’s existential search for belonging under literal crushing pressure—are thematically coherent and escalate from quiet curiosity to a life-or-death need to evacuate. The key decision is whether to flee immediately or re-enter the corridor for a final “dance” with the fireflies, which is a nice internal/external braid. However, the external conflict (collapsing facility) feels underdeveloped: the alarms and weakening domes appear late, and her survival is never truly in doubt on the page. The pressure could use one more concrete complication or cost to avoid reading as mostly contemplative with a lightly sketched disaster wrapper.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding disappearing memory paths, tied to her grandmother’s lost laughter—is clear and emotionally credible. There is one main tightening: shifting from chasing content to focusing on emotion, which unlocks a clearer image. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and low-pressure, with no sharp test or real risk of failure beyond a mild continuation of the status quo. The resolution arrives with relatively little resistance; the sense of price paid or path truly foreclosed is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is almost no real opposition: Elias wants to perform and does; the crowd is receptive; nothing threatens failure. Stakes are largely conceptual (combatting monotony) and are never concretely tested or put at risk during the act. The “climax” is a visual flourish, not a turning point forced by pressure. As a result, tension is low and escalation is more a gentle crescendo than a meaningful tightening with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—risk of existential erasure versus the need to create a forbidden verse—is clearly established and escalates as Lira moves from contemplation to action. Pressure rises effectively with the uncorking of the vial, the first line appearing on her skin, and the approach of the sentinel. However, the external conflict resolves with minimal visible price: the sentinel simply turns away without a clear consequence, making the climax feel more like a brush with danger than a truly narrowing crucible. Internal resolve is solid, but the lack of on-page loss or trade-off keeps stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will translate his private reckonings into something shared “before everything shifts”—is signaled but remains low-key and largely internal. The main tightening comes when the pond’s rings “whisper of change,” nudging him toward the atrium, yet there’s no real resistance, dilemma, or visible price to what he chooses. As a result, tension is gentle and mostly static, with little sense of foreclosed alternatives or escalating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains defined by guilt or can reframe his pain into purpose—is legible and resolves in his final choice to leave the box and walk away differently oriented. The feather’s visions constitute the one meaningful deepening, broadening his private sorrow into a shared human burden. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and low-friction; no contrary impulse seriously threatens his trajectory once the box opens, so escalation is more linear realization than struggle. The resolution is thematically apt but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can “puzzle out new equations for hope” through her ritual—remains largely internal and abstract, with the tide as a gentle, not urgent, opposing force. There is some escalation as the tide rises and her patterns become more complex, but no decisive beat where a real option is foreclosed or a painful trade-off is required. Her adjustments to each wave show commitment, yet the outcome never feels in doubt and the realization arrives without being wrested from genuine resistance. As a result, tension is present but mild and never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—pursuing the walls’ dreams at the risk of self-erasure—exists, but it remains more conceptual than pressurized in scene. The key tightening beats are finding the ominous diary warning and then choosing to use the negative as a key anyway; however, she never seriously considers refusal or displays degradation from listening to the walls. As a result, tension escalates more via atmosphere than via concrete costs or constrained options. The ending resolves without a strong sense that she’s given something up or risked genuine harm beyond an abstract possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—getting the mirrors to accept possibility before the bells—is clear, and the pressure tightens as the mirrors resist and Elara must pour more of her heartbeat into the song. The time constraint and the mirrors’ flickering hesitation provide a credible escalation toward the tolling bells. However, the resistance and her struggle are somewhat summarized rather than dramatized through distinct reversals or tactical shifts. The visible cost at the end is strong, but the path there feels a bit smoothed-over.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are clearly signaled as existential (ending a generations-long war) and personally costly (risk of her ideals finally breaking). There is some escalation—from suspicion to “grueling” talks to Elara’s emotional break and truth-telling—but most of this is summarized rather than dramatized in specific beats or reversals. The leaders’ shift from suspicion to signing reads abrupt; the piece skips any concrete impasses or trade-offs that would make their capitulation feel hard-won. Conflict is conceptually robust yet dramatically under-detailed, blunting tension and the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring an extinct species and partially atoning for ecological harm—is clearly articulated. Yet conflict is largely conceptual; on the page, she walks, recognizes a pattern, and succeeds without credible opposition, moral or practical. There’s no substantive reversal or complication that forces her to pay an immediate price or question the attempt. The result is a meaningful act framed as high stakes but experienced as low-pressure, which blunts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—awakening a complacent city—is clearly signaled, and Elara’s unlocking of the sanctuary directly addresses it. However, the conflict feels largely frictionless: untangling the threads is described as “delicate” and “dangerous,” but no concrete obstacle, failure, or genuine moral trade-off manifests on the page. There’s a single escalation beat as the threads harmonize and the door glows, but no foreclosed option or visible loss beyond implied social upheaval. As a result, tension remains more atmospheric than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how to practice “ethical storytelling” without sliding into manipulation—is legible, but the on-page pressure is quite mild. Because the argument is offstage and no one contests his new approach, escalation is mostly from doubt to reassurance. The “reversal” in his method is a clear turn, yet it costs him little beyond a few hours of reworking puppets and a change in mindset. The moral calculus is gestured at rather than sharpened into a genuine dilemma with competing goods or harms.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract—honoring histories and mourning ecological loss—without being tested by concrete, scene-level obstacles or decisions that close doors. The only “tightening” is the felt unease of the unsettled grotto and the monarchs’ absence, which does not compel Elara into a new or riskier choice than her usual ritual. Her humming and final addition of the monarch wing deepen mood but do not significantly raise cost or conflict. As a result, pressure stays relatively flat despite the evocative language around interruption and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving a lost melody of names—is clear, but pressure on that stake stays abstract and gentle. The main “tightening” is the choice to use the ceremonial rope, yet no alternative path or real risk is dramatized, and the work sequence elides difficulty (“hours turned into days”) rather than showing a meaningful test. Nothing on the page suggests the attempt might fail or harm her, so the outcome feels foregone. As a result, escalation is more atmospheric density than genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the directive to answer the paths/walkers question—is clear, and the storm adds a light time-pressure frame. Still, tension escalates only mildly as the seal glows and symbols “dance”; Foresight never seriously risks failure or reconsideration. The conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no hard trade-offs, reversals, or costs dramatized. The achieved peace at the end feels pleasant but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—accessing cosmic/divine secrets via devotion—is lofty but stays conceptual, with no palpable downside if Kael fails or misinterprets the covenant. There is no real antagonistic pressure or internal irresolution; once he finds the tile, everything unfolds linearly toward success. The “leap of faith” is mentioned, but there is no on-page moment where he seriously considers not leaping or where a competing value exacts a visible price. As a result, tension barely escalates, and the outcome never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—Elara trying to open Kael’s hardened resentment—is clear, but escalation is mild and mostly verbal. Kael’s brief softening then recoil provides a small tightening, yet there’s little sense that anything crucial might be lost if he refuses. His eventual willingness feels more like a gentle persuasion success than a hard-won, conflicted decision with real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—will Elara manage to recreate the sextant and reach the runaway dream—is clear, but opposition and cost remain gentle and largely abstract. The main escalation is the workshop sequence, where breathing with the cosmos and the thickening fog build pressure, yet there’s little sense of risk if she fails beyond disappointment. The threshold moment outside offers a conceptual victory with a fleeting window, but no concrete sacrifice or irreversible trade-off is dramatized. As a result, tension is present and steady rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully mend the broken vow and her sense of failure—is clear, and the “Persist” moment provides a modest tightening. However, conflict remains largely internal and under-opposed; once she commits, the tools all work on first use without setbacks or hard choices. The result is gentle escalation rather than a felt testing of her resolve, keeping tension in a reflective band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s pursuit of forbidden knowledge and what it will make of her—remains mostly internal and abstract. There is little genuine opposition or escalation; the orchard never threatens her, and the “keeper of stories” offers answers rather than pressure. The main tightening is her realization that she’s the heir to this nonlinear inheritance, but this is given rather than won. As a result, tension is muted and the sense of price or foreclosed alternative paths is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    World-scale stakes (“Time is collapsing”) are declared early, but most on-page conflict is resolved quickly and cleanly, with traps and obstacles dispatched in summary. The one major tightening—the guardian’s demand to renegotiate entry—is handled swiftly with minimal sense of threat or potential failure. Elara’s agency is present but rarely forced into a hard trade-off or loss; success feels assured. As a result, tension is conceptually high but experientially modest, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—reaching the garden/recapturing what was lost versus losing herself or forgetting who she is—are articulated, and there is one meaningful escalation as the card’s glow intensifies and the mist-door appears. However, opposition is soft: the ship is eerie but not actively resisting, and Elara faces little external or internal pushback beyond a brief, reflective pause at the threshold. The choice to step through feels emotionally important but not sharply contested on the page, so tension remains relatively low. As a result, the ending reads more as an inevitable progression than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the door and understanding the seal’s meaning—is clear but low-intensity and almost entirely unopposed. Pressure escalates mildly as Elara discovers the rope-symbol connection and reconfigures the braids, but her success feels inevitable and risk-free. There is no meaningful trade-off, danger, or credible possibility of failure on the page. As a result, the climax reads more like a smooth puzzle completion than a tested choice under stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance before the energy beings’ chaos consumes the world—is clearly stated, and there’s a nominal escalation as Lira approaches the seed and the air grows heavier. But most of the conflict is declared rather than dramatized; the beings never appear on the page, and Lira encounters no significant obstacles beyond walking, reading, and singing correctly. The single major turn (activating the bloom) is resolved on the first attempt with almost no risk or sacrifice, so tension never tightens into a true test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the prism to prove pattern and meaning in chaos—is explicit from early on and tightens when the first star-aligned attempt partially works, then deepens with the memory-sacrifice requirement. However, Elara’s internal struggle over that sacrifice is too lightly contested; the decision doesn’t feel agonized or genuinely uncertain, so the price reads more conceptual than viscerally costly. There is one main escalation point (the ritual and sacrifice), which works but could carry sharper conflict between her need for proof and fear of losing self. Tension operates more at the conceptual than gut level.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving and interpreting collective memory—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and unthreatened. The main escalation is the move from measuring shadows to touching the fog wall and receiving intense visions, but there is little sense of risk, dilemma, or cost that might make her hesitate. No option is clearly foreclosed by the ending; the work is “far from over,” yet nothing has become harder or more dangerous. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can Lira spark hope in a despairing community—is clear, but it’s never really tested by concrete obstacles or real risk of failure. Once she begins, her rituals and firework work proceed smoothly, and the crowd responds almost immediately and unanimously. There is a mild escalation from private ritual to public chorus, yet no option is foreclosed or hard trade made. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than dramatic and the victory feels somewhat foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether her tangential method is valid—is declared but faces almost no on-page test; Kael’s disapproval is summarized, and once she reaches the grotto, there is no opposition to her goal. The “pressure” escalates mainly via increasingly elaborate visions, which deepen her understanding but don’t complicate or endanger anything. By the end, her method is affirmed by the magic object rather than earned through any risky choice, so resolution feels foregone and low-cost. The absence of a concrete trade-off or loss keeps conflict from rising above a reflective vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freedom from suffocation versus safety in the bunker—is signaled early and followed consistently, and the inversion hour provides a natural tightening of pressure. Yet in practice, Elara’s climb proceeds with little real resistance or reversal; trellis danger is described but not dramatized through near-falls, time pressure, or a forced trade-off (e.g., between returning in time and reaching the heart). The internal conflict between fear and desire flares but never seriously threatens her decision. The result is emotionally engaging but a bit too smooth to feel fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—Mira finding solace from the city’s noise—is clear but remains low-intensity throughout. The main escalation is the storm glass clouding and then clearing as Elias adjusts their path, with the garden serving as a simple, unchallenged solution. There’s little genuine resistance, trade-off, or visible price; her anxiety unravels quickly once exposed to quiet. The conflict operates more as a smooth therapeutic session than a pressured test of values or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching the stairway and throne before sunrise—is signaled, but opposition is mostly procedural (a puzzle, a climb) rather than truly threatening or narrowing options. The mural deciphering and mechanism sequence provide a mild escalation, yet there’s little sense of failure risk or sacrifice. The ascent itself reads more as a montage than a tightening crucible. As a result, the resolution feels earned in sequence but not hard-won in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—saving the sanctuary from encroaching darkness—is signaled early, escalated by the darkness pressing through cracks, and resolved via Lira’s costly choice to spend the ring and sever a scar. Internal and external pressures intertwine reasonably: her ethic of teaching darkness to breathe adds a moral dimension to the act of sealing the threshold. Still, the conflict unfolds in a single, smooth line: no significant reversal tests her commitment or forces a new tactic beyond “draw strength, use relic, endure.” The cost is clear but the path to paying it feels relatively unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The nominal stake—translating pressure into diamonds to “rebuild what was lost”—is intriguing but stays abstract and untested on the page. Once she agrees to follow the cryptic message, everything unfolds without real resistance, moral dilemma, or meaningful trade-off. The chamber’s pressure is noted but not truly perilous or consequential beyond enabling the transformation. As a result, escalation is more a steady progression of wonders than tightening conflict, and the ending’s hope costs Elara nothing visible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the cause of her family’s downfall—is clearly signaled, but the pressure on that stake scarcely escalates. Once she decides to use the gramophone, there is no serious obstacle or complicating reversal; the shadowed figure simply hands over the journal containing every crucial answer. Internal conflict (e.g., fear of what she might learn or ambivalence about ending vs. reviving the dynasty) is implied but not dramatized as a genuine trade-off. As a result, the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than hard-won, with limited sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Alaric will remain a passive “puppet” of his past or align himself with possibility—is present and conceptually interesting. Pressure escalates somewhat as the vines animate, the program vibrates, and he experiences the unsettling vision of himself as a puppet. However, the conflict remains largely internal and unopposed; he doesn’t seriously contemplate refusal, and no competing value or fear pushes back on his emerging allegiance. The result is a graceful deepening rather than a felt test of commitment with a clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking meaning and human connection through this discovered history—is present but remains low-pressure and largely internal. There is one main tightening: her curiosity shifts into a commitment to write the story for Liam and for herself. However, she faces no real obstacle, counterforce, or moral trade-off; nothing seriously threatens her goal or demands sacrifice beyond mild emotional exposure. The conflict thus reads as quietly reflective rather than tense or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing suppressed truth before capture—is legible early, and pressure escalates through physical risk (wading into the lagoon, entering the archive, enforcers arriving) and time constraints during the broadcast. The key tightening is Mara’s forced adaptation when footsteps sound above, leading her to sacrifice stealth for a mass transmission. However, the enforcers’ threat never quite bites on the page—they arrive just after the decisive act, and the physical or emotional cost remains relatively low-res. Conflict is coherent and functional but not maximally harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing doom by silencing a coded prophecy—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure technically increases as the grotto brightens and the atrium spins, but the conflict is largely one-sided endurance with no real reversals or new complications. The prophecy softening and dissolving happens without much resistance or visible risk, muting tension. His agency resolves the problem, but without a hard trade-off or narrowed options at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict and stakes remain very soft throughout; Elara is chosen and affirmed rather than genuinely tested. The primary tension is internal (will she embrace this calling?), but her acceptance is almost immediate and unopposed. The revelation that the speck is a “key” does not force a tradeoff or sacrifice, and no concrete threat or alternative path is dramatized. As a result, escalation is more informational than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—how the tinkerer relates to time and uncertainty—but it stays low-pressure and largely untested. Escalation is geographic and atmospheric rather than truly conflictual; there’s no real obstacle resisting him once he decides to follow the compass. The key “choice” moments (to improvise, to leave the map, to change his craft) come easily and without visible sacrifice. As a result, the story reads more as a guided revelation than as conflict-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will confront her fear and engage with the coin’s mysterious burden—is clear, and there is one meaningful escalation when she chooses to step into the furnace and endure its visions. However, the pressure remains mostly internal and contemplative, with little sense that real harm or irrevocable loss might result from success or failure. The coin’s and foundry’s threat is more implied than felt; once she enters the furnace, events move smoothly toward insight without serious complication or reversal. As a result, the conflict is engaging but relatively low-intensity for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can help this soul release its grief—is clear, but the pressure never tightens much once she arrives. The “pursuit” is mostly prelude; the figure yields to conversation quickly, and there’s little sense she might fail or pay a serious price. Conflict is resolved smoothly without a significant reversal or narrowing of options beyond the expected confession arc. This keeps the piece emotionally pleasant but not truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reframe her trauma into a “mathematics of mercy” and release the strap—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. Pressure rises only gently (heavier air, more intense light, a sensed “presence”), without forcing a hard trade-off or a risky choice. The climactic act of letting the strap fall into the stream is symbolically important but comes without fierce resistance or visible cost beyond the stated “strange sense of release.” The conflict feels sincere yet under-escalated for the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming and honoring buried histories—is signaled early and followed through, but remains largely conceptual. Once Lila finds the spiral symbol, the path to the tower and murals unfolds without real resistance, danger, or trade-off. There is no moment where she must choose between competing goods, incur a loss, or risk failure beyond a generalized sense of “weight.” The escalation is mild discovery rather than genuine tightening, leaving tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—helping the trapped ghosts and, secondarily, relieving Marcus’s own haunting sense of purpose—is intelligible, and there is a discernible tightening as whispers grow, cracks appear, and he climbs into the ceiling. However, the conflict remains mostly atmospheric; events unfold with minimal resistance, danger, or difficult trade-offs, and his agency is never truly tested against a live alternative or cost. The “engage” whisper prompts action, but no beat forces a hard choice between competing values or risks. Tension exists, but it never quite escalates to a level that would feel crucial or fraught in a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely abstract—understanding patterns, compressing eternity, discovering a greater system—and are never forced into a painful trade-off or concrete risk. Elara encounters no meaningful resistance: the rupture yields the bottle, the clouds cradle rather than threaten, and the new library reveals itself without demanding sacrifice. Her decision to step off the platform is the one real leap, but it lands into safety almost immediately, softening its bite. As a result, pressure doesn’t truly escalate; the piece reads as an initiation vision rather than a conflict-tested journey.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving temporal plasticity and reclaiming credibility—is signaled clearly and pays off, but escalation is muted by how easily Elara accesses the sealed Hall and completes the ritual with no on-page obstacle. The conflict between Empiricists and Visionaries frames ideological tension without becoming active scene pressure during the storm; it’s largely resolved after the fact when they “are forced to concede.” Internal and external stakes intersect at the vision moment, where her personal ache and the civilization’s loss collide, yet she is never forced into a painful trade-off or near-failure. The result is emotionally affecting but short of fully pressurized conflict for this tier of venue.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes are high (time’s balance, stolen midnight light), and the box/tether give Elias a clear task, but on-page pressure is low. There are no real setbacks, competing demands, or hard trade-offs; once Elias decides to go, the path to success is linear. The key choice—freeing rather than “repairing” the box—is conceptually framed but not dramatized as a difficult gamble with meaningful risk. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling of spectacle than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will reach and confront the uncanny lagoon—is clear, but external and internal pressure stay low, with minimal genuine risk or opposition. The main tightening is the descent itself and the revelation that the lagoon is a gateway, followed by the “choice” not to retrieve the dropped compass, which reads more as acceptance than a hard trade-off. Her goal is never seriously in doubt, and no alternative path tempts her. The story functions more as a reverie than a conflict-driven narrative, which limits stakes despite a strong central image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    The primary stake—uncovering the slide’s meaning and purpose—is clear, and there is a mild escalation as Mara moves from exposed storm to hidden chamber to blinding revelation. Yet opposition is nearly absent: the storm pauses conveniently, the passage opens readily, and nothing seriously threatens her goal or forces a trade-off. Internal conflict is gestured at (fear vs. exhilaration) but never truly complicates her choices. The result is a gently rising curve rather than a gripping test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can she authentically capture the dreamed cathedral and answer her lifelong question?—is clear but remains largely internal and unopposed. Her decision to travel and the long hours of work offer a mild deepening of commitment, yet there’s no meaningful resistance, reversal, or difficult trade-off. Escalation is more a steady accumulation of reverent observation than tightening pressure. The final stance crystallizes, but without a palpable sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth and honoring erased histories—is clearly signaled, and there is some internal pressure as doubt creeps in while she waits. Yet escalation is minimal: once the entity appears, it offers no real resistance, and the negotiation is resolved with a nod and disappearance, with no trade-off or test of resolve. The risk to Elara (personal, moral, or physical) is barely articulated beyond generic trepidation. As a result, the parley moment reads more like a threshold crossed than a hard-won, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town in a non-nostalgic way—is clearly stated but only lightly pressured. Once Elara begins to conceive, the revival unfolds without obstacle, sacrifice, or meaningful risk, and no alternative path truly tempts her in-scene. The “false comfort of nostalgia” is conceptually interesting but never dramatized as a live option she must wrestle down. As a result, escalation is modest and cost remains mostly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the garden “remembers” and what that means for Elara’s work—is clear but largely internal and low-risk. The prophecy and the silent foghorn provide an inciting pressure, and the deciphering of the tree symbols is a genuine deepening of knowledge. Still, there’s no strong sense of what might be lost if she fails or refuses; no moral or emotional tradeoff is forced on her. Escalation remains gentle, so the final “I remember” feels like affirmation more than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared as potentially world-destroying or world-restoring, but on the page, nothing opposes Elara—no real risk of failure or meaningful alternative path appears. The main “turn” is simply her decision to step through the vortex, which is framed as almost immediately reassuring (“as if the universe itself were welcoming her”). Internal conflict is gestured at via “fury” and “tranquility” but never forces a painful trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very soft: curiosity versus uncertainty in the face of an anomaly, with no real threat or counterforce. The main tightening is the shift from passive sensing to active rope-pulling, then from first tug to committed second tug. There’s no clear foreclosed option or meaningful price for proceeding—the story never convinces us he might truly refuse or regret this act. As a result, stakes feel largely conceptual rather than viscerally pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, centered on whether and how Lira will open herself to what the lantern offers. The “escalation” is a gentle deepening—curiosity → following coordinates → spiritual insight—rather than any real narrowing of options or competing pressures. There is no counterforce, risk, or meaningful trade-off beyond accepting a new frame for her work. The quiet mode is fine, but the stakes remain abstract enough that tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can restore the broken covenant and free the ghosts—is clear but remains mostly abstract and unopposed. Pressure rises in a soft, accumulative way (from discovery to ritual), yet there are no real setbacks, conflicting desires, or hard trade-offs; every step works on the first try. The ritual scene hints at weight (“pressing down like a physical force”) but doesn’t force Elias to risk anything or choose between competing goods. As a result, the story resolves without a felt price, muting its emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—time itself destabilizing—is strong in concept but reads abstractly on the page; we never see concrete consequences beyond the chronometer flickering. Conflict escalates in a single clean line from malfunction to discovery to successful repair, with no meaningful setback, opposition, or risk to Elara beyond mild uncertainty. Thaddeus’s arrival solves the interpretive problem almost immediately. As a result, the climax (activating the device) feels low-risk and underpriced for the scale of what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is the wanderer’s lost capacity to “see beauty in the incomplete,” with a secondary stake in the tentative bond between them. The kite’s fall supplies an inciting disturbance, and there is one meaningful deepening when they choose to collaborate on the repair. Yet there’s virtually no resistance—internal or external—to impede their progress or to test how much either is willing to risk emotionally. As a result, escalation feels gentle and the price of the resolution stays modest and somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—what Elias can accomplish in his last months and the legacy of interspecies respect he hopes to leave—are clear but under-pressurized. There are no real obstacles, reversals, or sharp trade-offs; the orchard and its secrets yield to his efforts without resistance. As a result, escalation reads more as gentle accumulation than tightening conflict, with no moment where he must sacrifice one good for another. The cost is primarily offstage (his impending death) rather than dramatized through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand “the chemistry of homecoming” and reconcile skepticism with the pull of pilgrimage—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-intensity. Pressure does accumulate in a quiet, contemplative way as she climbs, meets the pilgrim, and confronts the larger amber. However, there’s no real test that forces a trade-off or loss; her shift to “quiet awe” feels more granted than hard-won. The conflict is thoughtful but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the coachman can meaningfully mend a wounded land—is present but remains mostly abstract. Planting the seeds constitutes a quiet assertion of agency, yet there is no counterforce, risk, or real friction beyond the enormity of the task. The escalation is gentle: twilight deepens, flowers respond, he feels a “spark of something new,” but no option is foreclosed or meaningfully tested. As a result, tension sits at a low hum; the piece works as a contemplative vignette rather than a story with sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Elias will re-open himself to mystery and connection, but this remains mostly abstract and low-risk. The investigation into the riddle lacks reversals or meaningful obstacles; the machine works on first try and nothing materially opposes him. The emotional stakes (solitude vs. connection) are gestured at but never put into true tension where a trade-off must be felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can turn confusion into exploration by embracing her gift—remains largely internal and unopposed, with minimal escalation. There is no tangible antagonist, deadline, or concrete dilemma; the pressure is constant but static, so the middle of the story reads as reiteration rather than tightening. Her eventual resolve is framed as a realization rather than the culmination of tested, conflicting desires. As a result, tension exists conceptually but not viscerally, holding this below strong-publication level for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—fixing the corrupted sky—is named early and pursued straight through to the end. The chess game provides a nominal tightening, but we get no reversals, near-failures, or concrete consequences for mistakes, so tension stays abstract. The final “reveal” that the lid is a key, not a tool, doesn’t introduce real dilemma or loss; it simply unlocks success. Conflict functions but never feels genuinely costly or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to unbind from performed roles and find something “real”—is clear, and Kael’s invitation to walk provides a genuine turning point. Yet pressure never truly tightens; her assent to the ritual is easy, with no serious risk, doubt, or competing desire on the page. The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with minimal sense of what she might lose by changing. As a result, the ending reads more like a graceful shift than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will face the pain of memory to reclaim her buried talents and sense of home—is established early and paid off. There is some escalation via the charged air, gathering “hidden thunder,” and the bookstore’s shifting geometry, but these pressures never actually threaten her or present a genuine alternative path. Her key choice (to use the stone and confront the memory of the feather) succeeds on the first try without setback, sacrifice, or cost beyond what’s summarized. The result is conflict that is conceptually clear but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully reframe her guilt—is signaled early and returns at the end, but faces little real on-page resistance. The decoding of the tapestry, the entrance into the labyrinth, and finding the platinum thread all proceed without missteps, trade-offs, or tests of resolve; each obstacle yields immediately to her competence. As a result, escalation feels more like a sequence of symbolic stations than tightening pressure, and there is no moment where she must choose between competing costs. The emotional price is primarily narrated rather than dramatized in a charged decision under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can find a version of forgiveness she can bear—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates credibly as the spire awakens, the echoes multiply, and shadows of those involved in her harms appear, culminating in the realization that forgiveness requires surrendering a piece of herself. The elders’ warnings and the impending ritual add declared but mostly ambient tension rather than concrete obstacles, so external pressure feels underexploited. Still, the internal conflict tightens enough to make her final acceptance read as a costly, active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes (salvaging memory/meaning under the literal and metaphorical threat of dissolution) are clear, and pressure does escalate when the statue activates and the workshop lurches toward possible destruction. Elara’s agency in aligning the charm and then narrating through the chaos drives the key turns. Yet the resolution feels low-friction: her declaration alone calms both workshop and sea, with no evident sacrifice or narrowed future options. The conflict functions but doesn’t achieve a sharp sense of irreversible cost or truly tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will risk revealing her “deepest truth” and fulfilling her promise—exists but remains abstract and gently pressured. The only external complication is the boulder detour, which conveniently delivers the oasis rather than testing her resolve. Once she chooses to paint, nothing contests or complicates that choice; there’s no genuine trade-off or loss on the page. As a result, escalation is modest and the final stance feels earned in logic but not in hard-won struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desire to validate the power of quiet intent over overt assertion—is clear but remains largely interior and abstract. There is some escalation as the cork’s pull intensifies and a mysterious figure appears, but opposition is minimal and Elias never seriously risks anything tangible (job, relationships, safety) to pursue his goal. The beckoning and subsequent following are turning points, yet they unfold without real doubt or pushback. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—calling back the lost and transforming the station from prison to refuge—is clear, and the repeated phone calls provide an inciting pressure. However, conflict is mostly implied rather than enacted; Mara’s work is “grueling,” but she encounters no serious setbacks, alternatives, or moral tensions that force a hard trade-off. The device’s success comes almost immediately upon completion, and the arrival of travelers reads as a straightforward payoff rather than a test. The final cyclical reminder (waning moon) hints at ongoing struggle but doesn’t land as a concrete price in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main stake—Elias’s psychological and practical safety under the compulsion to speak truth—is coherent and signaled early, and the eye’s curse offers a solid inciting turn. Escalation is modest: once Mara identifies the object and the ritual, the path to resolution feels relatively unthreatened, with little sense that failure or delay would carry a sharper cost. Internal conflict (fear of keeping vs. fear of leaving the eye) is intriguing but resolved quickly in favor of action without further complications testing that choice. The ritual itself proceeds smoothly, so the peak never quite sharpens into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to understand and honor the stranger’s final “Remember”—is clear but remains largely internal and low-voltage. There is a mild escalation from vague unease to concrete signs (footprint, journal) and then to a reframed responsibility, but no moment where he must truly trade one good for another or face a visible loss. The ending choice to “keep them safe” reads as an extension of his nature rather than a pressured decision. As a result, tension is steady and gentle rather than tightening meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes stay abstract: balance of the world, Elias’s vague purposelessness, but nothing on the page threatens him or forces a real trade-off. Every step (touching the wall, stepping through the arch, accepting the role) is taken without fear, doubt, or competing desire. The “doorway of decisions” premise promises moral or existential tension that never materializes in a scene-level dilemma. As a result, escalation is more about increasing wonder than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and responding to the dreams and the world’s imbalance—is clear, but on-page pressure is soft. The queen encounters little resistance: the climb is described as effortful but not genuinely perilous, and the revelation scene offers information rather than a hard choice with competing costs. The supposed danger of the grotto and the advisors’ warnings never materialize as concrete, escalating obstacles. As a result, the final commitment feels more like an informed acceptance than a pressured, high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can “revalue” the moment and anchor presence—is stated early, and the ritual provides a nominal escalation beat. Nonetheless, there is minimal resistance or uncertainty: no risk of failure, backlash, or moral tension, and Kael’s acceptance comes almost immediately. The ritual unfolds smoothly without any reversal or real narrowing of options, so tension stays low. As a result, the closure is emotionally pleasant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reframe her relationship to her past selves and regain narrative agency—is clear from early on. Pressure does deepen as her envy and confusion are explicated and then confronted in the dream sequence, where the chorus of past selves poses the central question. However, escalation stays relatively gentle, with little sense of real risk that she might fail, and obstacles are largely summarized rather than sharply tested on the page. The epiphany lands but feels somewhat unopposed, keeping the conflict from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find meaning and connection despite her loss—is present but remains largely internal and low-pressure. There is a gentle tightening when Mira returns and reveals the screw’s history, which prompts Elara’s revaluation. However, Elara never faces a genuinely difficult choice or a trade-off; nothing is at risk of being lost if she fails to “read” the object. The result is moving but somewhat static in terms of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can face the storm without succumbing to old fears—is clear from early on. Conflict escalates credibly when the rain starts and the quill crystallizes, and her choice to lean into superstition as grounding is a meaningful internal move. Yet the pressure never feels genuinely tight; there’s little sense of what failure would concretely cost beyond transient distress. The resolution arrives quickly once she focuses on her heartbeat, so the arc reads more like a well-executed exercise than a truly fraught test.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—reconciling with her grandmother’s memory and facing the orchard’s impending destruction—are clear and emotionally legible. There is one meaningful deepening when the apology becomes an energetic act and her grandmother appears, which narrows her emotional options toward acceptance. However, external pressure stays static: the trees’ fate is foregone, and no one or nothing opposes her ritual or apology. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-friction escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions to achieve unity—is clearly stated but remains abstract and unresisted. There is a nominal escalation from walking the aisles to confronting the mural to dissolving illusions, yet no meaningful opposition or trade-off sharpens these moves. The illusions part “on command” once the witness closes their eyes; nothing fights back, and no real option is foreclosed. The climax functions as a culmination of setup rather than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to understand the true nature of time—is signaled early, and there is one clear tightening when he discovers and uses the hidden slot. Yet pressure remains extremely low; nothing meaningful is at risk beyond a mildly abstract existential itch, and no option is visibly foreclosed by his realization. Counting backwards and the key-drop flirt with ritualistic escalation but don’t translate into felt jeopardy or cost. As a result, closure reads as an untroubled insight rather than the endpoint of real conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (protecting against unauthorized entry) is established early, and there is some initial tension in following unknown, non-human footprints. Once the figure appears, however, conflict flattens into a calm, didactic conversation with little escalation or credible threat. Elara’s “choice” to accept the mushroom and new worldview faces no real competing imperative—her job, fear, or loyalty to protocol never truly bite. As a result, pressure feels conceptual rather than lived, and no path is convincingly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central conflict is almost entirely internal—how to relate to her father’s contradictions and legacy—and that stake is clear but stays abstract. Pressure does not significantly escalate; we move from contemplation to a calmer, more resolved contemplation without a sharp tightening. Her choice to begin writing is meaningful but not clearly framed as a trade-off or a path that forecloses alternatives. As a result, the story reads as reflective mood rather than a pressured decision under escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Eli’s choice between safe estrangement and risky connection—emerges clearly and tightens as the calls grow stranger and more insistent. The escalation from odd wrong numbers to a near-overwhelming chorus of voices seeking endings provides a credible pressure arc. His final act of calling someone from his past is an earned resolution, but the cost (what he risks losing) remains largely implied rather than sharply dramatized. Conflict stays mostly internal and atmospheric, never quite reaching a knife-edge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the locket’s story and the covenant will be preserved—is signaled, but it never faces real resistance. Elara encounters no obstacle in pursuing her goal: Mara readily confirms the backstory, and there is no countervailing desire or threat to the jetty on the page. Escalation is thus mostly informational, not pressure-driven, and the final recommitment lacks a visible price. The conflict feels meditative rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to address a pervasive loneliness—is clearly signaled, and the discovery/activation of the clock is a real turn. But conflict is almost entirely internal and largely uncontested; she encounters no obstacles, doubts, or competing desires once she enters the station. The clock’s reward of insight comes without price or resistance, so escalation is more like a smooth unveiling than a pressured narrowing of options. This keeps tension gentle and reflective rather than urgent or gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—mapping her own emotional landscape—is stated clearly, but on-page pressure remains very gentle. Once the call appears, Elara follows it without facing real alternatives, reversals, or hard trade-offs; the path is essentially unimpeded. The main escalation is tonal (notes growing louder, the pool’s intensity) rather than conflictual, and the realization at the end doesn’t visibly foreclose another path or show a price paid. This keeps the piece in the realm of meditative vignette rather than fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and resolving the anomaly by “unbending” the timeline—is signaled early and resolved by the end. Escalation is modest: the hum and void’s shift raise pressure slightly, but once she steps in, opposition evaporates and the pen simply activates and guides her hand. There’s no real reversal or tough trade-off; her agency is present but not challenged, and success comes without visible price. The result is a gentle deepening rather than a truly tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking a new form of power/voice in a world that has forgotten her—is signaled early but remains mostly internal and abstract. The only concrete turn is the camera’s unexpected click, which slightly heightens pressure by confirming that her actions have invisible consequence. However, there’s limited escalation: her tactics don’t really change, risks don’t increase, and no real option is foreclosed beyond a quiet commitment to this mode of expression. The result is a gentle, almost static conflict curve rather than a tightening one.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the forgotten promise—is clear from early on, but pressure barely escalates; each new piece of art simply yields the next clue without real resistance or meaningful risk. There’s no concrete antagonist or environmental hazard, and no moment where a genuine option is foreclosed or sacrifice is demanded. The internal conflict remains muted; the arsonist never has to choose between burning and preserving, or between personal need and the civilization’s legacy. As a result, the resolution feels earned but low-tension, more contemplative than actively hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s altered mind will remain a curse or become a purposeful connection—is signaled, and it does resolve. Escalation is mainly accumulative/textural: the lagoon’s ripples and hum build to her vision of shared memories, but she never faces a concrete risk, opposition, or difficult trade-off on the page. The off-stage scientists aren’t exerting real-time pressure, and nothing tangible threatens her if she misuses or rejects this “gift.” The ending choice feels positive and low-cost, muting tension even as it provides a clear new direction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    There is a clear conflict—Eli versus the resistant labyrinth and the challenge embodied by Mira—and a recognizable turning point at the wall with the lock. The stakes, however, are largely abstract (proving a point about whispers, reaching a rumored center) and never materialize into a concrete risk of loss or harm on the page. The labyrinth “seems” to resist and the storm “intensifies,” but nothing forces Eli into a painful trade-off or true jeopardy; the key choice is tense in concept but too easily executed in practice. As a result, escalation is present but muted, and the resolution doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the stranger can unburden their darkness enough to feel any hope—is clear but remains abstract. Pressure does mildly increase as silence stretches into confession, yet there is no real risk of refusal or backlash; the guardian’s success feels guaranteed. The confessional beat functions more as a release valve than a test, and we see no significant price for speaking or listening. As a result, escalation is present but muted, and the final relief comes cheaply.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    The declared stakes—a “humble rebellion” against unreflective living—never meet meaningful resistance on the page. Organizing the displays proceeds smoothly; no one doubts, obstructs, or misinterprets his efforts. Internal conflict is similarly low: he never wavers or sacrifices something tangible to pursue his mission. As a result, tension remains conceptual and static rather than escalating toward a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk dismantling her defenses to claim a more authentic freedom—is clear and culminates in the choice to let go of the scrimshaw and her constructed self. Escalation exists (ordinary dock life → uncanny relic → summoned island → barrier/heart) but remains relatively smooth, with few hard pressures or reversals that force her to seriously consider not changing. The cost of change is gestured at conceptually rather than made viscerally fraught on the page, so conflict feels more contemplative than sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can maintain an authentic relationship with her grief under a happiness mandate—is clear but remains largely internal and static. Pressure comes from the world’s rules and her brother’s memory, yet there’s no concrete threat or immediate consequence on the page to tighten her options. The closest to escalation is the shift from numb routine to a more deliberate, resistive framing of her whittling and the carved heart. As a result, tension simmers rather than sharpens, and the ending reads as a modest crystallization rather than a tested choice under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet will truly cross “sacred” boundaries and let their art become a transformative conduit—is signaled early and thematically reinforced. Yet opposition is almost entirely absent; the world welcomes the poet, and there is no real risk of failure or reversal, only successful deepening. The closest thing to a cost is the dissolving of self-boundaries, but this is framed as purely uplifting, without genuine ambivalence or sacrifice on the page. As a result, tension remains low and escalation feels contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to reconcile his colorblindness with his vocation and find a valid artistic mode; it is clear but treated with great gentleness. Pressure escalates modestly when the concertina unexpectedly responds and he actively engineers a barter with the spirits via plant-music, leading to a peak of music and responsive plants. However, there is little sense of what he risks losing—no serious alternative path is foreclosed, and no sharp trade-off is dramatized. The resolution feels more like a graceful alignment than a conflict truly tested under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—whether Elara can rediscover/restore a sense of connection through lost sounds—is conceptually present but never feels truly at risk. The sequence of sounds offers escalation in breadth (child’s laughter, factory hum, duality of progress) but not in tension or cost; Elara is never forced into a trade-off or threatened loss. Her final renewed purpose is earned conceptually, yet it arrives without a crystallizing moment of genuine jeopardy or sacrifice. This keeps the piece closer to reflective vignette than fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s ability to move from paralysis in grief to re-engagement with purpose, and that conflict is clear from early on. However, escalation is mostly accumulative; the curtains’ activation arrives as an external, almost benevolent intervention rather than something she struggles her way toward. Her major choice—accepting the tattoo—is important but not contested on the page with much resistance or visible risk. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-pressure, keeping the stakes from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering whether the crash was engineered and what that implies—is clear, and Mira’s confession functions as a solid inciting pressure. There is some deepening as Elara moves from seeing a market failure to sensing a deliberate restructuring of society, but opposition is entirely offstage and nothing pushes back on their investigation in the moment. Tension remains mostly abstract and intellectual, with no real narrowing of options or loss beyond time and exhaustion. As a result, escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—risking sanity/innocence in pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is clearly stated but not rigorously tested on the page. Once she notices the erased pattern and speaks the word, the pagoda’s response comes with little resistance, failure risk, or real narrowing of options. The internal tension exists but remains relatively abstract; no concrete loss or irreversible trade-off is dramatized at the peak. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth reveal than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary conflict is internal and conceptual: what the shadow is and how to respond to it once it steps off the screen. There is a clear escalation when the shadow manifests in the room and floods her with sorrow, forcing a choice between destruction, flight, or transformation. However, the stakes remain abstract and largely unpressured by concrete consequences—there’s little sense of what is materially at risk if she fails or errs. Her decision to metamorphose the shadow feels right but relatively untested by competing demands or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will stay defined by betrayal or reconstruct a viable, self-respecting yet compassionate stance—is clear but lightly pressured. The conflict remains largely internal and retrospective; we’re told her conviction was shattered, yet on the page her struggle is smooth, with little real resistance or threat of a darker choice. Escalation is modest: the main “tightening” is the shift from hurt to purposeful tool-arranging and talisman-reframing. The ending’s choice to transform the tail tip and move forward is coherent but lacks a strong sense of cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need for closure and self-knowledge—is clear, but on-page pressure is mild. Once she decides to follow the tunnel, nothing truly threatens her, contradicts her, or forces a painful trade-off; the visions are more illustrative than destabilizing. The reunion of the hourglasses happens as a foregone conclusion rather than an earned outcome tested by resistance. Escalation exists (tower → tunnel visions → glowing cavern), but it’s more scenic than conflict-driven, leaving stakes feeling abstract and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering where unused love is stored—is signaled early and followed through to a conceptual answer. Conflict is largely internal and contemplative; the pressure point is her decision whether to leave the film or take on its burden, which does create a modest tightening. Still, stakes remain abstract and are never tested against a concrete opposing force (time, danger, other people, self-sabotage), so tension plateaus rather than escalating. The absence of a visible price for taking the strip keeps the final choice from feeling fully costly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring vibrancy to a fading village by reclaiming stardust—is abstract and never concretely pressured or opposed. Conflict remains almost entirely internal and atmospheric, without a visible test, trade-off, or reversal. The main “escalation” is the aurora’s song swelling and the archway glowing, which deepens mood but does not force a new stance or cost. As a result, tension stays low and essentially static.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving and preserving the divergent archive—is clear and does intensify briefly when Mara discovers it is dying. However, virtually all escalation is declarative: she learns the archive is failing and then fixes it on the first try via the clock, with no real resistance or trade-off. Her agency is present but not tested; there is no moment where she risks losing the archive or paying a visible price. The ending’s expanded “role” reads more as bestowed purpose than hard-won outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Eamon’s need for insight/meaning—is signaled clearly, but the on-page pressure around it remains low and largely internal. His key actions (following the wind’s song, inserting the gear) face little resistance or real risk, so escalation feels like a smooth ramp rather than a tightening. There’s no moment where a serious alternative or trade-off is dramatized; he essentially glides into enlightenment. The conflict is functional but muted, limiting emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will move from paralysis into active courage—is clear, but escalation is gentle and largely unopposed. The traverse itself never truly threatens or challenges her; there are no meaningful setbacks, alternatives, or visible prices paid beyond effort and time. The climactic “Now, use it” moment is conceptually strong but not sharpened by a tough trade-off on the page. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain deadening “safety” or accept the burden of disruptive truth—is clear and sharpened by the revelation in the cobalt chamber. Escalation arises from discovery rather than opposition: the stain, the hidden door, the vision, and finally Elias’s choice to play. Internal conflict is present but underplayed; he moves from realization to resolution with little resistance or visible cost beyond a generalized weight of knowledge. The result is thematically coherent but emotionally low-tension for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—expose the pretender’s lies and free the kingdom—is clearly stated and the message duel provides a nice, if summarized, escalation. Still, most of the conflict happens in exposition rather than dramatized beats; we’re told the pretender’s annotations grow “frantic” rather than feeling that pressure in scene. The final confrontation resolves too quickly: the pretender collapses at a dropped pellet without any real dilemma or countermove. As a result, the cost of victory and the danger of failure both remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is essentially epistemic and thematic—Elara’s need to understand the significance of the page and the disappearing “paths.” There is some escalation from mild curiosity to obsessive assembly of clues, but the pressure remains low and largely internal, without a real trade-off or narrowed option set. No choice at the end forecloses a path with visible cost; the piece ends on recognition rather than a pressured decision, which flattens conflict despite the strong conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s search for renewed purpose in a failed-seeming rebellion—is signaled clearly, and the pressure does deepen as the stone hum intensifies and the vision reframes her role. However, the conflict remains largely internal and abstract, with no real pushback or hard trade-off; the choice to reengage carries conceptual weight but little felt sacrifice on the page. Escalation is present but gentle, so tension never quite sharpens into something gripping or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring culture in defiance of a repressive regime—is clearly stated, and the tension between secrecy and revelation is conceptually strong. In practice, conflict is soft: the only on-page antagonist (the guard) backs down with minimal resistance, and the unsealing itself offers no real chance of failure or cost. Internal fear of her power and of the regime is mentioned but not forced into a concrete trade-off during the ritual. Escalation exists but remains modest and largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Zara will be paralyzed by past trauma or able to act under pressure and then re-engage with life—tightens effectively around the photograph’s peril at the cliff edge. The slip on the loose stone is a meaningful escalation that forces a test of her somatic freezing and will. However, after this peak, tension relaxes into a relatively smooth reflective resolution; the costs of her stance feel real but are narrated more than freshly pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can move through her creative and existential crisis without being “blinded” by the light she seeks—is clear from early on. Pressure builds modestly as she chooses to engage with the scattered cards and redesign their order instead of retreating. However, the conflict remains largely internal and smooth; there’s no substantive reversal or sharpened dilemma that forces a painful trade-off in the moment. The result is emotionally resonant but low-tension for a piece aiming at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand her brother’s death and time’s distortion—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens when she finds the tent and especially when she chooses to touch the vial, which triggers the painful vision. Yet opposition is soft: the ink’s keeper is cooperative, and there’s no real risk of failure or misstep beyond emotional discomfort. The result is an inward, one-step escalation that feels sincere but relatively low-tension for the scale of the questions raised.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—maintain enforced order vs unleash “contraband truths”—is established early and maintained throughout. Escalation comes from the move from mere awareness (the letter) to active complicity (activating and copying the network under a live clock before alerts). The “within the blink that follows surprise” time pressure is asserted but not deeply felt in moment-to-moment action, and there’s no real reversal or meaningful tactical loss. The cost is framed as future social and personal fallout rather than an immediate sacrifice on the page, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    The main conflict—Elara’s commitment to pacifism and rootedness versus the external threat linked to her father’s legacy—is clearly signaled but only mildly tested. The key tightening is Kael’s warning and the offered blade, yet after she accepts it, the narrative softens into montage-like refuge-building without another concrete challenge or trade-off on the page. Stakes remain mostly conceptual (future danger) rather than viscerally felt through a specific incident or loss. As a result, tension never truly peaks and the cost of her stance feels more theoretical than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo so the garden can be whole—is articulated, but its cost is abstract: there’s little sense of what is lost if Kael fails beyond a generalized disharmony. Escalation is modest: the main tightening is the air shift and constellations freezing, which brings the goddess, yet Kael is never forced into a hard trade-off or sacrifice. His “agency” largely consists of aligning with patterns (walking in zigzags, listening), after which the resolution unfolds smoothly. As a result, the conflict reads contemplative rather than truly pressured, limiting tension and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (exposing a surveillance operation targeting dissidents) is clear and inherently high, and there is a nominal tightening as Eleanor confirms the misuse and the journalist’s disappearance. Yet there is almost no on-page resistance: she moves freely, uncovers a vast conspiracy with little danger, and the director scene is soft and inconclusive. Her “defiance” (recalibrating a telescope, then planning to publish) never forces a hard trade-off or visible loss, so escalation and cost feel underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Elara versus her own guilt, amplified by the firmware’s dissonance—is clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates when she discovers the letters and realizes they’re tied to the child she failed, forcing a new response instead of continued numb labor. However, the path from decision to resolution is quite smooth; there’s no serious setback, resistance, or visible risk in her choice to write as the child. As a result, the stakes feel significant in concept but relatively untested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—the risk of either flattening the grotto’s silence into easy meaning or honoring it at the cost of certainty—is clear and escalates as the mandala animates and reveals the prior people’s self-silencing. The main tightening arrives when she recognizes the flake as a “key” and consciously chooses to whisper into and then respect the hush rather than “solve” it. However, the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, with limited sense of what she might lose beyond comfort; the pressure is thoughtful rather than urgent. The final choice feels earned but not quite knife-edge in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether mercy can be re-centered in a brutal post-fire world—is clear but remains mostly abstract. Conflict is internal and societal rather than scene-specific, and there’s little escalation beyond deepening rumination; nothing in the present moment seriously threatens her or her project. Her main “choice” is to proceed with what she already believes, so the cost and narrowing of options are underdeveloped. As a result, tension exists conceptually but seldom sharpens into felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming a despairing version of herself and mending the fracture—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the echo-self takes the coin and the environment shifts. But antagonistic pressure is very low: the echo-self offers little resistance, there are no real setbacks or alternative options, and Mara never seriously risks failure or worsening the fracture. The resolution feels emotionally satisfying but comparatively untested, limiting tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict here is almost entirely internal and remains low-pressure: Elara’s unease and curiosity incline her toward action, but nothing and no one actively opposes her. The “stakes” of repairing psychic fractures stay abstract, and there is no significant reversal or moment where an option is clearly foreclosed. Her work through the night is a smooth, unimpeded progression rather than an escalation. As a result, the ending feels contemplative and resonant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s drive to understand and map emotional residues and then uncover a forgotten history—is clear but remains largely abstract. Conflict is mostly absent: the fossil’s miracles are benign, there is no opposing force, and Elara never faces a hard trade-off or real risk. Escalation is present in scale (floating fossil, hidden chamber) but not in cost; every new development only rewards her. As a result, the narrative reads more as a discovery vignette than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—unlocking and understanding the canyon echo—is clear but largely unopposed; there’s no real threat if she fails, nor a visible cost if she succeeds. The main “tightening” is the echo growing louder as she works and the discovery of the bone button, but these escalate wonder rather than pressure. Elara never faces a trade-off or foreclosed path, so conflict stays conceptual rather than visceral. The result is gently engaging but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara can reclaim her courage and sense of purpose—and it’s flagged early and carried through. There is a clear tightening when she confronts the pillbox at the bluff’s edge, and a soft reversal when the letter reframes courage as remembrance rather than something to be “found.” Still, external pressure is minimal, and the danger of the pill or the mission’s urgency remains abstract, so tension plateaus rather than sharply rising. The resolution feels emotionally appropriate but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.3)
    The nominal stakes—a conceptual revelation before the gutters stop—are stated, but they never bite; nothing on the page suggests a meaningful loss if he fails. Pressure doesn’t truly escalate: the cloaked figure appears, explains, and the coachman understands without serious resistance or trade-off. The internal conflict remains abstract, with no genuine competition between possible stances. As a result, the piece reads as a moodful revelation rather than a dramatized test under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.5)
    The main stake—understanding why the oasis resists change and what that means—is present from the start, but conflict remains almost entirely internal and low-friction. The glass’s growing glow and the alignment of patterns with shadows offer a mild escalation of mystery, leading to an insight, not a hard choice. Once Elara understands the kindness-beacon nature, the decision to teach villagers and heal the oasis is essentially unopposed and costless. There’s no serious trade-off, loss, or test of commitment on the page, so pressure never tightens in a way that would suit a “prestige” slot.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake is emotional and conceptual—whether Elara’s impulse to bring light into dark corners will find any human echo—but this remains mostly stated rather than pressure-tested. The main “conflicts” (her curiosity versus caution, his guardedness versus need) never bite hard enough to force a difficult trade-off. Her decision to descend and reveal the tooth is a soft tightening, not a true fork with visible consequence. As a result, tension gently hums but does not clearly escalate or extract a price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elena will remain a recluse-scholar or accept a more dangerous, integrated guardianship—and it is signaled early. Yet conflict is gentle: the library “tests” her, but never truly blocks or harms her, and no alternative path is seriously considered once she follows the hum. The main tightening is simply moving from surface to stone circle and touching the orb, which occurs without substantial risk or reversal. As a result, escalation reads more like a steady procession toward an inevitable epiphany than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract—Elara wants a transcendent sense of connection, but nothing crucial is at risk if she fails, and no opposing force pushes back. The central “conflict” (seeking understanding) resolves the moment she places the spiral, with no hesitation, setbacks, or meaningful alternative paths. There is a single mild tightening when the installation activates, but it feels more like a reward than a test. As a result, tension is low and escalation minimal, more contemplative than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    There is a clear stake—signal disruption and implied cosmic manipulation versus community and professional stability—but the on-page pressure escalates only mildly. Elara’s technical solution drops the interference without much resistance or risk, and the protests plus cosmic “power play” remain largely abstract or off-stage. Her final decision to stay vigilant is a stance, but the story doesn’t force a sharp, costly trade-off between personal, social, and cosmic stakes. The conflict functions, yet it never tightens into a genuinely fraught crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—overcome crippling claustrophobia to retrieve a reality-altering key—are clearly signaled and maintained. Pressure escalates from oppressive alleys to the narrow passage to the chamber’s contracting walls, tying external danger and internal fear together. The main turn is Elara’s choice to “embrace the mutiny,” which resolves both the physical and psychological threat at once. Yet the conflict stays relatively smooth; she never truly considers retreat or failure on the page, and the potential downsides of unleashing or aligning with “spatial mutiny” are not meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—pursuing Lila’s cold case as a vehicle for awakening empathy—is articulated but only lightly tested. The only overt external conflict (the approach of the tall figure) escalates tension briefly, yet fizzles when the figure simply vanishes without forcing a true decision or loss. Elara’s tightening grip on the lancing tool suggests danger, but nothing actually turns on that moment. The internal arc deepens somewhat, but there is no clear trade-off or price that narrows options, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—her great-uncle’s erased legacy and the broader atmospheric balance—are signaled early via the jet stream shift and family history. Conflict escalates when she uncovers the “reversible exile” and triggers the ritual, but most opposition is diffuse (ominous weather, eerie station) rather than active or adaptive. The announced dilemma (“to restore or to protect”) is strong conceptually yet not dramatized as a concrete trade-off with losses attached to each option. Because the story skips directly from her breath before deciding to a calm, resolved world, the felt cost of her choice and any narrowed options remain underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the hitchhiker sought and reaching pixelated amnesty—is announced clearly but remains largely conceptual and low-risk. Conflict is mostly implied (defying fate, breaking constraints) rather than dramatized through obstacles, alternatives, or credible failure modes. The journey into the wilderness and the scaffold-wrap unraveling are resolved without setbacks or costs; each “clue” functions more as a confirmation than as a pressure point. As a result, escalation is present in outline, but tension never tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The primary stake—Elias’s need to understand why paths circle back—is clear, but conflict is low-grade and mostly internal. The most concrete external friction, the encounter with his father’s partner, resolves almost instantly through a single calm remark, with no real sense of risk or sacrifice. Reading Lila’s journal provides information but doesn’t visibly force a difficult choice or foreclose a meaningful option. As a result, escalation is modest and the ending feels contemplative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to decode inscriptions and, through that, address her own hidden burdens—is clear but under-pressured. There is a gentle deepening as she connects the stars to the map and then to the plea for unity, yet there’s no real sense of what she risks if she fails or what harder alternative she’s refusing. Her “renewed purpose” arrives without a visible trade-off, and the path from ignorance to insight is smooth rather than contested. The conflict remains mostly conceptual, never quite tightening into a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—stabilize the chaotic vortex and confront the buried confession—is clearly presented, and Eira’s decision to surrender/unbend under pressure functions as the key turn. Internal and external stakes do interweave at the climax when the confession triggers the plant’s growth. However, escalation is relatively linear and unresisted; there are no substantial setbacks or hard trade-offs once she commits to entering the vortex. The lake’s threat feels grand in scale, but the resolution comes with limited on-page struggle or concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared at a high level—the world is “fractured and disjointed,” only she can mend the covenant—but the on-page conflict is low-grade and largely unopposed. The hedges close in and thorns snag her cloak, yet these never escalate into meaningful obstacles or force trade-offs; the clipping reliably illuminates the correct path. The single tightening is essentially geographic (deeper into the maze) rather than moral or tactical, and the climax at the pedestal is resolved by a straightforward, unresisted action. As a result, tension feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant conflict—freedom versus self-imposed duty to patch souls—is clear, and the tug in the roots plus the doppelganger confrontation mark a real tightening of pressure. Stakes escalate from low-level tending to an explicit reckoning that her “debt is due,” forcing an on-page recommitment that forecloses the path of leaving. However, opposition remains largely conceptual and polite; the figure does not seriously tempt or threaten her beyond verbal warning, so her decision feels somewhat pre-decided. More friction—real doubt or a concrete alternative—would heighten the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can find a livable stance toward his failed past and uncertain future—is clear. There is one primary tightening: his reflection moves from generalized loss to the specific question “What was his purpose now?” and culminates in the decision to reclaim the cloth as a bridge to a new story. However, pressure remains mostly internal and steady; there’s little sense that his options are narrowing or that a genuine alternative (e.g., deeper withdrawal) is on the verge of winning. As a result, the choice at the end feels meaningful but not heavily tested.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Eliara’s need to understand transition and resolve her haunted ambitions—is clear, but conflict remains soft and mostly internal. The main tightening comes when she decides to plant the seed despite fear, yet once she decides, everything unfolds without real setback or competing cost. Her mentor’s absence, potential danger, or the risk of failure never crystallize into specific threats or trade-offs. As a result, tension plateaus quickly and the story reads as a graceful unveiling rather than a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external stakes (a town’s chaotically migrating identities) are strong in concept, and Elara’s desire to stabilize them provides a clear goal. However, there is almost no on-page resistance: the ritual works on the first try, and no significant alternative tactic, sacrifice, or failure is dramatized. The internal conflict—accepting transformation vs. restoring order—exists, but it is resolved via reflection rather than pressured choice, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara serves her inspection duties or follows the pearl’s call toward a deeper, collective purpose—is only lightly pressured. There’s an implied time crunch (“timeframe… tight”) but no material consequence for ignoring it, and no active opposition in the caves. Escalation occurs mainly as an increase in mystical intensity rather than in real narrowing of options or moral difficulty. The crown’s activation feels foregone rather than wrestled with, so tension remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue hiding from her past or begin to truly face it—is clear but mostly articulated rather than tested through concrete on-page dilemmas. Pressure does build modestly: from solitary brooding to the jolt of the graffiti, to the encounter with the man, to the choice to trace her own map. However, there’s no sharp foreclosure of alternatives or vividly dramatized price beyond internal discomfort; the conflict stays emotionally resonant but somewhat static. The result is thoughtful but lacks the sharper escalation expected at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are largely conceptual (truth, role, meaning of the library) and remain abstract rather than sharply felt. The dominant pressure—will she accept being the conduit—is suggested but never forced through a moment where refusal has teeth. There are no substantive obstacles, only a sequence of invitations (the archway, the desk, the quill) she passively accepts. As a result, escalation is shallow and the cost of her final stance is more implied by genre expectation than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to use the violin’s power against the Dominion—is articulated early and returns at the climax. There is a coherent tightening as the coffee stains clarify danger and Dominion scouts appear below. However, the choice at the balcony feels almost inevitable; we don’t see viable alternatives seriously considered or a concrete price weighed beyond the abstract notion of sacrifice. The violin’s loss is meaningful, but the conflict never quite sharpens into a hard, painful trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The main stake—whether Elara clings to sparks or embraces stillness—is stated early but escalates gently rather than through sharp turns. The key reversal (reviving the traveler) is strong, yet after that the “conflict” becomes a calm lesson with little resistance or cost, making her final choice feel spiritually large but dramatically easy. The proclaimed apocalypse outside never concretely impinges to raise pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for contentment and understanding of rebirth—is clear, and the lake of memories is a natural place for that stake to be tested. Yet the story offers minimal escalation: once the hairpin reveals the map, every step proceeds without real resistance or risk, and Elara never faces a hard trade-off or the possibility of refusing the vision. The visions themselves reframe her life but do not present her with a choice that could cost her something in the present. As a result, conflict feels gentle and largely contemplative, limiting the piece’s dramatic power.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—guiding Mara out of paralyzing certainty into nuance—is conceptually present but never bites on the page. Elias encounters no obstacles: he reads the chimes, understands them, writes the letter, and departs without serious doubt or resistance. The “cloak of doubt” affects only an off-stage character, so tension never sharpens into a concrete test. As a result, the story reads as a gentle ritual rather than a pressured conflict with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara continues to withhold knowledge of her condition or finally reveals it—is signaled early and resolved at the end. Escalation is gentle: the trance, visions of her younger/older selves, and the second stone provide a clear tightening, but the pressure never feels especially acute or risky. There’s little sense of concrete external consequence if she speaks or stays silent, which keeps the conflict at a contemplative level. Her final act of disclosure is clearly her choice, yet the price is more asserted than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the arrowhead’s true nature and thus Kael’s way of “navigating without moving”—is clear, but pressure remains gentle and largely unopposed. The flock’s arrival and the interpretive sequence provide a single deepening, yet there is no strong sense of alternative outcomes or meaningful risk if Kael fails. The final inward turn reads as an expected consummation rather than a hard-won choice with visible cost. As a result, tension is meditative rather than gripping, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary stake—Eli proving a different kind of magic has value—is established, and the physical trap provides a concrete external pressure spike. The major tightening occurs with the chamber closing in and Eli forced to attempt mist walking. Yet his success comes on the first on-page try and halts the danger instantly, with no visible loss, injury, or sacrificed option. Internal stakes (identity versus conformity) are asserted but not sharply tested in a way that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will step into a larger, more mysterious quest—is present, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and very gently pressured. The main tightening is his discovery of the library and the key/book resonance leading to the vow, yet nothing meaningfully opposes him or threatens loss if he refuses. Escalation reads more as deepening wonder than as a narrowing of options with real cost. As a result, his final commitment feels low-risk and serene, limiting tension and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes are massive (the rebirth of a contracted universe), but on-page conflict is low-friction: Lira initiates the process, the machine works, the essence appears, and the coins do what she hopes on the first try. Pressure accumulates texturally—anticipation, doubt, then revelation—rather than through genuine obstacles or trade-offs. There is one meaningful deepening when the essence reveals images and recontextualizes the prophecy, but no option is truly foreclosed and no price is paid. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent, limiting the power of the climactic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will find any renewed purpose in the wake of her failed protection—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates modestly as the ritual succeeds, the monsters manifest, and the voices of past sacrifices rise, culminating in her decision to name and then to carry those names forward. The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no real resistance or risk that the ritual might fail or backfire. As a result, the arc feels moving but somewhat low-tension for the standard implied by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing a dead sea/world via the bell—is declared early, but the on-page conflict is very gentle. Eliard faces no real opposition beyond patience; his process unfolds without reversal, moral trade-off, or visible risk. The only “tightening” is time passing as the sun climbs, which doesn’t narrow options or raise cost in a meaningful way. As a result, the successful restoration, while pleasant, feels insufficiently tested for the scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are emotionally framed as “safeguarding the town’s soul,” but on the page the conflict is mild and largely uncontested. Elias does not face social resistance, internal doubt, or time pressure; once he finds the trail, everything proceeds along a smooth “and then” path. The one tightening—his decision to publicly exhibit the photos—is not experienced as risky or costly to him. As a result, tension and escalation remain low, limiting the story’s dramatic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire to reconcile logic and intuition—is established, but it encounters very little resistance on the page. The only moment of genuine tension is her brief hesitation before approaching the flame/altar, which resolves almost instantly without substantial doubt or loss. She obtains the crystal without effort, is invited rather than challenged by the flame, and emerges affirmed rather than altered at cost. The story reads more as a walking tour toward a foregone epiphany than as a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—deciphering chaos to “restore order” and preserve trust—is declared early, and there is a nominal tightening when the seeker recognizes a familiar but misunderstood pattern and chooses to “revise their understanding.” However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and abstract, with no concrete antagonist, clock, or visible consequence for failure beyond generic “breaking the trust that held their world together.” The pattern’s solution arrives smoothly once noticed, with minimal resistance or cost, so escalation feels muted and the resolution slightly easy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Kael reclaiming feeling and integrating or relinquishing the duplicate—is clearly signaled and resolved, and there is one meaningful tightening when the duel begins. Yet the conflict progression is smooth and low-friction: once Lira states the lesson, each step moves inevitably toward integration with little genuine doubt or potential for failure on the page. The duel lacks concrete reversals or trade-offs; it’s framed as a “dance of complementary opposites” rather than a hard choice between competing goods or harms. As a result, tension feels conceptually present but weakly dramatized, limiting the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias engages with this uncanny test versus safeguarding his haven—remains mostly conceptual. Pressure does increase slightly as the key glows and the storm-silence returns, but there’s little sense of real risk if he’s wrong. His choices tend to be default curiosities (planting, studying, then yielding to the pull of the brook) that lead to rewards rather than forcing trade-offs or losses. The conflict never fully sharpens into a moment where a live path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is clearly declared, and there is a sense of effort intensifying as Eli sings louder and grows more exhausted. Yet there is almost no genuine opposition or complication; the “impossible” task never pushes him into a hard trade-off or forces a meaningful adaptation. Escalation is primarily volumetric (more sound, more insistence) rather than a tightening of options with visible cost. The faint laughter arrives without any real risk of failure having been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—return home vs preserving the garden/library—arrives clearly once the keeper explains the pendant’s cost, and Elara’s decision to wait forecloses a real option. There is one meaningful tightening when the pendant is revealed as a key with consequences, but the escalation from there is relatively smooth and brief, with limited on-page wrestling or reversals. The cost of her choice is more told than viscerally experienced, which keeps the tension from peaking as sharply as it could. Overall the conflict is coherent and effective but could push further under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s relationship to failure and destiny—is clear, and pressure does tighten from contemplation to active ritual, culminating in the emergence of the sapling. Internal and external conflicts interweave reasonably: her desire to resurrect versus to transform is resolved through action with the crozier. Yet escalation is relatively smooth; there’s no real possibility of failure once the ritual begins, and we don’t see a concrete trade-off beyond abandoning one conceptual goal for another. Stakes remain mostly thematic and abstract rather than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the shard and “finding the beginning in every ending”—remains abstract and low-pressure; nothing tangible seems to be at risk if she fails beyond a missed mystical insight. The only escalation beat is the shard dimming and the melody faltering, which is resolved quickly once Elara corrects another assumption, so her commitment is never seriously tested. There is no antagonistic force or real trade-off, and no visible cost for success. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping, which is fine for mode but keeps the stakes from feeling consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    The core stake—rescuing the vanished ferry and its passengers—is clear and appropriately large. There is one strong tightening when Mara chooses to step into a rift “no one had ever returned from,” but after that, opposition and cost feel surprisingly soft; the rift journey and reset play out without genuine reversals or hard trade-offs. The ferry reset via the hourglass reads as a single straightforward action rather than a hard-won solution, limiting the sense of escalation. Her internal and external conflicts line up neatly without tension between competing goods or fears.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk losing herself to achieve genuine connection—is clear, and the shadow man’s warning functions as a genuine pressure point. Escalation is present in the gallery’s increasingly chaotic responses and the internal question of potential entrapment. However, the risk remains largely hypothetical: we never see a concrete near-loss or specific consequence beyond the general idea of being “trapped” or “unraveled.” The final cost (a tangled thread and a changed perception) is conceptually resonant but emotionally and situationally soft, keeping stakes at an abstract level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether human star-navigation and the towers will be abandoned in favor of alien immediacy—is articulated but not meaningfully stressed in-scene. Elara’s response (rallying students, creating a hybrid ritual) meets no real on-page resistance beyond Kael relaying the Council’s fear, so pressure never truly escalates. The timeskip to “weeks turned into months” with the towers still standing hand-waves what could have been the story’s crucible confrontation. As a result, the ending feels earned conceptually but not hard-won, with little visible price for her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can locate and honor the dead woman’s story—is clear but remains low-pressure throughout. The pulses leading her deeper and the thickening mist suggest tension, yet nothing genuinely threatens failure or forces a hard choice. Escalation is more atmospheric than structural; once the quest is stated, its success feels almost guaranteed. The ending endurance/commitment is resolved without a visible price beyond mild emotional exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes (fear vs obligation, physical peril vs metaphysical unknown) are clear but under-pressured on the page. The main escalation is the shift into the phase realm, which reweights knowledge but doesn’t confront her with a difficult choice or visible price there. Practical obstacles (crumbling facility, vault) resolve quickly and without secondary complications, making the journey feel smoother than the premise promises. The ending offers a stance shift rather than a hard trade-off, which limits the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the error that “killed” her and what it means for her existence—is clear and emotionally legible. There is a modest sense of escalation as the ink patterns align, the shard glows, and the ghost speaks, but opposition is minimal and every step works on the first try. Elara’s main agency is starting and persisting with the defragmentation; there’s no real trade-off or foreclosed alternative path. As a result, tension exists but remains low-key and never quite sharpens into a consequential dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving a dying language by performing a dangerous ritual—is clearly established early and followed through. There is a single main tightening when the diamond starts draining her, but the conflict never truly threatens failure or forces a hard trade-off; she simply endures until success. Internal and external stakes are aligned rather than in tension, so the choice-space feels narrow and largely foregone. The price (exhaustion, shattering diamond) is visible but not deeply dramatized as a meaningful loss beyond the functional tool.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes (proving her theory and metabolizing grief) are present but not tightly stressed: Lena never truly risks losing the arrowhead or being destroyed by the awakening cryptids. Escalation is mostly environmental (tremors, metamorphosing garden) rather than consequence of her choices, making her feel more reactive than embattled. The internal resolution—choosing laughter over bitterness—does foreclose a path, but the story doesn’t force a sharp trade-off to get there. As a result, tension is atmospheric more than acutely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can free the orchard from the statues’ control—is clear and escalates from private defiance to open revolt. There is one meaningful tightening when she realizes the shell is a signal and chooses to synchronize her heartbeat, triggering direct confrontation. Yet the conflict never truly bites back; the statues advance but are immediately neutralized by the roots with no intermediate loss, reversal, or visible price. As a result, the stakes feel more declared than viscerally tested at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—risking himself and his neutrality to deliver a potentially war-altering object, with his sister’s disappearance as personal fuel. There is one solid escalation in the patrol-drone chase and a sense of danger in the surveillance field. However, after that chase, opposition fades and the handoff/opening of the bottle proceed with little resistance or hard trade-off, so the apex beat feels under-tested. The emotional conflict (hope vs. disillusionment) is present but not pushed to a truly difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is the carpenter’s relationship to silence and purpose, but it remains largely implicit and low-pressure. Discovery of the halo and oasis is intriguing, and the act of singing to awaken the carousel is a meaningful turn, yet nothing resists him—no fear of using his voice, no risk that the magic could fail or harm him. The “escalation” is mostly an increase in wonder and volume rather than in cost or narrowing options. As a result, the climax is pretty but not tense, and his final stance involves little visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering and then safeguarding the fading realm of stories—is clear but remains largely conceptual and unopposed. The escalation comes mainly from the increasingly complex patterns (spiral → fractal → Möbius) and the library’s awakening, rather than from genuine friction, reversal, or sacrifice; everything she attempts works on the first try. Her final stance (“she… would keep its secrets safe”) is an alteration, but there is little visible trade-off or narrowed option set on the page, so the pressure feels low for elite-market standards. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with a lost dream—is legible, and the strange pulsing light constitutes a genuine deepening that shifts possibilities. Yet the piece lacks a sharp escalation of pressure: Elara never faces a consequential dilemma, setback, or trade-off, only an increasingly wondrous experience. The resolution arrives smoothly once the light cooperates, so the sense of earned cost or narrowed options is muted. As a result, tension remains gentle rather than tightening toward a decisive crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing a world-shaping idea trapped by fear—is clearly articulated, and there is one major tightening when Elara confronts the orb. However, opposition is soft: the living vault resists briefly but yields quickly to a remembered phrase, and no real reversal or deepening of risk occurs once she’s inside. The internal conflict (“haunted by fear for years”) surfaces as a brief hesitation rather than a pressurized struggle. As a result, the climax lands more as fulfillment of a foregone decision than a hard-won choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is clearly stated but remains abstract on the page; the live conflict reduces to “will she find a clue here?” with no real opposition. Escalation is minimal: discovery follows discovery without meaningful risk, doubt, or tradeoff, and nothing threatens to block or twist her search. The final moment crystallizes commitment rather than forcing a hard decision, so the sense of price or narrowing options is muted. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully “free” or reconfigure the trapped shadow and, by extension, honor her vocation—is present but remains largely internal and philosophical. Pressure does intensify slightly as the leaves shift and the shadow seems to “mock” her, but no real alternative path or meaningful loss is dramatized. The key turn (the mirror reading as portal instead of prison) is achieved without visible sacrifice or narrowed options. As a result, escalation feels modest and the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are stated as preserving “the color of wonder” and the orchard’s essence, but they remain abstract and never face concrete resistance. Elara never questions the seed, encounters no external or internal obstacle, and the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without cost or meaningful risk. There is a faint deepening as the seed becomes a glowing portal and the orchard “comes alive,” but no real narrowing of options or painful trade-off. The piece operates almost entirely without tension, which is a major limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—freeing the spirits bound in the net and absorbing their emotional weight—is clear and gently escalates through the increasingly resistant knots and the culminating flood of whispers. However, actual jeopardy or cost if she fails remains abstract; the piece never conveys concrete consequences beyond her own emotional strain. The stubborn knot provides a solid tightening beat, but the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the whispered chapel and bridging known/unknown—is clear but largely intellectual and spiritual rather than materially pressured. Escalation exists (from noticing a subtle misalignment to committing to days of digging to a significant discovery) but faces no real obstacles, opposition, or risk. Elara never has to choose between competing goods or endure meaningful loss; the path to success is linear and unthreatened. As a result, tension is mild and the final victory, while pleasant, feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant “conflict” is internal—Elara’s drive to parse death and release versus the inherent unknowability of those questions—signaled early via her relationship with Death and the “physics of letting go.” Escalation exists in a gentle deepening: the move from journal to map to captain’s study to letter gradually tightens thematic pressure. However, there is little real resistance or dilemma; each step unfolds without friction, and no option is truly foreclosed except a vague prior paradigm in her mind. The lack of a sharper on-page cost or test of her resolve dampens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can successfully encode and free the ghost during the brief storm window—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Once she recognizes the bolt plate as a key, the process unfolds almost without friction; the “timeframe between lightning and thunder” is stated as crucial but not dramatized through near-failures, hard trade-offs, or real jeopardy. Internal conflict (attachment to the ghost vs. need to release it) is gestured at but not pressed into a sharp choice. As a result, tension is present but never tight enough to feel truly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning/joy in the wake of her mentor’s death—is clear, and the riddle plus the encrypted diary provide a notional puzzle. Yet there is little real opposition; each “obstacle” floor offers up its clue without resistance or sacrifice, and no option is genuinely foreclosed. The emotional conflict is present but under-pressured, so escalation registers more as a gentle climb than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s theory about the sky remembering is true—remains largely internal and intellectual, limiting visceral tension. There is one meaningful tightening when the glowing cumulus approaches and exerts a “pull,” culminating in the decision to leap, but the risk is undercut by the safe, restorative aftermath. No external antagonist or concrete time pressure develops from the suspicious “failure” of the gondola. As a result, conflict feels gentle and contemplative rather than truly testing her values or forcing hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—solve the book’s puzzle and “mirror the sky inside walls” before the building comes down—are clear but stay mostly conceptual and aesthetic. Pressure escalates mildly via the building’s groans and final shudder, but there’s no strong reversal or moment where failure becomes a real option; she never has to trade off safety, abandon the project, or alter tactics. Her internal “test of limits” is announced more than dramatized through struggle. As a result, the story feels more like a graceful completion of a task than a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—unlocking stranded luminance and advancing Elara’s work/Thorne’s legacy—is clear, but conflict is mostly puzzle-solving without true opposition. Once the board glows, events unfold with little resistance; the hatch opens easily, the descent is eerie but not dangerous, and the map is simply waiting. Internal tension (loneliness vs purpose) is present but not sharply dramatized as a dilemma that forces a trade-off. As a result, escalation is more a gentle unveiling than a tightening of stakes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are gestured at—no one returns from the hall, time itself might be mended—but they stay abstract and emotionally distant. The piece lacks a sharp escalation where Elara must truly choose between competing costs; entering the hall is framed as dangerous, yet she encounters little real resistance and leaves intact with the prize. The vortex of memories hints at peril but resolves quickly without demanding a sacrifice or forcing a trade-off. As a result, tension plateaus instead of tightening through a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are signaled as planetary—restoring the nebula of respite—but the on-page conflict is gentle and nearly frictionless. Once the group commits, every step proceeds without real resistance or alternative paths: they find what they need quickly, and there’s no moment where success feels genuinely at risk. Internal conflict is minimal, so tension never meaningfully escalates; the bell’s restoration is foregone rather than contested. This leaves the piece feeling more like a pretty fable than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (averting doomsday / holding reality together) is announced early and tracked via the clock and the mending ritual. Escalation comes through sensory and symbolic tightening: the hush thickens, the beam stutters, the patterns glow more intensely, and doubt intrudes before she recommits. The resolution is earned by her renewed effort, but the opposition remains largely abstract, and success feels somewhat assured once the glow starts. The emotional and moral cost is present but soft-focus, which keeps the tension from fully matching the declared scale of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant external stake—rescuing the traveler from the labyrinth and birds—is clear and escalates from distant cry to active chase and near-attack. The internal stake of breaking or weakening the curse braids in via the nut and orchard, but it largely resolves in a hopeful flicker (the bud) rather than a pressured trade-off. Escalation is mostly one clean tightening (discover function → use in crisis), with modest interweaving of internal and external conflict. The absence of a sharper price (injury, irrevocable loss, or moral compromise) keeps the tension solid but not standout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain emotionally isolated or allow grief to become connective—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly through her engagement with the foam and chrysalis toward the internal decision to reinterpret separation and move toward others. The conflict remains almost entirely internal and relatively unresisted; there’s little sense that an alternative, regressive choice is actively pulling at her in the closing beats. As a result, the turn reads convincing but low-tension rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara retrieving the anomalous vial and “finding where stories begin”—is clear, and there is at least one discernible tightening when she must incise the glass ledge. Yet the conflict remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric; nothing truly opposes her, and no contingency is dramatized where she might fail or choose differently. The incision itself is executed without complication, and the vial’s power solves everything immediately. As a result, escalation plateaus and the ending lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform dangerous stored remorse into something gentler—is clear and thematically apt. Tension does rise from tasting incidental regrets to confronting the concentrated shard, which folds her own buried sorrow into the mix. Yet she never seriously risks failing, turning back, or being permanently damaged; the shard sequence is intense but not contested by any real obstacle or counterforce. The conflict reads as a smooth endurance trial rather than a crucible that narrows options with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reconciling a fragmented community—is clearly stated, but on-page resistance is minimal and success arrives smoothly once Elara sings. There is little escalation beyond volume and participation increasing; no one meaningfully pushes back or tests her resolve. Mr. Kovar’s entrance adds warmth but not real jeopardy or a traded cost. As a result, tension is gentle and thematic rather than gripping, limiting the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can repurpose the mirror to bridge past and present dreams and reclaim a sense of purpose—is clear but mostly internal and conceptual. The supposed danger of the synaptic plasticity process and the larger cultural collapse are mentioned but never escalated in concrete, scene-level ways. There’s a single gentle tightening as she finishes the modification and looks into the activated mirror, but no real reversal or narrowing of options. The conflict remains largely static introspection that culminates in a decision that doesn’t visibly cost her yet.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—acquire the “seeds of vigilance” and safeguard hidden knowledge—is signaled early, but tension stays largely abstract. Once gravity inverts, each step proceeds smoothly: no meaningful setback, rival pressure, or ethical friction tests Elara’s commitment. The only tightening is temporal (the rare inversion window) and spatial (labyrinth revealed), but these never feel close to failure. The result is a pretty journey rather than a genuinely fraught conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are primarily artistic and spiritual—whether Elara can uncover the sculpture’s hidden music—and they are clearly stated. However, there is almost no real opposition: the wood doesn’t resist, nothing goes wrong, and her belief in her method is never challenged. Escalation is minimal and largely implied by time passing from dusk to dawn and her deepening attunement to the insulator. The result is a beautiful but static arc that lacks a true tightening or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Alara will remain defined by punitive silence or reframe it into understanding—is clear, but the on-page pressure barely escalates. The chessboard’s autonomous movement and the knight’s sacrifice symbolically tighten her options, yet she seems ready to accept the “lesson” with little visible resistance or cost. There’s no external counterforce or serious internal backslide testing her resolve in real time, so the final decision to return feels more like an expected fulfillment than a hard-won trade-off. Tension exists, but it stays conceptual and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering her grandmother’s hidden inner life through the diary—is clearly signaled, but never faces a genuine on-page test beyond the brief suspense before the clasp opens. Elara’s method works on the first attempt, and there’s no sense of what she risks emotionally if the diary disappoints or stays closed beyond generalized longing. The internal conflict (desire to know vs. reverence for silence) is gestured at but never forces a real trade-off or painful choice. As a result, escalation is modest and the resolution, though fitting, feels low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s hunger for some ineffable “beyond” versus actually inhabiting her life—is present but kept at a reflective, low-pressure simmer. Escalation is gentle: her dreams intensify and the scent finally tips her into insight, but she’s never forced into a difficult trade-off or real risk. The corpse flower’s sprouting serves as a single tightening beat rather than a series of testing turns. As a result, the resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are large in theory—planetary resilience and a dying core—but the on-page conflict is soft: Elara encounters no real opposition, moral dilemma, or meaningful risk. The main tightening is informational (learning about the echoes and their fading), not a situational squeeze that narrows her options. Once the map appears, the rest of the mission proceeds smoothly to success; no solution attempts fail or force a trade-off. As a result, tension never quite crests into genuine jeopardy or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the catastrophe to prevent future ones—is clear but mostly intellectualized; there is little immediate danger or opposition in the scene. Pressure does not markedly escalate: once Elara reaches the collapsed stack and plane, the rest is explanation. Her “choice” at the end is essentially to accept a sobering lesson, without a trade-off against a competing desire. The result is thoughtful but low-tension, closer to an illustrated diagnosis than a conflict that tightens toward a costed decision.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential by freeing the sculpted hush—is clearly stated, and internal and external conflicts are notionally aligned. However, pressure remains largely conceptual; the timing requirement and her fears are asserted but never significantly impede or complicate her actions. There’s no reversal or substantive test of commitment: once she begins ringing the bells, success unfolds smoothly. As a result, the ending satisfies conceptually more than viscerally, with limited sense of cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk repeating a catastrophic mistake by using another world-bridging relic—is explicit. Yet on-page pressure is mild: the journey through the canyon is unopposed, and the choice to play the flute encounters only brief, largely internal resistance. There’s no concrete penalty or visible loss attached to her decision within the scene; consequence is promised but deferred. As a result, escalation feels like a smooth incline rather than a tightening that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can pursue transposed empathy without losing himself—is clear, and the key tightening comes when he touches the fragment and is nearly drowned in others’ emotions. His agency in deliberately disorienting himself and then struggling to re-ground gives the conflict some shape. Yet the risk of true psychic dissolution or failure never feels fully concrete, and the aftermath comes relatively gently, with little sense of an option decisively foreclosed. The escalation exists but remains muted and mainly interior, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is mostly internal—Elara’s relation to relics and to her mentor’s legacy—signaled from the start and modestly tightened as the pendant’s humming escalates. Yet external pressure is minimal: the delivery never feels truly in jeopardy, and being “late” yields no consequence beyond a line of dialogue. The revelation that the relic chose her is a meaningful knowledge turn but doesn’t force a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension is gentle, and the ending reads as a pleasant deepening rather than a sharpened, high-stakes shift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Elara’s desire to prove a theory versus the emotional weight of what she uncovers—is clear but understated. There is a discernible tightening when silence gives way to the prism’s grief and when she realizes it contains a dead child’s residue. Yet she never seriously considers abandoning her project or paying a visible price beyond momentary overwhelm, so pressure escalates modestly rather than sharply. The resolution feels earned but not heavily contested.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain in the safety of her weaving or follow the puzzle into the unknown—is present, with one main tightening when she chooses to leave home and later steps onto the bridge. However, the journey itself is mostly a sequence of curiosities rather than escalating tests; there is little sense of options narrowing or real risk deepening. Conflict remains largely internal and understated, and her decisions feel gently inevitable rather than hard-won. The result is a pleasant but relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying world—is clearly signaled and carries through to the end, with Eli’s decision to accept the bargain as the main pressure point. There is one meaningful tightening when he chooses to descend into “treacherous” abandoned shafts, but the danger remains largely abstract; we don’t see specific close calls or sacrifices along the way. The internal stake (losing his own awakening) is scarcely tested once the journey begins, so want vs. fear doesn’t deepen much beyond the initial agreement. The resolution is earned in plot terms, but the on-page price feels relatively low given the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are stated as emotionally large (the “weight” of truth, balance of countless universes) but feel abstract because they are never concretely tested on the page. There is minimal resistance: the shard transports her without trouble, the mysterious woman offers information and another shard, and the merged orb simply bestows her role. Elara’s agency is mostly limited to following the path laid out rather than making a hard, costly choice. Escalation is more a sequence of reveals than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understand and answer the warning to “protect the light”—is clear, and the lamp’s failure provides a concrete inciting incident. However, the pressure remains mostly conceptual; no ship in danger or immediate external consequence is brought on stage, so the urgency feels muted. Elias’s key act (rearranging the stones) resolves the main puzzle without significant risk or trade-off, and his final commitment costs him little more than internal adjustment. The escalation is present but gentle rather than tightening into a genuinely fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—guiding or confronting the unknown force in the fog—is present but remains abstract and low-risk. Pressure does nominally escalate (beam out of control, fog resisting, then gateway opening), yet each complication yields almost immediately to the Herald’s competence and enthusiasm. There is no point where the Herald must trade something away, endure failure, or seriously consider retreat. As a result, the climax reads more as a smooth unveiling than an earned crisis with palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake is whether painful stories should be shared or clutched—embodied in the woman’s decision about her husband’s story and Kael’s desire to understand why stories “magnetize.” Pressure does deepen slightly when she reveals her grief, but the outcome is never truly in doubt; Kael faces no resistance, and she quickly accepts his framing. There is essentially one mild tightening (moving from general philosophy to her specific loss), with no visible cost or difficult trade-off dramatized. As a result, the conflict feels more like a soft counseling vignette than a tested crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict and stakes remain abstract: Elias is under no clear threat, deadline, or moral bind, and there is no real sense of what he might lose if he fails. The dominant “stake” is thematic—understanding what trees witness and healing accumulated sorrow—which develops without genuine resistance. Escalation is mostly a change in information density (more dream fragments, more resonance) rather than pressure narrowing options. As a result, the final turn reads as graceful but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm and reuniting fractured communities—is stated early, but the on-page conflict around it remains mild. Elara’s search for song fragments progresses without meaningful opposition; roots and stream yield what she needs on the first try, and the final lullaby emerges with no real trade-off or threatened failure. Internal conflict (her scattered memories) is mentioned but not escalated into genuinely narrowing options. As a result, tension never tightens much, and the victory feels too assured.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s relationship to her own contradictions and isolation, but pressure on that stake remains mild throughout. The discovery of the invitation and the blank book are pivots, yet neither forces a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice—she moves from curiosity to acceptance without facing real resistance or consequence. Conflict is almost entirely internal and reflective, and even there it’s stated rather than sharply dramatized. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth incline than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and conceptual: Elara’s search for meaning and absolution in a decayed world. While this is a valid stake, it never meets a substantive on-page obstacle—no person, event, or inner resistance threatens her project or belief. The discovery of the plaque deepens her quest but doesn’t truly test it, and there’s no visible trade-off or loss. As a result, stakes feel abstract and the escalation modest, limiting emotional bite.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can preserve/understand these vows before they fade—is present but remains fairly abstract and low-friction. The main tightening beat is the anomalous slide and its transformation, which deepens her understanding rather than foreclosing options or forcing a hard trade-off. There’s little sense of danger, loss, or meaningful sacrifice; her new urgency comes without paying a visible price, so tension never truly sharpens beyond curiosity and reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving her father’s standing and the “truce of hush” by exposing a betrayal—is signaled early, and the encounter with the men at the pier is a clear tightening beat. Yet the danger in that scene peaks with a hand on a knife and some threats, then dissipates without a concrete test of her goal or a visible price paid. The story asserts victory and maintained truce without showing how her words practically foreclose the thieves’ options, leaving conflict and cost relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will accept a role that redefines her relationship to the world—is clear but only lightly pressured. The early metallic taste of “danger” is never cashed out into a concrete threat or dilemma, and the forests’ election remains an abstract process rather than an on-page crucible. The cloaked figure offers information rather than opposition, so escalation is mostly informational rather than conflict-driven. Elara’s decision at the end doesn’t visibly foreclose a valued alternative or impose a felt price, which keeps the stakes conceptual and somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant conflict—whether Elara will keep producing “lifeless portraits” or risk unleashing suppressed creativity—is clear and thematically coherent. There is one meaningful tightening when she discovers the self-portrait and note, which forces a stance. However, the escalation is gentle; after that discovery, her path feels almost frictionless, with little sense she might backslide or incur an immediate cost. The stakes stay largely interior and abstract, limiting tension despite solid coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Verdania will continue in comforting falsehood or move toward renewal through painful truth—is clear, and Elara’s decision to inscribe the conversations is a meaningful choice. Nonetheless, conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual; the undercity trip and chamber discovery offer atmosphere but little live opposition or risk. The tightest pressure point is when the whispers of betrayal make her leaves wilt, yet her struggle to proceed feels too quickly resolved. As a result, escalation is present but muted, with limited sense that serious alternatives or losses were on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (maintaining the “symphonies of truth” and color of wonder) is articulated but never truly pressured; nothing on the page threatens failure or forces a trade-off. The action proceeds as a flawless ritual with no setbacks, doubts, or alternatives considered. The glowing intensification of the iceberg and the resulting melody feel like expected outcomes, not earned victories under strain. Escalation is therefore minimal, leaving conflict and cost largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protect the farm and resolve inner static by confronting the box—appears early and tightens when the fears physically manifest and threaten to “consume the farm.” Elara’s decision to open the box and then to persist in miniaturizing resisting fears is an active, agency-driven response. Yet the struggle reads more as declared difficulty (“brutal,” “fracturing further”) than as concrete setbacks or narrowed options, so the sense of real risk or possible failure is dulled. The ending cost is clear, but the escalation path feels somewhat smooth and pre-assured.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—uncovering the mailbox’s secret and, implicitly, whether listening can heal past wounds—is clear, and there is a single escalation point when Clara chooses to open the mailbox. Yet obstacles are minimal: the intricate lock is instantly solved by a conveniently discovered key, and there’s no serious risk, opposition, or trade-off. The emotional cost of reading the letter out loud is gestured at but not deeply tested, so tension never truly tightens. The result is pleasant, coherent conflict with limited bite.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating lost knowledge and reanimating the lab’s legacy—is clear, but it never comes under sharp pressure. Conflict is almost entirely situational and internal, with no real antagonistic force, ticking clock, or risk beyond atmospheric decay. The central escalation (her dance unlocking mechanisms and passages) is conceptually striking but entails no hard trade-off or visible danger. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping, which undercuts stakes at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake—whether Eli can access deleted memories—is clearly stated, and the experiment in the chamber is a natural escalation from prior research in coffee grounds. However, conflict remains largely internal and low-friction: there is no real risk of failure, corruption, or loss emphasized as he initiates the ritual, so tension feels gentle. The fluctuation of gravity pockets is described but not leveraged as a meaningful hazard or trade-off. As a result, the climax resolves with relative ease, giving a sense of completion but not of hard-won consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing a destabilizing prophecy—is signaled early, and there is a recognizable tightening as the prophecy “resists” and the brook seems to hold its breath. Yet the conflict is largely internalized and smooth; there’s no significant reversal, loss, or tactical shift beyond “pressing on” with more will. The cost of success is mostly conceptual (ongoing vigilance) rather than felt as a hard trade-off in scene. As a result, tension feels modest compared to the declared scale of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will open herself to the “language” of buildings/people by breaking her isolation—is present but framed in a soft, philosophical register. Pressure rises somewhat through Elias’s revelations about the seal and “agreed-upon lies,” culminating in his concrete directive and departure. Still, conflict remains largely conceptual; no real counterforce or visible risk challenges Clara’s choice to knock on the door. Escalation is gentle rather than gripping, suitable for a quiet piece but below top-tier tension standards.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s stance toward the memories and her role as archivist, and there is a clear tightening when the memories flood and the figure tells her what’s at stake. Yet the conflict remains mostly internal and lightly contested; once the offer is framed as destiny and empowerment, she accepts without a hard trade-off or visible loss. There’s little sense that refusing is a live option that would cost her something different. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ascent into acceptance than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will erase the letter and, with it, her attached pain—is signaled early and pursued consistently. There is one main tightening beat when she hesitates with the thorn on the parchment, making the choice to proceed feel consequential. However, pressure is relatively gentle: once she commits, the thorn’s work unfolds without additional obstacles or reversals, and the cost is mostly implied relief rather than a hard trade-off. The internal and external conflicts align but don’t quite reach a bracing sense of risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will truly understand the nature of echoes—is clear but faces minimal resistance. Once she enters the chamber, the cloaked figure is cooperative and the pool offers answers without exacting a price, so escalation feels gentle rather than testing. The only real tightening is the moment of stepping through the archway and then kneeling to look in the pool, but neither is framed as a serious trade-off. As a result, the resolution feels more bestowed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—remembering and honoring a lost family—without substantial on-page resistance, risk, or failure. Elara’s method works smoothly; each dream yields useful information without complication, and there is no adversarial force, ethical dilemma, or time-cost tradeoff that narrows her options. The only escalation is an increase in information and intensity of vision, not in danger or moral weight. This leaves the piece beautiful but relatively low in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—Elara’s desire to understand hidden patterns and her place in them—is almost entirely internal and goes largely unopposed, yielding little real tension. The closest thing to escalation is the moment where the whistle “seemed to echo differently,” but that potential pressure isn’t developed into a genuine dilemma or tradeoff. As a result, the piece reads more like a lyrical meditation than a story with conflict-driven movement.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible early—understanding/skepticism vs a potentially dangerous anomaly, and later the preservation of life vs the risk of releasing something worse. Pressure escalates appropriately through the prison revelation and the manifestation of the shadow mass, culminating in a time-limited, high-cost choice to reinforce the seal. However, the ethical tension (sustain life vs stop the prison) is resolved very quickly, with little sense of alternative paths or serious temptation to choose a more selfish or expedient option. The cost is mostly environmental and implied rather than deeply personalized, which keeps the stakes solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will use the portico to uphold or overturn the existing order—is articulated and culminates in his activation of the artifact. Pressure escalates via the ominous storm and the increasingly insistent voice, but the internal conflict is asserted more than dramatized, so the choice reads relatively easy. The world-scale stakes (cities crumbling, new societies rising) are vivid in vision but stay abstract, with little concrete resistance or sacrifice on the page. As a result, tension exists but never becomes fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—can Elias coax and capture the music, thereby fulfilling his role as translator—is clear and does intensify when the box resists and then erupts into uncontrolled song. The key escalation is the shift from fragile single note to the box playing on its own, forcing him to drop the jar and simply endure the flood of sound. However, there is little sense of a meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path; the broken jar is a minor loss, and no real alternative or failure state is dramatized. The conflict remains largely internal and aesthetic, with tension present but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—guarding the key’s power from misuse—is clear early and remains coherent. Escalation is straightforward: the vibration intensifies, the figure arrives making a high-stakes claim, visions of global chaos raise the perceived cost of refusal, and the climax tests whether she will yield or weaponize the key. The internal vs external conflict aligns well, but the choice is resolved quickly once the figure reacts badly to the key’s light, softening the sense of genuine risk or sacrifice. As a result, tension is solid but not gripping at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming impatience into patience within herself and others—is signaled, but conflict is very low-intensity. Pressure escalates only gently through accumulating observation until the viaduct-top realization, without a strong test, reversal, or concrete trade-off. The resolution is conceptually fitting but feels unchallenged, as if no substantial option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core stake—uncovering systemic negligence and freeing herself from her mentor’s control—is introduced and followed through to a conceptual resolution. However, the on-page conflict is largely one-sided exploration without opposition, setbacks, or hard trade-offs; the symbols, compartment, and hidden room all yield without a fight. The revelation about the mentor sharpens internal stakes but arrives at the end with little challenge to her agency in that moment. As a result, escalation reads more as steady accumulation of clues than as a tightening crucible with visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will move from passive doubt to active advocacy for Thomas—is present but kept relatively low-pressure on the page. External conflict is minimal: Alistair fixes the heart without resistance and there are no concrete obstacles to Elias’s resolve. The main escalation is an internal deepening as Alistair’s comments sharpen Elias’s sense of responsibility, culminating in his choice to face the coming “storm.” Because no real option is visibly foreclosed and no price is concretely paid yet, the tension feels contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—cracking the yearning algorithm and manifesting the unheard bell—is clear, but on-page pressure remains mild. We see duration (“days turned into weeks”) and physical strain (calloused hands, bloodshot eyes), yet there’s little opposition or real risk if she fails, and no alternative path she must forsake. The algorithm’s breakthrough comes relatively smoothly once she spots the motif, with limited escalation beyond “work harder, feed more data.” The bell’s ringing is a conceptual high point, but it doesn’t force a difficult trade-off or close a meaningful door for her.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about a vanished crew and corporate erasure—is clear, and the discovery of the coordinates raises the conceptual stakes. Yet on-page pressure remains fairly low: the corporate threat is distant, the lockout is easily bypassed, and Elara’s lie to her supervisor generates no immediate pushback. Escalation is more informational than confrontational, so the final resolve carries limited visceral cost. The conflict works but never quite tightens into something gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance/empathy through the crystal—is signaled, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and remains low-resistance. Elara never seriously risks failure, harm, or moral compromise; each mirror simply yields information, and the fragments assemble themselves once she performs the correct ritual-like action. That leaves escalation feeling more like a guided tour of revelations than a pressured sequence of narrowing options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to reinterpret “the sound of approaching endings,” and this is clearly signaled. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little on-page resistance or genuine risk if she fails to change. The only notable tightening is the survivor’s direct question about “the end,” which prompts her realization but doesn’t foreclose a meaningful alternative path. As a result, tension feels steady rather than escalating, and the resolution arrives gently rather than under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconfigure her understanding of a failed, “mismatched” love into something that lets her live with it—is present but remains abstract. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely static, with one main deepening when she reads the vines’ symmetry as metaphor; there is little true escalation or testing of her stance. The final shift toward “learning to dance with the mismatches” feels more like a gently reasoned conclusion than a hard-won choice with visible cost. As a result, tension never tightens so much as softly gathers.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of wisdom before the prophet’s arrival—is clearly articulated, and consecrating the parapet is the main line of pressure. Yet the conflict stays almost entirely internal and is very low-friction; her momentary hand-to-dagger is undercut at once by the text stating there is no threat, removing potential escalation. There is a mild tightening as the prophet’s arrival approaches, but no real test, reversal, or cost, so tension plateaus. As a result, the ending reads more like completion of an assigned task than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s pursuit of personal and collective healing through reconstructing the factory’s story—is clear but remains largely untested on the page. Conflict is mostly historical and internal, referenced rather than dramatized; no force opposes her, and her process unfolds smoothly without a meaningful snag or dilemma. The only “tightening” is temporal and tonal (sun dipping, dusk), which shifts cadence but does not significantly raise cost or risk. As a result, tension is modest and never escalates beyond a contemplative hum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering a pattern that might revitalize language—is clear, and tension accumulates as the echoes coalesce and the crystal begins to weaken. However, escalation is primarily intellectual and descriptive; Elias faces little active resistance beyond patience and the abstract risk of the crystal’s depletion. The recognition that decoding the pattern will exhaust the crystal is a genuine tightening, but it arrives and resolves quickly, with minimal on-page struggle or trade-off. The conflict is coherent but remains low-temperature for the scale of the implied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can “locate” and hold onto the sound of aging—remains clear, but escalation is mostly textural rather than pressure-driven. There is a mild tightening as fog thickens, his uncertainty about moving backward arises, and he finally discovers driftwood and reaches the pond. However, his goal is never seriously jeopardized on the page, and he doesn’t face a sharply framed trade-off or real possibility of failure. The resolution is earned but not deeply tested, so the conflict feels contemplative rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully engage with runaway time instead of merely repairing a mechanism—is present but remains abstract. There is a mild escalation from the tremor and ominous spinning hand to the all-night labor of dismantling and rebuilding, but obstacles are mostly conceptual, not resisted or tested on the page. The conflict never quite sharpens into a consequential choice; once she has her insight, progress to success feels unimpeded. As a result, the final achievement reads more as a graceful realization than a hard-won resolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—reunite mother and estranged daughter before death—is clear and inherently high. Yet the on-page conflict is remarkably low: Claire agrees quickly, arrives “within hours,” and the reconciliation proceeds without resistance or a genuine risk of failure. There is one tightening (blood work confirms limited time, prompting Elara’s call), but no meaningful reversal or hard choice once the decision is made. The scene reads as a graceful enactment of a foregone conclusion rather than a pressured negotiation with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict and stakes are more declared than felt: we’re told of catastrophic potential and imminent awakening, but Elara encounters no real resistance or setback. The key test at the edge is the one major tightening, yet it unfolds without risk of failure, misfire, or sacrifice; she succeeds on her first, untroubled attempt. Internal stakes (her connection to the mentor, fear of error) are gestured at but never sharpened into dilemmas or tradeoffs. As a result, tension plateaus and the climax reads more like a calm experiment than an earned trial.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s desire to mend past wrongs and herself, culminating in whether she surrenders her certainty to the fountain; this does tighten into a single choice. That trade—cherished stone for unknown outcome—does carry a conceptual cost and functions as a credible turn. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and relatively unresisted; the maze poses no concrete failure risk, and the fountain’s demand is accepted with minimal struggle. As a result, tension feels modest and the pressure never quite bites hard enough for top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s quest to create a safe, gentle light that honors her vow—is present but tested only mildly. There is little real opposition: no on-page threat, setback, or moment where her commitment or method is plausibly at risk. Escalation is more tonal than structural, with the thickening mist and intensifying glow standing in for actual narrowing of options. As a result, the ending’s sense of “cost” and triumph feels soft and somewhat pre-assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake—whether Elara will risk letting another person into her protected space after a public wounding—is present but kept understated. There is a micro-escalation when Kai mentions the confession and asks to see where she finds peace, and again when he offers the notebook, but these moments pass almost frictionlessly. Elara’s hesitation is brief and not deeply felt as a live dilemma, so the emotional cost of saying yes never quite tightens. The piece functions more as a mood-driven encounter than as a scene of tested resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether Elara will accept the burden of others’ forgotten hopes and dare to write them—is clear, and pressure mounts as each cameo amplifies the emotional weight she carries. The key deepening is her encounter with the mother’s story, which crystallizes the potential cost of engaging fully. However, escalation remains largely internal and contemplative; no serious alternative path or real temptation to turn back is tested on the page. The final act of placing the shell and starting to write reads as a meaningful commitment, but with relatively gentle, low-friction conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stated stakes—village ailments, lost sacred practices—are high, but on-page conflict is minimal and largely internal. Elara never seriously risks failure; the first serious attempt we see works almost immediately once she starts humming. The only tightening is the tendril’s growing response to her song, which is more escalation-of-spectacle than escalation-of-cost. Without resistance or trade-offs, the resolution feels more like a foretold unveiling than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully binding safekept starlight into a living map—is stated but not felt as risky; Elara’s process proceeds smoothly with only a faint tremor that never threatens her goal. There is limited escalation: her heartbeat quickens, the world “exhales,” and the pattern glows, but no option is foreclosed and no sacrifice is visible. The ritual feels inevitable rather than contested, so tension remains low and largely abstract. As a result, the climax reads as a beautiful completion rather than a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—repair the timer to preserve fleeting wonder—is articulated but never put under acute, escalating pressure. Time passing from days to nights suggests effort, yet there is no reversal, serious setback, or moment where failure or sacrifice feels possible; the breakthrough arrives almost as a gentle discovery. The “wounded season” and rarity of the harvest read more as atmosphere than active constraint. As a result, tension remains low and the climax feels more like completion than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara remains trapped in her role or reorients toward self-understanding—is clear and thematically coherent. Tension rises with the figure’s probing questions and the offer of a choice, creating one meaningful tightening. However, the sense of what she truly risks (loss of role, identity, or something more existential) remains abstract, so the emotional and practical cost of her decision is muted. The conflict is persuasive but never feels truly dangerous or irreversibly consequential on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can relate to her grief in a new way through the act of carving—is clear and consistently tracked. Escalation comes primarily through internal deepening: tackling the mane and explicitly applying Marius’s “here and gone” philosophy to sorrow. The conflict stays mostly internal and reflective, with little external pressure or hard trade-off beyond emotional endurance. Still, her decision to persist and to reinterpret grief gives the ending a modest but credible sense of cost and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain trapped in regret or reconfigure her relationship to her “ghost”—is clear and carries through. Pressure escalates modestly via the static-voice discovery, the compulsion to collect more fragments, and the final reinterpretation of the ghost as guide. However, conflict remains largely internal and low-friction; there is no sharp reversal or concrete tradeoff, only a deepening of understanding. The ending is emotionally convincing but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, which keeps escalation in the solid but not elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli can momentarily resurrect the terminal and find a renewed sense of hope—is present but remains largely internal and unopposed. Conflict is essentially a gentle puzzle-solving exercise; every move works with minimal friction, and there’s no concrete price for failure or success. The main tightening is the conceptual shift as the terminal “responds,” but no options are truly foreclosed or meaningfully traded. As a result, tension is soft and escalation modest, more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to suppress her dream or reconcile it with her duty—is clear but kept at a very quiet simmer. The main tightening is the crystals’ shift from vague whispers to the pointed word “bear,” which nudges her toward a decision, yet there is little resistance or sense that she might truly choose otherwise. Her completion of the clock unfolds without substantial friction, reversal, or visible price beyond mild trembling and reflection. The piece functions more as a contemplative mood piece than as a pressurized conflict arc, keeping stakes and tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to uncover hidden truths that shaped lives—is clearly declared but remains mostly internal and abstract. Conflict escalates minimally: there’s a gentle tightening as intuition leads her to the right barge and the chest, but she encounters no real resistance, risk, or dilemma. The journal’s confession is a new piece of information rather than a hard test of her values or courage. The ending presents resolve without a palpable price paid or a narrowed field of options, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very gentle: can she decode the knots and grasp their meaning. There is no real opposition—no time pressure, no risk of failure, no competing desire—so tension never tightens, it simply unfolds. The key “turn” (realizing the rope is a map/guide) arrives without being earned through setbacks, trade-offs, or risky decisions. As a result, the stakes feel abstract and the climax reads as an elegant reveal rather than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is the woman’s identity as someone who waits in vain, and secondarily the traveler’s mission to witness and “write” that loss. Pressure builds quietly as the woman moves from silence to confession, and the key turn is the traveler choosing to write an obituary for the waiting self rather than the absent husband. The emotional cost is present in the woman’s tears and in the implied death of that long-held role. However, escalation is subtle and somewhat linear, with minimal sense that outcomes could meaningfully diverge; conflict never quite sharpens into a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is clearly signaled, and the assembly of the machine functions as the main tightening beat. Yet the on-page pressure remains relatively low: there is no antagonist, deadline, or concrete risk beyond internal unease, and Kael never faces a true dilemma where either choice carries a sharp, visible loss. The machine’s warning about “cost” is conceptually strong but not cashed out in specific consequences. Tension is steady and coherent, but more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—can she transform a sterile, scarred landscape (and self) into something that endures—is legible, but the pressure never truly tightens. There’s no real opposition beyond implied doubt; once she commits to the ritual, nothing on the page resists or threatens failure, so her choice is never stressed. The rain scent and shifting clouds hint at deepening, yet no option is foreclosed or price markedly raised during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the box to restore memories/the city—is clear, and the breadcrumb hunt provides a structural escalation from minor clues to the central fountain. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric; the box “testing” her through dimming and brightening never culminates in a real risk or trade-off. Elara’s commitment is not truly challenged, so the journey feels more like an inevitable revelation than a pressured choice under threat of loss. The result is engaging but low-tension, with conflict that remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to share light without fire—is conceptually strong but stays abstract on the page, with no concrete external opposition or threat. Escalation is mainly a gradual brightening of the garden and intensifying glow of the gear, without a moment where a genuine option is foreclosed or a real price must be paid. Elara’s agency exists but is never seriously tested; once she deploys sonar pinging, success feels inevitable. As a result, tension is low and the final success carries limited dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.6)
    The primary conflict is internal—Elara’s struggle to translate collective grief into stone—and that stake is signaled early. Pressure does deepen somewhat as Tomas’s maxim reframes her problem and the butterflies/ribbon pattern catalyze a breakthrough, culminating in her choice of how to carve and what to understand grief as. However, escalation is gentle and largely reflective; there’s no moment where she risks a meaningful loss beyond remaining stuck. The absence of sharper trade-offs or foreclosed options keeps the stakes from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s internal need for absolution and a more meaningful relationship to his duty—is legible early and resolved at the end. Yet conflict is almost entirely internal and low-friction: there is no significant resistance from the town, no real risk to his role, and no painful trade-off dramatized on the page. The “tightening” is essentially a single realization during the pendulum’s pause, followed by a smooth montage of positive impact. As a result, stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally tested, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the tapestry’s meaning—is clear, but conflict is almost entirely frictionless. There’s no substantive opposition, resource limit, or ethical trade-off testing his desire to know, so pressure barely escalates beyond the initial curiosity. The decoding “hours passed” functions more as process than as a tightening with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—reviving a stagnant kingdom’s creativity—is declared clearly but remains abstract on the page, with no concrete person or situation pressing back. The only real moment of pressure is Ignorance’s brief uncertainty before writing, after which the quill takes over and the conflict dissolves without a genuine test of his resolve or method. There is minimal escalation; once he decides to use the quill, everything flows smoothly toward success. The lack of visible sacrifice or serious risk keeps the conflict from feeling gripping or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost stories in a post–story famine world—is intriguing but stays largely abstract on the page. The pirate broadcast introduces a clear tightening of pressure (rare opportunity, she must capture it), yet there is no real opposition or risk if she fails beyond implied disappointment. After the song ends, her primary act is a decision to use what she has already written, which doesn’t significantly foreclose options or impose cost. Tension operates mostly at the conceptual and atmospheric level rather than as escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a promise and finding a way to honor impermanence—is legible, but there is almost no on-page opposition or risk to her carrying it out. There’s no significant escalation beyond a gentle build toward opening the pouch and scattering the ash. Internal conflict is gestured at (“weight of her task”) but never forces a hard trade-off or reversal. As a result, tension remains mild and the ritual reads more as a foregone conclusion than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—preserving the past vs. adapting to a chaotic present—is clearly signaled and embodied in the Kael/Lira dynamic. Pressure nominally escalates with the reported collapse, forcing him to consider losing his artifacts versus remaining entombed in his habits. Yet the key turn (his decision to go with Lira) happens quickly and without a sharply dramatized trade-off or visible loss, so the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. Internal and external conflicts do interweave, but no moment fully crystallizes a “no going back” price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving vanishing arts and communal harmony against a backdrop of indifference—is clear, but on-page opposition is mostly conceptual and summarized. Once Elara decides on the “subtracting noise” method, events unfold smoothly: the humming works, the choir deepens, new members arrive, and the performance succeeds without real jeopardy or reversal. There’s a soft escalation in depth and participation, but no pivotal moment where she risks failure or must trade off a valued option. The result is contemplative rather than truly tense, limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can catalyze a “gentle rebellion” in a world that’s forgotten nurturing—is mostly internal and thematic. Pressure deepens slightly as the celestial alignment peaks and her doubts surface, prompting the pruning/cleaning run, but there’s no meaningful external opposition or tough trade-off. Once the plant sprouts, events move toward success with little resistance. As a result, escalation is modest and the final victory feels assured rather than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and revealing the truth behind the blackout and drone hive—is clear, and touching the orb provides a meaningful deepening of knowledge. Yet conflict is very soft: there is no real resistance, moral dilemma, or risk in descending or in deciding to reveal the truth. Escalation is primarily informational and thematic, not pressure-based, and no believable alternative path is ever live. As a result, the ending reads more as an acceptance of a role than a hard-won or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are largely internal and low-intensity: Elias’s desire to understand “alive” houses versus the opacity of the world’s quiet stories. The act of sanctifying the objects is a deepening, but there is little sense that anything meaningful could be lost or broken if he failed. No genuine opposition—external or internal—ever forces a difficult trade-off or tests his resolve. The piece maintains gentle tension but does not truly escalate pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.1)
    The declared stakes (a disease ravaging Elara’s village) are high but remain distant; the on-page conflict is mostly whether Elara will proceed in unexamined certainty or adopt caution. Liora’s warning introduces a meaningful shift, but the escalation is modest and quickly resolved through Elara’s decision to “test further,” with no real on-page jeopardy or near-loss. The “cascading revelations” are more gestured at than dramatized as successive pressures. As a result, tension never tightens into a gripping crucible, even though the conceptual stakes are substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her fixation on a lost moment into a more sustainable idea of “perpetual motion”—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates primarily through the environment tightening and, more decisively, the loss of the chipped die, which forecloses the possibility of clinging to that talisman and forces a choice about how to understand her quest. The conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical; while effective, it never quite reaches a sharp dilemma between comparably costly options. Still, the renunciation of her prior goal carries real emotional price and gives the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict remains largely internal and gentle: Elara’s sleepless drift versus her need for meaning and connection to something forgotten. Once the brush activates, there is little real resistance, risk, or alternative path; she simply leans in and succeeds. Stakes (rousing a lost language, finding purpose) are conceptually large but never face an on-page test, and no concrete loss or trade-off is dramatized. As a result, pressure escalates only mildly, limiting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying tradition and, by extension, cultural memory—is clearly signaled early. Yet there is almost no on-page opposition: the community is initially apathetic but offers no real resistance, and the first ritual attempt instantly succeeds. Internal conflict (fear of loss vs. hope) is mostly summarized rather than tested in a crisis where a real option is foreclosed, so escalation feels more like a gentle swell than a tightening vise. The resolution is earned causally but too frictionless for high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—bending time to escape fate—is signaled early and followed through to the eruption and altered lighthouse. Pressure does increase (stone begins to glow, lighthouse shudders, island “resists”), providing a reasonable escalation. However, Elias is never forced into a sharp trade-off or tested with a real possibility of failure; he simply proceeds, and the world changes. The lack of a decisive, pressured choice under visible cost keeps the conflict from feeling fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Clara will remain ruled by her fear or confront it—is articulated early and followed through, with escalation shown via deeper rooms, more distorted reflections, and the frantic clocks. The decisive tightening comes when she chooses to “unbosom” her deepest terror, triggering the funhouse’s shattering and revealing fear’s true weakness. However, the path there feels somewhat guided and low-friction: the advisor provides a clear recipe, and Clara rarely resists or makes costly trade-offs. The conflict remains primarily internal and metaphysical, with limited sense of tangible risk or sacrifice beyond immediate dread.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving inner and environmental “dissonance” by answering the clouds’ call—is clear, and the musical exchange with the sky provides a gentle escalation. Yet there is no real sense of risk: Leeward never seriously doubts, fails, or pays a tangible price, and no live option is meaningfully foreclosed. The restlessness dissipates almost as soon as he fully engages his gift, so tension stays abstract and low-grade. The conflict functions, but remains mild and largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about the gate/watchers, which escalates into the survival of Valtara—is clear and grows meaningfully when the revelation about the dying turtles lands. The key tightening beats are the crack opening the unknown tunnel and the encounter with the watchers and living shell, which reframe the danger. Yet conflict remains mostly one-sided; external resistance is minimal and internal hesitation brief, so her choices don’t feel sharply constrained or costly. The ending establishes a large future task, but the on-page price for accepting it is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind noble lies—is clear, but opposition is diffuse and mostly environmental (dust, debris) rather than active or ethical. The riddle and hidden compartment offer light tension, yet Elara encounters no serious barrier that forces a trade-off or renunciation. Her internal stance shifts somewhat, but she doesn’t face a decisive moment where truth meaningfully endangers anything on the page. The conflict is thoughtful but too low-pressure for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual and emotional—whether forgotten dreams remain buried or are honored—rather than situationally urgent or risky. The main tightening comes with the recovered journal, which deepens his resolve, and the later revelation of the mosaic, which confirms the pavilion’s significance, but neither forces a painful trade-off or real sacrifice. Elias encounters no real opposition beyond physical labor; his goal is never seriously in doubt. The conflict is coherent but gentle, limiting tension and limiting the sense of genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering an honest record of the city’s origins—is conceptually high but on-page pressure is low and largely unopposed. The blackout is framed as a catalyst and mild time limit, yet Elara encounters no real obstacles, reversals, or credible risk beyond urgency. Her agency is present (staying during blackout, following patterns, using the stamp), but these decisions are not meaningfully costly or contested. Escalation exists structurally, but the conflict never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will keep trying to alchemize grief into product or accept its rawness—is clear and signaled early. Pressure coherently escalates via Lira’s confrontation and the basilica sequence, culminating in his deliberate act of unfolding the crane and reorienting his craft. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; no significant external or relational cost is dramatized beyond internal anguish, so the sense of price paid is gentle rather than cutting. The duty to record the ruler’s dreams is introduced but never really sharpened as a competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can Zara find a way to live meaningfully after catastrophic trauma?—is clear but plays out mostly as interior reframing rather than escalating conflict. The “hunt” and perturbation theory ideas hint at a methodical struggle, yet there are few concrete obstacles or reversals; she studies, reflects, and arrives at insight without much resistance. The cooling-circuit-breaker pause offers a potential clock but doesn’t materially tighten choices. As a result, the ending feels contemplatively earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant external stake—retrieving three chip fragments—is clear, but the search unfolds with almost no resistance or complication: each location yields its piece on first approach. The internal stake of “belonging” remains abstract until the final paragraph, so it doesn’t generate real tension in intermediate beats. There’s a shallow escalation (hidden alcove to tower to vault), but no meaningful reversal, trade-off, or price paid. As a result, the story reads more as a quest outline than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The main stake—whether Elias will continue to bury truths for money or confront his complicity—is signaled early and tightened through the ritual of sifting and the watch-hand/clock carving moment. The recovered memory of the erased father is a real deepening that forces him to abandon self-protective haze. However, external pressure is minimal and the final choice to “perhaps” stop lying is somewhat softened, so the felt cost and narrowing of options are more implied than acute. The conflict is coherent and escalating but remains gently pitched.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—whether two mistrustful kingdoms will agree to begin a new process of reconciliation—is clear, but its pressure is mostly intellectual and rhetorical. There is one main tightening: Kael’s voiced objection about neutrality being a “luxury” crystallizes the dilemma and forces Elara to refine her stance. Yet escalation is relatively mild, with no substantive trade-off or visibly painful cost; agreement comes after a single, well-spoken counter rather than a sequence of hard tests. The result is thoughtful but somewhat low-tension for the scale of stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central conflict—whether Mara will remain paralyzed by regret or re-engage with the water—is clear but remains largely internal and low-pressure. There is a gentle deepening as she shifts from clinging to the compass to trusting the utility poles and finally herself, yet no specific external test or reversal tightens the screws. Stakes stay somewhat abstract; we’re told of prior misjudgments but not made to feel a crisply dramatized risk in this outing. The ending choice is fitting but not hard-fought on the page, which keeps escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to his past and his capacity for empathy, and the main tightening is his choice to follow the sinking baseball into the lake. Internal and external conflicts align, but danger and cost feel low: there’s brief panic and physical exertion, yet little sense he might drown, damage the ecosystem, or meaningfully fail. The escalation is present but gentle, so the final shift, while earned, lacks a sharper test of his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is clearly stated, and the meeting with the guardian provides a potential turning point where her expectations could be challenged. Yet the guardian’s warning (“not what you remember”) is accepted almost without struggle; there’s no substantive test of her willingness to release the old bond or any real threat of failure. Conflict remains largely internal and quickly resolved, with little sense of options being foreclosed or true trade-offs made. The result is gently reflective rather than tense or pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—her relationship to lost time and family presence—is clear early and escalates as the cards and glowing crack force her to confront specific missed moments. The main tightening occurs when she chooses to unfasten the brooch and engage the saucer fully, leading to the vision and a changed stance. Conflict remains almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; nothing on the page seriously resists her new resolve. The emotional cost is felt, but the sense of risk or potential failure is comparatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking a dimension key to humanity’s survival—is announced strongly, but the on-page conflict is gentle and mostly internal. Once she engages the Tear and begins stitching, there are no real setbacks, trade-offs, or moments where her resolve or method is credibly at risk of failing. Shadow work is described more as something she has already done than a present-tense struggle that could cost her something now. As a result, escalation is minimal and the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will follow her planned pilgrimage or heed the hush and what this means for her sense of purpose—is clear but kept largely internal and low-intensity. The key tightening is the detour decision, and the release of the bottle is a genuine renunciation, yet opposition is soft and conflicts resolve without much visible strain. Coincidence/the numinous (the hush, the alignment, the prophecy) does a lot of the heavy lifting, with Elara’s agency more accepting than contested. Escalation is present but gentle, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—using the cradle of sparks to awaken the oppressed versus obeying the ruling order—is clear and potentially strong. There is a recognizably escalating path from quiet suspicion to discovery to direct confrontation with a superior. However, the confrontation itself feels low-friction: Thorne’s opposition softens almost instantly, there’s no real threat of physical or social consequence on the page, and Elara activates the device without a serious test of her resolve. As a result, the story reads more like a smooth unveiling than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can unlock and comprehend the sacred patterns—is clear, but it remains largely intellectual and spiritual, with minimal material or relational counter-pressure. Escalation is present (ritual intensifies → world stills → dust glows → universal alignment), yet nothing meaningfully opposes him; the sequence unfolds as a mostly unimpeded success. His fear of the moment is stated but not dramatized through hesitation or misstep, so there’s little sense that any option is truly being foreclosed. As a result, the ending is satisfying conceptually but light on felt price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara will confront the map of scars and move beyond censorship—is intelligible but remains largely internal and abstract. There is a mild tightening when the timer reaches its final click and silence falls, creating a soft decision point, yet no real reversal or escalation beyond “they hesitate, then proceed.” The past’s potential harm is gestured at (“truths they dared not speak,” “a life they had left behind”) without a concrete on-page dilemma or trade-off. The resulting conflict feels contemplative rather than pressured, which limits intensity for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—interpretive and philosophical—exists and is legible: how to understand the overture and the meaning of questions. Yet the stakes stay mostly intellectual; nothing material, relational, or reputational seems truly at risk, and Mara yields rather quickly once curiosity replaces defiance. There is a modest deepening as Elias presses his advantage, but no genuine reversal or hard trade-off. As a result, tension plateaus instead of tightening toward the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—can Elias and Clara carve out a sanctuary of beauty/resistance in a collapsing world—is clear but only lightly tested. Most developments go smoothly; there’s no substantive opposition to the rebuilding or to their use of the prison library. The main “turn” is internal (his sense of permanence and commitment to patching/rebuilding), which is conceptually satisfying but under-pressured on the page. As a result, escalation reads as an increase in lyrical affirmation rather than a narrowing of options or a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully push back against or reframe “fate” in the wake of loss—is present and clarified by her choice to seek the reel instead of remaining at the piano. Pressure escalates modestly when she steps into the reel and confronts her own memories, but the path is smooth, with minimal sense of risk, cost, or potential failure. As a result, the final stance shift reads convincing but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes—loss of collective memory—are strong on paper and clearly articulated from the outset. On the page, though, conflict is soft: the journey holds no real obstacles, and the guardian’s challenge is resolved with a single, thematically correct answer. There’s little sense that Elara might fail or pay a price beyond effort, so tension never truly escalates. The monsoon’s arrival functions as a test but not as a pressure that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transmute/regulate his regret—is clear, and the discovery of the chest and rising tide offer a gentle but meaningful escalation. His choice to read the letters aloud and then let the sea dissolve them constitutes an agency-driven turn. However, tension remains low-key; his success feels largely unchallenged, with little risk that he might refuse to let go or misread what the objects are offering. The conflict functions, but at a very quiet register for elite-literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the antagonist (the damaged state) yields immediately to the protagonist's experiments without resistance. There are no stakes that feel threatened, as the dust cooperates perfectly, removing the friction necessary for narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is absent; the protagonist moves from clue to discovery without encountering obstacles or paying a price. The central conflict (rival guild, missing apprentice) is resolved through a linear scavenger hunt that lacks genuine on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("understanding the new world") and lack immediate physical or relational consequences. The conflict is static; Elara tries a method, fails, and is rescued by Kael's discovery. There is no escalation of pressure or a moment where she is forced to choose between difficult options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that narrows his options. The search for fragments is resolved in a brief montage of successful actions ("Each discovery brought him closer"), and the climax is a procedural assembly task devoid of risk or trade-offs. The dominant stake (revitalization) is never seriously threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("survival," "hollowed") but never tested on the page; Mara faces no antagonist, no skepticism from the widow, and no logistical hurdles for the gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the maze acts as a passive container rather than an active opposition. The climax resolves via a magical interaction that demands no agency or sacrifice from Elara, deflating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the ticking clock (wall collapsing) provides structural pressure, the resolution lacks cost; the protagonist escapes and loses their burden (chains) simultaneously. The antagonism is faceless ("footsteps," "men"), and the escape is summarized ("dodged, weaved") rather than dramatized, lowering the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal doubt during the process. The escalation is procedural (she approaches, she acts, she succeeds) rather than pressure-driven, and the "cost" is an asserted emotion ("resonant ache") rather than a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the obstacle (a flower arrangement) is bypassed effortlessly, and the antagonist acts as a benevolent donor rather than a force of opposition. There is no escalation of stakes; the protagonist succeeds by simply showing up and possessing the required knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; the conflict is resolved by a decision to "let go" that meets no active resistance. The "melting ice" acts as a passive backdrop rather than a source of urgent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    The antagonist is an abstract "unseen enemy" who applies no immediate pressure on the page; the conflict is entirely internal but handled through assertion rather than dramatic testing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks active conflict; the oracle faces no external opposition or internal dilemma while performing their ritual. The stakes ("map of an endless night") remain abstract and theoretical, with no visible cost or risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is absent; Elara decides to act, acts, and is immediately validated without complication. There is no visible cost to the transparency; Kian offers zero resistance, rendering the stakes (mistrust) theoretical rather than felt. The scene lacks a turning point where options narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or active opposition; Elias faces no obstacles in his task, and the "unruly vines" exert no pressure on the narrative present. The dominant stake (self-validation) is resolved through meditation rather than struggle or trade-offs. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared (station destruction) but never felt because the solution is immediate and costless. The conflict is purely external and resolved by a simple lever pull, lacking the meaningful tightening or trade-offs required for literary tension. The ending asks "at what cost?" without actually showing one.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure does not escalate; the protagonist faces no opposition, dead ends, or difficult trade-offs. The resolution is immediate upon humming the tune, lacking a "meaningful tightening" or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and abstract throughout. The conflict is purely internal and is resolved through a conversation where a mentor figure essentially grants permission to feel better. There is no external pressure or deadline forcing the realization; the "swallowed truth" is a declared burden rather than a demonstrated threat to her safety or goal.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.0)
    Escalation is purely sensory (louder noises, lunging shadows) rather than a tightening of choices; the protagonist faces no dilemma or trade-off. The resolution is mechanical and instantaneous, bypassing the need for a decisive, costly act of agency. Conflict evaporates rather than resolving through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.7)
    The conflict is abstract ("unseen force," "crumbling peace") and lacks a concrete antagonist or obstacle to test the protagonist's mettle. The tension is atmospheric rather than dramatic, and the resolution is delivered through magical intervention (the mirror's work) rather than the protagonist's decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are minimal and abstract; Finn's fear is introduced and immediately resolved by Elara's intervention without escalation or difficult choices. There is no felt cost or trade-off; the protagonist faces no opposition that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is no discernible conflict, obstacle, or antagonist. The protagonist wants to go to a lighthouse and simply decides to do so after feeling a "surge of clarity." There are no stakes that are tested on the page, and the resolution comes without any sacrifice or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.9)
    While the stakes are cosmically high ("consume all dimensions"), they remain abstract and generate no felt pressure or risk for the protagonist. The conflict is resolved through a declared victory that lacks an on-page cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and grandiose ("unheard symphonies") without grounding in concrete personal loss or gain. The antagonist is a "pressing need" to beat exhaustion, but this pressure is told rather than dramatized through escalating obstacles. The conflict lacks bite because the consequence of failure is never established.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical throughout; the threat of "losing her way" is asserted but never dramatized as an imminent danger. There is no meaningful tightening of pressure; the character moves from one vision to the next without opposition or escalating consequence. The resolution comes too easily, missing the opportunity for a decisive action or renunciation that would earn the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no meaningful escalation or obstacle; the protagonist attempts a solution and it works linearly. The stakes (numbness vs. feeling) are declared but the resolution is granted by the tool/time passage rather than a high-stakes choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict is introduced but immediately diffused; potential threats (armed guards, the masked figure) evaporate without struggle or sacrifice. There is no escalation of stakes, as the protagonist faces no genuine opposition that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain low and internal; the protagonist faces little resistance after the initial purchase. The escalation sequence is a passive slide through memories without a moment of reversal or doubt that forces a costly trade-off before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is entirely cerebral, centered on a metaphysical puzzle with no immediate physical or relational stakes. The "impossible choice" is declared in the mirror vision rather than dramatized through escalating pressure or unavoidable trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the "sentient" hush is described as an antagonist but offers no active resistance or escalation. The stakes—bringing sound back—are thematic rather than visceral, and the resolution comes without significant obstacle or sacrifice. The tension flatlines as the environment immediately cooperates with the protagonist's desires.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.2)
    External stakes ("exposure or worse") are declared but never materialize in the scene, leaving the protagonist in a safety vacuum. There is no active opposition or internal resistance; the ritual succeeds without a moment of doubt or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the "danger" mentioned in the journal is ignored and never manifests on the page. Elara meets no resistance—emotional, physical, or magical—turning the climax into a procedural task rather than a dramatic confrontation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared ("risking the safety") but never tested on the page; the protagonist faces no antagonist, close call, or genuine time pressure. The narrative is a linear scavenger hunt that lacks escalation, as the blackout provides an opportunity rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain purely internal and abstract, with the "reluctant metamorphosis" facing no external opposition or logistical hurdles. The storm provides atmospheric noise but does not force a difficult tactical choice; the protagonist resolves the conflict by simply deciding to feel differently. There is no moment where the character must sacrifice something of value to achieve her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or obstacle that forces a trade-off. The protagonist wants meaning, follows a path, and is given the answer without facing any genuine opposition or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no opposition, and the environment and object cooperate fully to guide her. There is no escalation of stakes, only an accumulation of magical phenomena, resulting in a climax void of risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes remain abstract (boredom vs. feeling alive) and are never tested by a concrete threat or dilemma. The escalation consists of intensifying weather effects rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The protagonist faces no true opposition, only a compliant magic system that yields a reward for effort.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (leaving vs. staying) evaporates upon confrontation, lacking meaningful escalation. The resolution is devoid of pressure; the father's instant agreement removes the necessity for a difficult choice, resulting in a climax that feels frictionless and undramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or resource scarcity to generate pressure. The escalation is purely atmospheric ("air grew heavy") rather than a tightening of options or stakes, leading to a climax that feels frictionless. Without a moment where Elara must risk something or make a trade-off to capture the history, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and untested by genuine opposition or time pressure; the wanderer succeeds by simply finding the right container. There is no moment of escalation where failure feels possible or a price is paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks an antagonist or genuine obstacle; the protagonist faces no resistance, playing the instrument and receiving the answer immediately. Escalation is purely sensory (glowing, humming) rather than conflict-driven, resulting in zero felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("erasing history," "identity") and never translate into visceral, immediate danger on the page. The conflict dissolves without a felt price; the antagonist is dismissed by a sudden, convenient unity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are abstract; the threat of terraforming is mentioned but lacks immediate, visceral presence. The conflict consists of ignoring a beeping communicator, which generates minimal tension or escalation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "frantic" traveler sets up urgency that evaporates immediately against Elara’s "magnetic calm." No choices are forced, no trade-offs are made, and the stakes remain abstract ("trust," "symbol") rather than immediate or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are intellectual and abstract, with no visible cost or opposition; the cold is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, making the journey to the source feel effortless and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is no active opposition or escalation; the environment yields to Elias's efforts immediately and linearly without setbacks. The stakes are declared ("restore shared balance") but never tested on the page, as success arrives inevitably without trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=2.5)
    Tension evaporates rather than escalates; the life-threatening oxygen crisis is abandoned for a low-stakes hallucinatory sequence. The protagonist's survival is granted by magic rather than agency or sacrifice, rendering the stakes of the "distress signal" and the cave-in irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("freedom, or his doom") but never felt as immediate pressure within the scene. The "missing bodies" act as a theoretical clock, but no antagonist or urgent threat forces the protagonist's hand, leading to a low-tension resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes remain entirely abstract ("freedom," "reckoning") and never manifest as immediate, concrete threats or trade-offs in the scene. The conflict is internal and summarized ("grappled with conflicting emotions") rather than demonstrated through action or difficult decisions with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.4)
    Pressure is non-existent; the text explicitly states that potential obstacles ("relics") were "inspirations" rather than impediments. "Moments of doubt" are summarized rather than shown, resulting in a conflict-free progression with no stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.0)

    Stakes are purely declared ("time was running out") but never felt; there is no antagonist or obstacle preventing her access to the mailbox. The "mission" lacks consequences for failure. Escalation is absent; the character moves from point A to point B without a tightening of options or a rise in difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes remain purely theoretical ("the conspiracy is closer than you think") with no antagonist or immediate threat manifesting on the page. The "coup" is abstract background noise, failing to exert pressure or force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.0)
    Pressure is non-existent; the protagonist encounters no obstacles, opponents, or difficult trade-offs. The stakes remain abstract ("unspoken words") and are resolved by a single action that carries no risk. The narrative lacks escalation, proceeding linearly to a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared ("weight of what she was about to do") but never operationalized; the decoding process is frictionless and inevitable. There is no active opposition or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful opposition or escalation; Lira faces no risk of failure, no antagonist, and no environmental resistance. The stakes are purely internal and abstract, and the climax is a smooth procedure rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.2)
    The conflict is resolved instantly by a magical instruction, lacking the necessary escalation to make the outcome feel earned. There are no meaningful reversals, obstacles, or narrowing of options; the protagonist succeeds simply by agreeing to a new philosophy without testing it against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.0)
    The central stakes (Thought Tax) remain abstract and undramatized within the scene, replaced by a localized stealth tension that deflates instantly upon the "ally reveal." There is no escalation of pressure that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent as the environment immediately helps the protagonist ("conspire with her," "acknowledging her efforts"). There is no active opposition, no risk of failure, and no escalation of pressure, rendering the stated stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical ("forgotten names") and lack immediate dramatic pressure or an antagonist. The escalation is nonexistent; Elara faces no resistance, time limit, or hard trade-off, resolving the situation with a simple song that works on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist faces no external opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely walking to an inkwell and writing. The stakes are declared ("relationships at stake") but not felt, as the magic solution works immediately and perfectly. The conflict dissolves without the protagonist having to sacrifice anything or make a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are declared but never felt; the conflict between scholars and villagers evaporates the moment Elias presents his plan. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist faces a puzzle, solves it magically, and everyone agrees. The absence of a "no-win" scenario or necessary sacrifice flattens the dramatic tension completely.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain purely internal and abstract ("preserve the echo") without immediate external pressure or a visible failure state to force a trade-off. The narrative bypasses conflict through a sudden external clue and summarized success, resulting in a resolution where the protagonist pays no price and faces no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-pressure, with no external opposition or meaningful barrier to the goal. The resolution comes too easily via the terrace's magic and a sudden realization, bypassing the need for the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or endure a genuine struggle before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain theoretical until the final paragraph; the primary conflict is a passive internal search for "belonging" that encounters no resistance until the contrived alarm. The climax offers no difficult choice—she simply leaves when forced, paying no price for her "transformation."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the stakes ("before memory faded") are abstract and exert no immediate pressure on the scene's timeline or tactics. The protagonist faces no antagonist or resource scarcity, and the initial failure carries no penalty, rendering the final "success" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no tangible opposition; the crowd is immediately captivated, the trick works perfectly, and the environment cooperates fully. The story lacks a moment of doubt, risk, or trade-off. Without a visible price paid for the success, the stakes remain abstract and the tension flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.2)
    High stakes (erasure of existence) are declared but never effectively tested; the conflict evaporates instantly when the antagonist walks away, resulting in zero felt cost. The tension is deflated rather than resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is no meaningful conflict; Elias faces no external antagonist, physical obstacle, or internal reluctance. The "shift that was coming" is abstract and exerts no immediate pressure on his actions. The climax involves no difficult trade-off, rendering the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("equations for hope") and never face a concrete test on the page. The opposing force (the tide) is immediately negated by the protagonist's lack of concern ("did not mourn their loss"), resulting in zero felt pressure or cost. The concept of "serene upheaval" oxymoronically removes tension rather than creating a complex emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "legacy’s burden" is stated but not dramatized through resistance or trade-offs. The threat of the previous scholar’s fate (obsession) is introduced but immediately sidestepped; the protagonist faces no true obstacle or antagonist, merely following a magical trail to a safe resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict relies on "volume-knob" escalation: the mirrors resist, so she sings louder/pours more of herself in. This lacks tactical variety or a deepening of the dilemma. The stakes are altruistic but abstract, and the resolution comes from overpowering the resistance rather than a clever or costly maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no on-page escalation; the conflict is entirely summarized ("they talked, argued, and pleaded"). The leaders' resistance is stated but never demonstrated in a concrete beat, making the sudden resolution feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is low; the protagonist encounters no significant obstacles, external opposition, or agonizing trade-offs. The "risk" mentioned is abstract and off-page, resulting in a linear progression (walk, find, bury) lacking the escalation or cost required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared in abstract terms ("defy the lullaby") but effectively nonexistent on the page, as there is no opposition, risk of failure, or time pressure. The resolution is instant and absolute, lacking the escalation or trade-offs required for genuine dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical throughout, centering on a philosophical question of "boundaries" without immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or active pressure; Elara faces no opposition from the wind, the materials, or her own limitations. The "scarcity of monarchs" is an abstract background condition that does not force a difficult trade-off on the page. Escalation is absent; the story is a static description of a ritual without a turning point or price.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no meaningful conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal barrier, or environmental hazard that forces a difficult choice. The "hours turned into days" transition summarizes effort instead of dramatizing escalation, and the stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time crunch, or risk of failure during the central repair task. Escalation is procedural—she breathes, it glows, it works—lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or options are narrowed. The stakes remain abstract until the successful resolution, which demands no sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation of pressure; the environment "encourages" the protagonist, and she faces no external opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution requires no sacrifice or cost, rendering the stakes of the "breach" theoretical rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal resistance in achieving her goal. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("destiny," "inheritance") with no visible or felt cost paid to acquire the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("Time is collapsing") but remain abstract and external to the scene's immediate action. The resolution is achieved without a visible on-page cost or sacrifice, as the "price" mentioned is immediately resolved via undramatized negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the ship is abandoned, and the protagonist faces no time limit, antagonist, or physical danger. The escalation consists solely of the magical object glowing brighter, which signals progress rather than rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist encounters a problem and solves it immediately with perfect competence.

The lack of escalation or obstacles renders the climax flat, as the outcome is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks active conflict; the antagonist ("energy beings") provides atmospheric background noise but never actively opposes the protagonist. Lira encounters no failure, pays no price, and makes no trade-offs; the "storm" dissipates simply because she wills it to. The stakes are declared ("world trembling") but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is coherent; mechanical effort fails, forcing a higher-stakes personal sacrifice (memory) to achieve the goal. The cost is paid on the page, creating a clear before/after state, although the stakes ("order in randomness") remain abstract until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("lessons of history") but never tested; the protagonist faces no opposition, time limit, or risk of failure. The climax involves a simple physical action (touching the fog) that yields immediate reward, lacking the escalation or sacrifice needed to drive narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment does not resist, the people offer no opposition, and the "hopelessness" is a passive condition rather than an active antagonist. Lira faces no setbacks, rendering the victory hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is largely off-page (the conversation with Kael) and lacks on-page escalation. The protagonist faces no resistance in the grotto; the cicada simply "hums" and provides the answer. There is no moment of risk, trade-off, or tightening of options; the victory is effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the father is bypassed off-screen, the climb proves surprisingly easy, and the momentary loss of the doll is rectified immediately without penalty. The protagonist achieves her goal with no trade-off or lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are clearly communicated, and the pressure of the "suffocating presence" escalates logically to a forced choice. The cost—burning a bridge to a saved soul—is a strong conceptual price that lands on the page. However, the conflict remains abstractly magical; the antagonist is a faceless force, and the struggle is resolved through a contest of "will" and energy rather than a tactical maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no palpable conflict or opposition; the "pressure" is described as an invisible wall but offers no resistance to Elara's progress. Stakes are declared abstractly ("rebuild what was lost") but never tested on the page, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no authentic conflict or obstacle on the page; Eleanor wants the truth, triggers a mechanism, and receives it instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no concrete opposition, time pressure, or trade-offs, merely accepting a magical process. The stakes remain abstract ("reality itself began to shift") and do not force a revealing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful opposition or escalation; Elara finds the object, the file, and the answer immediately without obstacles. The stakes remain internal and low-pressure, with the resolution achieved through a frictionless process of discovery and writing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is external and standard (faceless enforcers), lacking personal stakes or specific antagonism.

There is no visible price paid for the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no effective escalation; the "doom" is abstract and the prophecy "softens" and "dissolves" without fighting back. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or moments of potential failure. The stakes are declared ("unravel the fragile balance") but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no opposition, risk, or trade-off; the protagonist succeeds at every step without paying a price. The stakes remain theoretical ("forgotten truths") rather than viscerally felt, and the lack of a "No" or a complication flattens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, no environmental hazard, and no internal dilemma that forces a sacrifice. The stakes are abstract ("understanding") and never imperiled, turning the plot into a tour rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and strictly internal ("understand the weight of names") without external pressure or time constraints to force a difficult trade-off. The "fear" mentioned is theoretical, lacking visceral symptoms or consequences for failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes dissolve immediately upon contact; the antagonist asks a single question before surrendering his deepest trauma, offering no meaningful opposition to the protagonist.

The central conflict feels theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the forest "urges her forward" rather than obstructing her. The central conflict is purely conceptual and resolved by fiat in the final paragraph. The stakes are abstract and lack immediate consequences; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, resulting in a narrative with almost zero tension.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("histories overlooked") and never subjected to a concrete test or opposing force. There is no escalation of pressure; Lila moves smoothly from discovery to resolution without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The narrative lacks a dominant conflict, relying instead on a passive scavenger hunt dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible opposition or conflict; the building wants to be fixed, and the ghosts actively assist the protagonist. The "trembling" hands and "pounding" heart are physiological cues unsupported by narrative pressure, as success is immediate and the stakes never feel genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or dilemma.

    Immediate opposition is absent; the antagonist faction is purely theoretical background, and the storm presents no physical danger. The stakes never tighten because the protagonist faces no active resistance or narrowing of options during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; the box is fixed, the journey is summarized, and the light is restored without sacrifice. The stakes are abstract ("balance," "light of midnight") and never press Elias into a desperate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.2)
    Opposition is virtually absent; the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's presence (boards pried open easily, doors unlock with a touch). There is no meaningful escalation of risk or pressure; the "delve" is a physical transit rather than a dramatic deepening of stakes. The loss of the compass is passive and carries no established emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are declared ("urgent") but never tested on the page; the primary antagonist (the storm) vanishes without the protagonist taking action. The conflict is purely mechanical, lacking any emotional or physical price that would justify the "transformative" conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are nonexistent; the conflict is a mild artistic curiosity with no external opposition or risk of failure.

    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to force meaningful choices. The protagonist moves from observation to success without facing opposition, resulting in a narrative with no escalation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or stakes. Lira faces no antagonist, no time pressure, and no internal dilemma; she simply obeys the lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.1)
    Pressure is non-existent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or dilemma, resolving the abstract conflict via a simple ritual that succeeds immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.3)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; Elara faces no physical difficulty, intellectual counter-argument, or resource scarcity. The potential conflict with the pilgrim is dismissed with a nod, and the climax involves simply placing an object on a pedestal. Without a visible or felt cost, the "homecoming" payoff lacks dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is zero conflict; the soil, birds, and weather cooperate instantly with the protagonist's goals. Without opposition or the risk of failure, the stakes remain theoretical and the "healing" feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are stated globally (sky colors) but not felt personally; Kael faces "puzzles and trials" that are summarized rather than dramatized. The resolution comes too easily via a "calculated" sacrifice that feels like a cliché chess metaphor rather than a desperate, earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.8)

    There is virtually no active conflict; Elara wants to find something, finds it immediately, and uses it successfully on the first try.

The "hidden thunder" provides atmospheric noise but fails to exert narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=2.9)

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is internal but externalized entirely through the magical spire mechanism, lowering the sense of personal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("afraid to leave it here") but the pressure is low because the "involuntary truth" side effect is barely tested before being cured.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.1)

The storm serves as a mood ring rather than a genuine antagonist or pressure system.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal hesitation in performing the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment cooperates instantly ("waiting for them"), and the transformation occurs with "grace" rather than struggle.

    Stakes are nominally high (the end of the world), but the on-page obstacle is minimal, consisting of a brief moment of doubt and a minor physical injury. The escalation lacks pressure; the character resolves the central problem with a single surge of "energy" and a memory, skipping the necessary struggle or tactical adjustment that creates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist faces no difficult trade-off or felt cost; the magic object functions as a "win button" that solves the labyrinth instantly. Without a moment where Elara must sacrifice something (safety, the nut, her anonymity) to succeed, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or external opposition; the protagonist enters, thinks, and leaves resolved without facing a concrete obstacle. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved by a change in perspective that requires no sacrifice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; Elara faces no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure. The "obstacle" of the glass case is overcome immediately with a "perfected method," and the "lull" explicitly removes the pressure of the crowd. Without a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a price is paid, the story lacks narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract ("threatened to overwhelm her") without manifesting as concrete external pressure. The climax involves touching an object and enduring a moment of described emotion, resulting in an immediate fix. The lack of a tangible price or the possibility of failure flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks meaningful opposition; the machinery and townsfolk yield immediately to the protagonist's first attempt. There is no escalation, reversal, or deepening of stakes, rendering the victory hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared in abstract terms ("unravel her mind") but never tested on the page; the repair proceeds without complication. There is no escalation, reversal, or meaningful trade-off to generate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the opposition (the lock) provides no genuine resistance to the protagonist's "magic" solution. There is no escalation of stakes, no moment of doubt, and absolutely no cost—physical, emotional, or opportunity—paid to achieve the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no visible stakes or meaningful obstacles; Elara simply waits for a flower to bloom. The conflict is purely theoretical (ambition vs. emptiness) and resolves without the protagonist having to make a difficult trade-off or face a setback. The lack of opposition flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the gravity inversion—a potentially lethal constraint—is bypassed without effort. The dominant stake (finding resilience) is abstract, and the resolution comes without cost or trade-off. The protagonist never faces a moment where she might fail or has to choose between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("unraveling the inexplicable") with no immediate threat, time pressure, or antagonist to force a tightening of options. Elara faces no obstacles in her survey; she simply arrives, sees, and concludes, resulting in a flat narrative arc without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the global stakes are declared to be high (saving the world from monotony), there is no on-page conflict or obstacle. The protagonist succeeds on the first try without facing opposition, error, or the risk of failure. The tension remains theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.8)
    External conflict is negated by the directional markers, and the internal conflict is resolved quickly without escalation. The protagonist succeeds on her first attempt without facing significant opposition or paying a price, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.3)
    Conflict is purely internal and abstract ("threatened to overwhelm"), lacking external pressure or distinct opposition. The escalation is negligible as the threat is resolved instantly by the protagonist stepping back, resulting in a low-stakes experience with no visible price paid for the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical ("prove a theory") and face no meaningful opposition; the "silence" obstacle is overcome instantly without a change in tactics. There is no risk of failure and no price paid for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the forest "whispers encouragement," and the puzzle solves navigation problems immediately. The stakes are theoretical (finding a message) rather than visceral, and the promised "sacrifice" is never tested on the page against a competing desire or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict is low-voltage; the "treacherous" mines are navigated via summary without a specific on-page test of skill. The central barter lacks a felt price, as the loss of "awakening" is an abstract concept rather than a visceral consequence affecting his later options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no genuine conflict; the environment yields instantly, and the "antagonist" (the mystery) is resolved by a helpful guide. The protagonist faces no resistance, resulting in zero escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is nominal; the opposition (fog) resists only via adjectives ("twisting and churning") while the protagonist’s resolve is instantly "unshakable." There is no escalation of pressure or risk of failure, resulting in a low-stakes progression where the outcome feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent. The antagonist (the woman's grief) offers no resistance to Kael's intervention; she accepts his presence and advice immediately. The protagonist risks nothing—socially, emotionally, or physically—turning the scene into a lecture rather than a dramatic encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no antagonist, internal obstacle, or friction; the repair process proceeds smoothly to success as the object heals itself.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, takes no risks, and pays no price for her transformation. The narrative functions as a guided tour where wisdom is handed down by an authority figure rather than won through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the environment cooperates fully ("courtyard seemed to whisper its approval"), and the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult choices. The stakes are abstract ("find the sacred") and are resolved by external affirmation (the plaque) rather than agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no antagonist or active opposition, only the abstract concept of "oblivion." The tension is artificial (a device whirring), and the resolution requires no sacrifice, renunciation, or difficult trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is nominal; the antagonist pressure dissolves the moment the protagonist speaks, lacking any back-and-forth escalation. There is no felt cost to the victory; the "thieves" are paper tigers who surrender to a vague threat about "the hush." The stakes are declared in exposition but never tested or imperiled in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs. The potential danger suggested by the "metallic tang" never materializes, and the "stakes" of the election are abstract concepts explained in dialogue rather than felt pressures. The resolution is unearned, as the protagonist is simply handed the answer and a magical object.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the protagonist moves from sadness to inspiration solely because she finds a prop. The story lacks a "tightening" beat where options narrow or costs rise; the resolution comes free of charge. The conflict is purely internal but resolved by an external coincidence, negating any sense of earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("survival often demanded compromise") but never tested against active opposition; the journey into the undercity is summarized in a single sentence, erasing potential tension. The climax resolves instantly upon the character's arrival, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a moment where failure seems possible. The solution comes too easily, rendering the city's plight mathematically trivial.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.0)
    There are no active stakes or opposition; the "fading truth" is an abstract background condition that does not threaten the immediate scene. Elara encounters no resistance in her work—the ice carves easily, the bells ring perfectly, and the sun comes out on cue. Without a possibility of failure or a price to be paid, the narrative lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("chaos threatening to spill out") but remain abstract shadows rather than a concrete, imminent danger. The escalation is low; Elara opens the box and immediately succeeds using her protocols, lacking a moment of genuine doubt, reversal, or resource depletion that would earn the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the "puzzle she knew she couldn’t solve alone" is solved moments later by a key she unknowingly held and an exposition dump from a stranger. There is no escalation of pressure, no trade-off, and no moment where Clara risks failure. The conflict is purely mechanical—a lock needing a key—and resolves without demanding anything of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist enters, solves a puzzle effortlessly, and advances without facing active opposition or the risk of failure. The stakes are abstract ("forgotten wisdom") and never threatened, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the "climax" is merely a procedural step rather than a desperate or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible conflict or escalation; the story is a procedural account of a successful experiment. The stakes—recovering memory—are theoretical, as no immediate threat or time pressure forces the character to act or risk failure. The resolution comes too easily, with the environment "acknowledging his presence" rather than resisting it, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict is abstract ("prophecy... threaten[ing] to unravel the balance") and lacks immediate, concrete stakes that force a trade-off. The escalation is internal and vague ("prophecy’s power resisting"), and the resolution comes without a visible price, violating the requirement for earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.5)
    There are no significant stakes; Elias offers a lesson, and Clara accepts it immediately with only token hesitation. The "cost" of the final action (knocking on a door) is negligible and not scaled to the "agreed-upon lies" theme introduced in the dialogue. The conflict is purely informational—she doesn't know, then she knows—lacking dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; there is no tangible opposition or risk of failure. The conflict is internal but undramatized, resolved instantly by a magical trance that removes the need for agency or sacrifice. The escalation is purely textural (more light, more memories) rather than a tightening of options or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low as the primary obstacle is a brief hesitation; the protagonist wishes to destroy the object, and she possesses the perfect tool to do so. The absence of external pressure or a complicating counter-force leaves the escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "test" to enter the mystery is a verbal assent ("I am") with no potential price. There is no escalation of pressure, and the stakes remain abstract ("seeking answers") without immediate personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=1.8)

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are clearly stated (survival vs. ancient danger) but remain external and abstract. The conflict resolution—a "final surge of will" and a scream—lacks a specific, dramatized cost or trade-off; the "cost" mentioned in the denouement feels asserted rather than felt on the page during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (world order) but abstract and devoid of personal pressure on the page. The central choice is binary and lacks friction; Elias faces no active opposition, and the "cost" of his sanity is mentioned in backstory rather than dramatized in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the escalation (the box playing on its own) happens to the protagonist rather than resulting from his agency, leaving him passive. The shattered jar offers a token physical cost but fails to establish a felt emotional or tactical price for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are abstract ("visions of chaos") rather than visceral, and the conflict dissolves instantly when the protagonist uses the artifact. There is no on-page cost—physical, emotional, or tactical—paid for the victory; the antagonist simply retreats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is no active conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, external or internal, merely observing until she succeeds. The "patient revolution" is a declared outcome, not a staked contest. No options are narrowed, and no price is paid for the transformation, leaving the story without narrative drive or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist faces no obstacles, threats, or time constraints while uncovering the truth.

The antagonist is abstract and absent, reducing the conflict to a scavenger hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the shopkeeper acts as a facilitator rather than an obstacle, and the mechanical repair encounters no resistance. The stakes (justice/innocence) are declared but not tested in the room, resulting in a low-pressure scene without meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; Lira faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure beyond her own desire to succeed. The narrative lacks a tightening of the screw; she works, she stumbles on the answer, and she succeeds completely, resulting in a low-tension progression that fails to engage the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is present (the system lockout) but lacks pressure, as the protagonist immediately bypasses it with a convenient tool ("old terminal") without consequence. The stakes are declared ("expose the truth") but not viscerally felt; the decision to lie happens without immediate interpersonal friction or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is nominal; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or mutually exclusive trade-off. The climax bypasses the actual struggle via summary ("The process was not easy"), resulting in zero tension and an unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are low; Elara is an observer who can leave, and the dialogue with the survivor lacks conflict or conflicting goals. The scene functions as a thematic prompt rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no escalation of pressure; the protagonist faces no resistance to her goal of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist performs a ritual that works instantly without opposition. There is no escalation of stakes, and the potential threat of change remains abstract and external to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is effectively nonexistent; the protagonist faces no opposition, external or internal. The "task" of arranging photographs proceeds without error, interruption, or emotional difficulty. Without a dominant stake or a moment where failure is possible, the story lacks the necessary tension to drive a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces an intellectual puzzle without active antagonism or the possibility of genuine failure. The "draining" of the crystal is a passive clock that does not force a change in tactics or a sacrifice of values, making the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the only obstacles are fog and a momentary confusion that resolves itself without cost. The story lacks a dominant stake that is tested; Elias wanders until he succeeds by authorial fiat rather than through overcoming a significant antagonist or internal limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.4)

    Stakes are declared ("reshaping the world") but never felt; there is no on-page opposition or escalation that narrows Elara's options. The narrative creates a frictionless path from problem to solution, lacking a "tightening" beat where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.3)
    Stakes remain abstract ("mending truths") without immediate physical or relational consequences visible on the page. The antagonist forces (maze, doubt) provide no resistance, and the final trade involves a symbolic token rather than a felt sacrifice, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure; the glass does not resist polishing, and the mist does not hinder her. The dominant stake (making light) faces no opposition, resulting in a flat narrative arc with zero escalation or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low and tension is nearly nonexistent. The potential threat of an intruder is dissolved immediately by Kai's gentle demeanor, removing any need for Elara to make a difficult choice about her vulnerability. The "brutal backlash" mentioned in backstory does not exert adequate pressure on the present moment, resulting in a scene that feels safe rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is abstract ("unease," "weight of another's pain") and escalates through environmental cues rather than active opposition. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma; the climax is a ritualistic placement of an object that guarantees success, lacking a "or else" consequence or a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal, as the antagonist is an inert object that yields to persistence without fighting back.

The "struggle" is summarized in montages rather than dramatized in specific, high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stakes remain abstract and the conflict is purely verbal; the antagonist presents a philosophical alternative rather than a concrete threat. Elara’s internal struggle is stated ("turmoil in her chest") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the wood yields easily to the knife, and the protagonist's grief is managed through simple reflection without a test of commitment. There is no moment where the character must pay a price or make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is minimal; the inciting force is a gentle whisper rather than a forcing function that compels a difficult choice. The resolution requires no trade-off or sacrifice; Elara retains both her sanctuary and her dream (mentally), resulting in a low-stakes ending that evades the prompt's requirement for a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is a complete absence of active opposition or escalating stakes; the world waits passively for the protagonist to uncover its secrets. The "architecture of lies" is a declared stake that never manifests as a concrete barrier, and the "upheaval" is stated but not felt in the static environment. The resolution comes without trade-off or sacrifice; the protagonist gains the "truth" simply by showing up and holding an object.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the "knot unlike any she had seen before" is resolved in the next paragraph by closing her eyes.

The protagonist faces no risk of failure, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the woman accepts the traveler immediately, and the "obituary" resolves years of grief in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are abstract ("reawaken beauty"), and the external pressure is low; Kael faces no antagonist or time limit, only a dark room. The "cost" of the resolution is stated as a philosophical concept ("patience") rather than a price paid on the page through action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and thematic ("to prove that scars can sing") rather than viscerally felt or tested by the scene. The environmental pressure (storm) is purely atmospheric and does not force a meaningful trade-off or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("trapped memories") and the protagonist faces no opposition or time pressure; the "pause of migrating geese" does not function as a ticking clock. The conflict is externalized into a video-game mechanic where the box glows to confirm she is right, removing the risk of error or the burden of decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or trade-off, merely achieving her goal by wishing it so. The "conflict" (light vs. fire) is negated by the setting details in the first paragraph, creating a vacuum where pressure should be.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the "impossible" task is resolved by a single moment of reflection without testing the protagonist's resolve. There is no opposition or "felt cost"; the transition from confusion to peace feels unearned because the obstacle was purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition from the townspeople, who accept his wisdom immediately. Escalation is flat because success is granted without struggle, negotiation, or the risk of failure.

    Stakes are declared (kingdom's future) but not felt; the obstacle is merely a moment of hesitation before magic takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.5)
    There are no active stakes or opposing forces on the page; the "pirate" nature of the broadcast implies danger that never materializes. Clara achieves her goal effortlessly, and the resolution—a reaffirmation of her existing desire—lacks a visible price or trade-off.

    Dominant stakes remain abstract and thematic ("honor him") with no active opposition, external obstacles, or escalation of pressure on the page. The "heaviness" of the task is stated but not dramatized through resistance, resulting in a flat trajectory where options never narrow and no trade-offs are made.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.6)
    The central conflict is intellectual and debated in abstract summary, lacking visceral, on-page stakes until the final paragraph. The escalation is driven by an external event (the collapse) rather than the pressure of the competing narratives, making the outcome feel disconnected from the character's internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("unlearning hatred") but never tested by a concrete antagonist or obstacle in the scene; the "encroaching noise" remains abstract. There is no escalation; Elara attempts one strategy ("subtracting noise"), and it succeeds immediately without setback or trade-off. The climax lacks tension because the outcome feels inevitable and unearned by previous sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no genuine opposition or antagonist; the "risk" mentioned is never dramatized. The climax involves pruning vines—a low-stakes physical action—rather than a difficult moral or tactical choice, resulting in zero narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain philosophical and abstract ("prove it was more than a ghost") rather than immediate or costly. The central turn is passive—a dropped object—which fails to test the protagonist's resolve or force a difficult trade-off under pressure.

No visible price is extracted (no cut hand, no bye-bye to former self on-page), so cost is present but soft. Agency is present—she kneels, places, accepts light—but the tightening deepens mood more than options.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost memory/time texture—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment heats. One meaningful escalation: the maze’s geometry snaps from elastic to Euclidean after the sacrifice, foreclosing further travel. Cost is conceptual (fragment lost, self reconfigured) rather than viscerally felt, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the seeds—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the literal wall-clock. Escalation is linear but effective: each decoded symbol narrows location, each jar grabbed increases physical burden, collapse intensifies jeopardy. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no one hands them the exit. Cost is visceral: chains snag, jars bruise ribs, dust chokes lungs—price is on the page, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover the sound of trust breaking—signaled paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each collected absence tightens the emotional cost until the forge crystallizes the ache in her chest; no coin-flip resolution. Agency is sustained: she kneels, palms, carries, places; the final stance crystallizes when she turns away, path foreclosed. Visible price: the ache she now carries alters her hearing-aid calibration—“now attuned…to memory itself.”

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—owning vs. releasing illuminated moments—signaled in paragraph 1; tightens when flower-code warns of soul-cost. One meaningful deepening: learning the jar holds a soul fragment forces Lira to reinterpret her goal under live moral pressure. Cost is legible: she forfeits the clean theft and accepts emotional weight of another’s grief. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting judgment-free space—tightens once: the act of sealing the bookmark inside the sphere abandons her last talisman, foreclosing retreat to safe nostalgia. Under Accumulative lens, pressure grows via melting ice outside and thinning glass walls until the final object embodies the cost. The price (loss of the bookmark’s tactile comfort) is visible on the page. A second tightening beat is absent; escalation is singular, not compounded, holding the score just above the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen identity—signals early and tightens through each decoding micro-victory. One meaningful deepening: the notes reveal “life stolen and rewritten,” raising the cost of failure. Agency remains with Elara throughout; no outside rescue. The mirror shatter is the visible price, satisfying the 8.8+ cost legibility requirement, though escalation is single-cycle rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—capture darkness forever—is clear early, but pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; the oracle never faces a live fork or visible price. Escalation is an accumulation of static tales whose silences deepen mood yet do not narrow the oracle’s options. The “last star” functions as symbolic clock, not a deadline that forces a decision. Without a beat where failure or loss looms, the conflict remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—find origin of thoughts—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: looped memories densify until the violin melody reweights the quest. The tightening is intellectual, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. Cost is conceptual, not felt, holding the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightens once: the folded doodle offer forecloses the option to keep hiding. Cost is present but soft—Elara’s racing heart—yet sufficient for 700-word scale. Agency sits with her; coincidence absent. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no secondary escalation needed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: prove self-worth to garden via visible repair ritual; secondary—fear of futility. Escalation is textural: each marble placed heightens ambient color/aliveness, tightening Elias’s perceived reciprocity. No external antagonist; pressure is existential and cumulative. Final placement crystallizes stance, foreclosing perfectionism with on-page conceptual cost—he concedes partnership, not conquest. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prove time moves sideways”—is signaled early and escalates through each calibration failure. One meaningful tightening: overload spreads station-wide, foreclosing safe retreat. Price (system failures, logged anomaly) is visible on page. Agency remains hers; coincidence does not resolve. Could use sharper on-page trade-off beat mid-escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the ghost’s code—threads every beat; escalation is textural: each water-stain reveals more notation, tightening Clara’s attention until she *must* vocalize it. One meaningful deepening occurs when the program vibrates in response to the ghost—knowledge shifts from “possibly random stains” to “deliberate message,” narrowing her options to *sing or fail*. Cost is felt but abstract: the program dissolves, the ghost departs, silence is replaced by resonance—yet no tangible resource is lost. The 7.2 reflects clean pressure under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of a visceral price (bleeding fingertip, voice cracking, lantern snuffed by splash) keeps it below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“find the swallowed truth”—is early and sustained. Escalation is linear discovery (noise → chamber → machine) rather than tightening trade-off; no option is foreclosed for Mara. Cost is borne by ghosts, not protagonist, so pressure feels observational. One meaningful intensification (whispers→screams) satisfies lens but lacks personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—witness vs. intervene—tightens once: the swan’s tremor forces the first active choice. Escalation is textural: each symbol (swan, map, mirror) accrues mass until the renunciation of agency becomes inevitable; the price is the library’s future decay written into her journals. No reversal, but a single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake is Finn’s fear-to-wonder shift; Elara’s goal remains therapeutic exposition, creating a spectator stance. Pressure escalates only for the boy, so the tightening is vicarious. The curl’s glow acts as external resolution rather than costly trade-off. Agency is therefore displaced, softening the eclipse’s narrative bite.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“restore the world’s dreams”—is declared early; pressure tightens once when scrolls demand the tapestry as focal point, narrowing options. However, Elara faces no visible resistance or resource loss; the ritual proceeds smoothly, so escalation is intellectual, not visceral. Cost is conceptual (world was hollow) but not personalized; she sacrifices nothing tangible, blunting the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake (“unravel mysteries / claim destiny”) is declared early but never tested; no visible price or foreclosed path. Pressure plateaus at “decide to journey”; escalation is iterative restatement of same mood. No reversal or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic possession—is declared early. Pressure accumulates via repeated questions, but each beat restates the same abstract threat without narrowing options or raising personal cost; escalation is tonal, not tactical. The climax is a declaration, not a decision that forecloses a path; therefore agency remains atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—summon the unheard symphony before exhaustion—remains legible; dawn acts as a live clock that tightens the final beat. Pressure escalates by accretion of luminous detail rather than reversal, sufficient for the lyric mode, yet the cost (collapse) is felt only after the music plays, not during the composing beats, so the tightening is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early; pressure escalates once when she reframes conquest as embrace. Agency is contemplative traversal rather than tactical choice; no option is foreclosed until final beat. Cost is conceptual (shift in worldview) but not viscerally felt; no credible loss alters tactics. Sufficient for low-6 band but lacks visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: reversed songs begin to “surface” buried emotions, narrowing her options to keep listening or stop. Cost is conceptual (raw aliveness hurts) but not material; no tool breaks, no time lost, no social price. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of alien melodies increases until the tear arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus solitary safety—tightens once: once he crosses the fence, retreat is foreclosed. The patrol pattern he intuits is a credible micro-turn that narrows options; cost is the literal exposure to armed guards and the conceptual loss of anonymity. Escalation is single-cycle yet sufficient for 700-word scope; the price is on-page in his racing heart and the final “burden and promise.” No coincidence resolves the tension—information is earned by intrusion, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: will Elias confront the scent-memory he has avoided? Pressure mounts accumulatively via each vial-vision, tightening his affective knot rather than narrowing external options. The meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes the pattern—scent as anchor to love and loss—yet the shift is internal recognition, not a forked decision with tangible cost. No external antagonist or resource loss is risked; consequence is emotional reconfiguration, sufficient under Accumulative lens but short of visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discover time’s texture or remain adrift—signaled in first paragraph; pressure escalates via pattern recognition that narrows options to three mirror-futures. Rope’s appearance and surrender constitute visible, felt price. Agency resides in observation/decision, not external rescue; coincidence absent. One meaningful deepening: mirror disclosure forecloses both drift and bondage, forcing the third stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“can she coax the land to speak?”—is clear; the only tightening is the violin notes finally swallowed then released, but the hush itself never counter-punches or raises price; escalation is a gentle swerve, not a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—deliver joy without attachment—tightens once: the dissolve commits Elara to irreversible half-truth. Pressure stays internal and lyric; no external antagonist, but stakes are legible. Cost is conceptual (she accepts impermanence) rather than visceral, adequate for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are thematic (“initiate compassion”) rather than tactical; no external obstacle or internal risk materializes. Pressure plateaus after the envelope is opened; escalation is replaced by epistolary summary. Meeting carries zero jeopardy or trade-off, so the tightening required for 8+ never arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—“find the Heart before the giant’s nap ends”—are declared early but never tracked; no ticking cue narrows options. Escalation is textural: pendant warms, canals bend, gate opens—each intensifies atmosphere rather than risk. The only cost is leaving the Heart, but that forfeiture is abstract, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    One dominant stake—decode ambiguous loss—anchors the piece, but pressure plateaus after the journal warning. Each discovery is handed to her: eyes, code, compartment, answer; she never hits a setback, sacrifice, or narrowing of options. The “danger” remains off-stage, so escalation is informational, not visceral. Closure reconfigures meaning, yet no tangible cost is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will she surrender control?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the leaf’s warmth forces the decision to rearrange pots. Cost is visible: drenched clothes, dissolved leaf, nursery order sacrificed. Agency pure: no outside rescue. Under accumulative lens, the deepening sensory density is sufficient escalation; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from chaos”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource or identity is risked. Pressure rises only once: the exchange moment, where she relinquishes the brooch for the book, yet this trade costs her nothing we can feel. Agency is present but low-temperature; escalation is a single smooth stair, not a fork that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—will she trust the unpredictable?—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: touch of pearl collapses her options into merge or retreat; she chooses merge. Cost is conceptual (identity diffusion) rather than visceral; no tangible loss is dramatized on page, holding the score below 8. Pressure is coherent under causal lens but never threatens her physically or ethically.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and sharpened when the valve awakens. One meaningful tightening: the note reconfigures isolation into vocation with visible price (lifelong summons). Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence (woman’s arrival) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she map or leap?—tightens once, at midnight, when the cracks arrow her away from the safety of charts. The punch-ticket act is the visible price, foreclosing her old identity in a single click. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word terrain; no secondary reversal is required, yet the lack of an external cost (lost blood, broken compass) keeps it just below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—longing for unnamed connection—surfaces early; escalation arrives via tile glow, melodic pull, and ancestral visions that narrow her skepticism until she accepts symphonic participation. One meaningful tightening at the tower apex reweights options; cost is conceptual (loss of detached stance) rather than visceral, adequate for length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—will he feel anything again?—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment’s hum offers the first tug of curiosity. The mid-scene escalation (storm energy channeled, dimensions mutiny) is visually strong, but the beat is narrated summary, not a choice point with visible trade-off; thus the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Still, agency drives the final rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the mathematics of a fair trade” between honesty and survival—is signaled early and crystallizes when Clara refuses the asylum lie. Escalation is single but meaningful: holding the pot crystallizes her stance, foreclosing the escape option. Cost is legible: father’s tightened jaw and the uncertain hand-hold show the relationship now carries a future risk. No external antagonist or second reversal, but internal pressure suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared early—preserve invented histories—but no alternative path is risked or forfeited; pressure escalates only in intensity of the hum, not in narrowed options. The peak moment is reception, not action, so agency is observational; cost is atmospheric rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens but staying modest.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased histories—signaled early; pressure grows through each discovered fragment. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the archive discovery deepens thematic weight but does not force a decision or risk. Agency is cumulative attention rather than a crucible choice; cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Escalation is steady texture, not tightened constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—collective survival vs. privatization—is signaled early and returns at every graffiti beat. One meaningful tightening: Festival of Lights turns passive art into active defiance, foreclosing Vorin’s timeline. Cost is communal, not personal; Lira herself pays no visible price, which limits upper band. Pressure stays coherent under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve historical trace vs corporate erasure—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the timed message forces her to risk being stranded. That single escalation is sufficient for length, but the jeopardy is more moral than physical; the on-page price is the photograph itself and the symbolic sand-grain squeeze—felt, yet not acute enough for 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore trust between people and delicate tech—is declared early and tightened when the drone’s hum flicks back to life. Pressure is situational-accumulative: depot anticipation, traveler’s panic, and Elara’s self-imposed standard layer until the sonic re-hum releases tension. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single intensification suffices. Cost is quiet but real: she remains while others depart, anchoring herself to perpetual repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stake—“find where rivers begin”—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical: no ticking clock, resource drain, or external antagonist threatens failure. The single meaningful turn (mist reveals fissure) is gifted by nature, not forced by a prior choice, so escalation feels observational. A visible price is absent; consequence is purely epiphanic, keeping tension in mid-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—revive the town via rhythm—is signaled early and accumulates pattern, yet pressure is static: each walk repeats the same risk-free success. No reversal, resource loss, or narrowing of options occurs; the bell’s return is pure reward without cost, so escalation plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—escape before oxygen ends—is announced early, but pressure collapses once visions start; no live clock affects later tactics. Agency is passive: memories happen to her, then the temple happens to open. Tightening occurs only in the first third; after that, stakes evaporate. Cost is therefore conceptual rather than visceral, and not legible on-page at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom via truth before bodies surface—is signaled early. Yet pressure plateaus after journal reveal; no intermediate beat tightens the ticking clock or raises physical risk. Escalation is present but single-stage, capping tension at functional rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—repay personal debt vs. collective sorrow—is signaled early, but escalation is lyric accumulation rather than tightening: each paragraph restates the same tension at similar intensity. The bead’s glow intensifies and the whispering chorus arrives, yet these events do not narrow her options or force a trade-off; she simply “steps into the endless night” with hope. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed, so pressure plateaus instead of peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is declared early and finally achieved, but pressure stays flat; each corridor offers only more inspiration, never a narrowing option or visible trade-off. Escalation is textural (color seeping, corridors brightening) rather than a tightening choice. No credible loss or reversal complicates tactics, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—is declared early but remains abstract; no external obstacle endangers the dig or her claim to the site, so pressure stays internal and diffuse. The only tightening is the moment the hollow is noticed; coincidence (roots “seemed to shift”) rather than a hard choice escalates tension. Cost is retrospective (“she had come here broken”) rather than a price paid inside the scene. Agency is observational wandering, not tactical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning before the letter mails”—tightens when chalk coordinates reveal live mailbox deadline. Agency drives escalation: Lyra deciphers, kneels, traces, opens. Cost is conceptual (world moved on, past echo remains) rather than visceral; no tangible loss alters later tactics. Coincidence limited to finding unmailed letter, which complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the flame alight to preserve cosmic listening—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: Lira’s arrival narrows options from “wait” to “synchronize tonight.” No second reversal, but the single tightening is meaningful: dawn deadline forces all-night embroidery. Cost is conceptual (observatory as gateway secured) rather than visceral; hence caps below 8.8. Agency is Elara’s decision to stitch the new path, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve and confront an unsent apology—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each condensation message tightens emotional density until the revealed letter forces a public-to-self confrontation. Agency is present—she presses shard, reads, breaks seal—but the cost (shame, exposure) is more implied than dramatized on the page; we are told “for the first time, Elara felt whole,” rather than shown a physical forfeiture. Still, the final note from spirits gives audible confirmation that silence has been broken; pressure resolves into new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—give voice to the vanished child’s sanctuary—signalled early via “unknot the meaning.” One meaningful tightening: deciphering the final phrase forces her from interpreter to messenger, foreclosing private withdrawal. Cost is conceptual (shared grief now hers to vocalize) but not viscerally dramatized—no loss of safety, tool, or social capital on-page. Pressure escalates through knowledge, not external jeopardy; under Causal lens this suffices, though price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover lost creative joy—is declared early and intensifies when film memories force her to redefine “canvas.” One meaningful tightening: wall canvas is abandoned for fog canvas, a visible trade-off. Cost is felt (she cries, leaves walls behind) but pressure remains steady; no second beat narrows options further. Sufficient for 600-word scope but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened when the obsidian-eyed woman demands the trade. One meaningful deepening: the mural’s figures step out only after Elara cedes control, foreclosing her old method. Cost is conceptual (loss of former self-concept) rather than tactile; a visible forfeiture (tool dropped, coin spent) would have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—Lexicon infiltration—arrives late via Krane’s declaration, not through on-screen pursuit of a concrete test. Escalation is prospective (“tonight we fight”) without on-page narrowing of options or forfeiture. Agency is limited to accepting an invitation; decoding the seed presents no risk, cost or alternative path foreclosed. The beat qualifies as one informational tightening but lacks visible price, so pressure stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes—“transform the ache into verses that echo across centuries”—are declared once and never tested; no visible obstacle or forfeiture emerges. Pressure accumulates through repetition of lullabies rather than escalating risk; the shell’s humming response is atmospheric, not adversarial. No tightening narrows her options; weeks pass without tactical change. Consequently, the climax is a release of mood, not a cost-bearing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is signaled early; pressure stays single-track. One meaningful tightening: the chime shatters, forcing the song to finish without its original instrument; this narrows option from repair to pure voice. Cost is aesthetic (broken relic) not visceral; no reversible loss alters later tactics. Escalation is mood-intensification rather than consequence-chain, fitting Accumulative lens but capping tension at moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore trust—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when she lifts the quill: one chance before paths diverge. Escalation is internal but visible: fear → resolve → ink-flow gamble. Cost legible in vulnerability of non-language inscription and Kael’s still-mixed expression. Coincidence absent; resolution arises from her chosen act, not inkwell magic alone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent eruption of cultural conflict, not lava—is signaled early and tightens once when the poem’s last line reweights his task into a sacrifice metaphor. Because the actual cost is social consensus rather than a tangible loss (tool, status, time), the pressure feels conceptual, not visceral. Agency is present—he sketches the design—but the turn is micro, not reversal. Sufficient for 7-band entry but short of the visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. isolation—signaled early; firefly cadence externalizes it. Escalation: pattern density of lights increases, narrowing option to “dance or flee.” Cost legible: foregoes last escape seconds to mirror pulses. Agency clear, though external pressure (implosion) partly supplies clock; still, her dance is decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—recover the slipping memory of grandmother’s laughter—broadcast early. Escalation is textural: each failed image-dissolve tightens Lira’s focus from memory → emotion → seed-trigger until the forest path flickers into visibility; the act re-prices earlier failures. No reversible antagonist, yet the glass/seed ritual narrows options under coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual rather than a live forfeiture, slightly softening the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“monotony versus orchestrated wonder”—is declared early but remains atmospheric; no concrete asset or relationship is risked. Escalation is pattern-based: each crowd twitch tightens the bishop’s path, a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Yet the final alignment brings acclaim, not loss or trade-off, so pressure plateaus rather than narrows options. Cost is felt by the audience, not the performer, keeping personal stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defiance of erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: dust glow intensifies, footfalls trace constellations, garden blooms brighter under tension. Single meaningful tightening when sentinel appears; live option (flee) is foreclosed by her straight-spine stance with visible social cost. No swappability; the verse-on-skin act is inseparable from the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“illuminate the mundane before change”—is declared early; pressure intensifies texturally via accumulating light/mist images rather than narrowed options. The climactic “noctilucent reckoning” is an internal vision; because no external obstacle or price is risked, escalation is gentle, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—translate personal guilt into shared language—remains abstract until the final paragraph; no concrete test or forfeiture is staged. Pressure is atmospheric (moon, box hum) rather than causal; no option is foreclosed by Elias’s agency. The single “tightening” is imagistic (cracks glowing), not a decision that raises cost. Coincidence (finding the box) initiates but does not resolve; still, escalation is flat—no visible price alters later tactics—keeping this below the 7.0 floor for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can hope be quantified—is signaled early and resolved by renunciation. Single meaningful tightening: rising tide physically narrows options, turning decoration from proof into ephemeral ritual. Escalation is situational, not causal; agency is endurance rather than decision, visible on page. Cost is conceptual (loss of permanence) rather than viscerally felt—enough for 7-band, not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early and tightens when the diaries warn “to listen is to lose oneself.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the mirror: knowledge that walls dream of being remembered narrows her future path to voice-bearing. Cost is conceptual (she abandons pure cartography) rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the cadence shift from discovery to stewardship satisfies escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mirrors must flip from truth to possibility—tightens once: resistance → surrender under the bell countdown. Escalation is textural: color density and heartbeat borrowing increment until surrender; cost is legible on-page (“her own heartbeat now fainter”). No false coincidence; agency is Elara’s song. The single deepening suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—end the cycle—signaled early. Escalation is textured, not causal: each night’s talk thickens exhaustion; the zenith stars mark the deepening. The speech acts as the single tightening beat, but its cost is rhetorical, not a forfeiture of a live option. No new constraint or price alters later tactics, capping the entry to high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—redeem extinction she helped cause—is signaled early and re-asserted at burial. Yet pressure is static: no obstacle, ticking clock, or internal counter-move complicates the walk; the only “tightening” is finding the damp spot, which is luck, not agency-driven escalation. Cost is projected (future exposure) rather than lived on-page. No option is foreclosed during the scene; thus escalation remains conceptual, satisfying basic but not high-band standards.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“awaken the city”—is signaled early; escalation is the tightening of the lattice: each loosened thread raises the risk of losing a memory-voice, a causal micro-cost. Agency is continuous—every finger trace is a choice that materially changes the lock. No visible price is paid by Elara herself (no injury, social loss, or irreversible bodily change), so the cost feels external; this keeps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—whether his puppet shows heal or manipulate—signals early but stays philosophical; no external test or audience reaction materializes to raise visceral cost. Internal pressure tightens once: the stick’s weight forces reframing from dismantle to rebuild. Accumulative lens holds; each tactile revisit of stick deepens rather than widens options. Cost is conceptual (loss of subversive identity) rather than tangible, keeping escalation cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—memorializing absence—signals early; pressure is atmospheric (scarce monarchs) rather than tactical. No on-page option narrows or forecloses; Elara’s ritual completes unchanged. Escalation is a gentle thickening of texture, sufficient for Accumulative lens but lacking a felt price that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—resurrect forgotten names via melody—is signaled early and tightens once: the rope must be rewoven correctly or the memory stays buried. Escalation is accumulative: each braid loosened adds luminous density rather than new external risk. Cost is aesthetic (the aurora’s final flare) rather than a lost opportunity; this keeps pressure legible but not viscerally foreclosed, capping the band just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths choose walkers?”—is signaled early and deepens through each dream iteration. Pressure escalates texturally: storm + glyph motion + seal glow tighten the cadence rather than narrow external options. No visible price is paid (no failed decoding, no bodily drain), so the cost stays intellectual rather than visceral, capping the score below 7.5. Still, the final reconfiguration is earned within the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    Central stake—gaining secret knowledge—never meets a visible opposing force or trade-off; tension is declarative (“rumored to hold the key”). No beat forces Kael to relinquish time, safety, or belief; discovery is effortless once the tile appears. Because nothing is risked or foreclosed, escalation is rhetorical rather than operational under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will Kael release resentment?—is signaled early and tightens once when he asks “How do I start?” foreclosing the refusal option. Pressure is situational: the sanctuary’s silence and Elara’s calm impose social scrutiny; no external danger escalates, so cost is emotional surrender rather than tangible loss. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 650 words; the micro-turn from scoff to whisper delivers visible price. Agency stays with Kael; coincidence never intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—erase the boundary between ruin and dream—signals in line 3 and tightens when fog resists her breath cadence. One meaningful deepening: the prism clears to show shifting light patterns, forcing her to adapt her breathing tempo—options narrow to “match or fail.” Cost is visible: the restored sextant’s glow fades, implying the gate will close; she must keep breathing in cosmic sync, an ongoing toll. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (fog thickens) but never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can renewal exist after breach?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the vow is physically rewritten onto the tree. Escalation is accumulative: each gadget ups the ante until the ribbon’s relocation makes the new covenant irreversible. Cost is visible—Elara’s old contract literally rots on the branch she abandons. No external antagonist needed; internal stance shift is sufficient under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—access to nonlinear knowledge—signals early; escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern of mirrored reflections and keeper encounter deepen the cost of pursuing the orchard’s secrets rather than narrow external options. One visible price: Elara forfeits her prior detached-cataloguer identity—cost is legible in the final “brightened disquiet.” No reversal, but a meaningful stance crystallization fits situational lens. Pressure stays coherent, though low-tempo lyric mode keeps tension more medial than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—library access—signaled early. Escalation is situational: labyrinth resists, traps narrow options; chrono-blossom pick is one visible tightening with on-page cost (garden shifts, doorway appears). Stakes remain abstract (“reshape reality”) without concrete loss or forfeiture. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates. No secondary stake or moral calculus, so depth plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—reach the garden—signaled early; pressure escalates only via atmospheric accumulation (denser fog, brighter card) rather than narrowed options; no credible loss or trade-off appears. Agency is passive: follow glow → read → door appears. Escalation is present as cadence shift but lacks visible price or option foreclosure under Accumulative lens. Sufficient for mid-band; 7+ would need a moment where she must surrender something to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared early—“translate confusion into clarity”—but never tighten; no alternative path is foreclosed, no price exacted for failure. The single escalation beat (final braid) is a success without complication, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens. The archive beyond the door is a reward, not a cost, keeping escalation below the 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—silence the storm—signals early; pressure escalates only descriptively (“air growing heavier”) rather than through narrowed options. One meaningful turn: seed is dormant → Lira conjures “song of silence”; the cost is poetic, not tactical. No credible loss alters her method; bloom solves problem it didn’t help create. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not causal tightening; suffices for short form but lacks 8.8+ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove meaning inside collapse—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is single-cycle but meaningful: each failed alignment narrows options until only memory sacrifice remains, visible price paid on-page. No antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Coincidence (star cluster mirrors shard) complicates rather than rescues, fulfilling lens guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: preserve/fix collective memory before shadows vanish; signaled early. Middle tightening: wingtip shadow points to fog wall, narrowing her path from data-gathering to visceral channeling. Cost (felt awe & responsibility) visible but low-impact—no tangible loss or time limit pressed. Escalation is present yet gentle, fitting lyric/accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—the fortress populace’s morale—is signaled early and tightens only once: from wilted silence to cheers. The single meaningful escalation is the mosaic reveal; it is beautiful but costless for Lira, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Agency stays cosmetic—she never risks failure, scarcity, or social push-back. Because luck never complicates and no option is closed off, the conflict remains a one-way uplift escalator.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“texture of time” discovery—signals at line 5; pressure deepens via cicada’s warming hum that forces renunciation of old method. No external antagonist; tension is epistemic, internal. Escalation is single intensification (stars pulse, cicada re-carves) that reweights her chronicler identity; cost is conceptual loss of linear certainty. Sufficient for length, but price could be sharper on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—access true silence versus lifelong claustrophobic fear—is signaled early and tightens once: the doll slip momentarily threatens loss of talisman/nerve. Escalation is situational: external clock (one-hour inversion) plus trellis fragility force calm efficiency; protagonist adapts rather than reverses course. Cost is present but lightweight—she risks falling, yet no tangible loss occurs—so pressure feels moderate, not crushing. Still, the hourglass is live, options shrink by the sentence, and the final silence reweights her future, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“will silence actually heal Mira?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the vial’s indigo swirl forces Elias to pick a quieter sector, narrowing options. Pressure stays situational, accumulating through auditory texture rather than causal reversals; cost is felt but soft (lost time/fare not foregrounded). A single meaningful deepening suffices for this length, yet the absence of any tangible price paid by Elias keeps escalation shy of 7+. Still, the hush-to-clarity cadence cleanly reweights the stake under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reach throne before sunrise—announced early; sunrise never presses again, so tension plateaus. Escalation delivered through mural discoveries and mechanism puzzle; each correct click forecloses wrong path. Cost is conceptual loss of personal power, felt in final star-bright moment. Agency present at each puzzle beat; luck absent. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—sanctuary survival—tightens once when Lira severs her own scar-bridge to power the ring. The tightening is protagonist-driven and narrows her future options (she loses one soul-link). Cost is visible: ring cracks, scar gone, knees collapse. A second pressure beat (e.g., darkness adapting) would elevate to 8.5+ band, but single meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—translate personal pressure into literal value—signals early and tightens once when the machine activates. Pressure is coherent but external: no internal fear or competing want complicates the task; escalation is a single ratchet rather than a narrowing of options. Cost is conceptual (past pain → diamonds) rather than felt on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—hidden family truth—is declared early but never materially tested; no live risk, ticking clock, or resource lost. Escalation consists of atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options. The final “keeper” role reweights identity, but because the price is off-stage (burden of painful knowledge), pressure feels moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost kinship for Liam—surfaces late (Clara’s letter) so early tension is diffuse. One meaningful deepening occurs: unsent letter + button + ribbon triangulate into a story Elara can actually deliver, narrowing her options from passive cataloging to active authorship. Cost is conceptual (nights spent, emotional exposure) rather than tangible; felt but not visible on page. Escalation is textural—dust accretion, color match—appropriate to Accumulative lens, yet lacks a beat where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“hold the line against tyranny of indifference”—is signaled early and escalates when the ledger broadcast forecloses retreat: Mara becomes hunted transmitter, not mere thief. Cost is visible: she forfeits safety and must vanish into shadows. Pressure tightens once, cleanly under causal lens; enforcers’ off-stage proximity suffices as complicating beat rather than resolving coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode or lose the prophecy—surfaces early; pressure tightens when the speck glows brighter after each monument addition, foreclosing the option to remain a mere sorter. Cost is conceptual (identity upgrade) rather than visceral, keeping the beat just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will he master time or accept mystery?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the needle steadies only if he wades into the pool, forcing a wet, literal immersion that costs dryness and certainty. No visible price recurs; stakes remain conceptual. Escalation is singular but sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear: will Elara brave the furnace to redeem the coin’s fractured intentions? The middle “step inside” beat supplies the single tightening required for short form, trading safety for knowledge. Cost is present—flames surround her—but because the visions preach rather than endanger, the price stays conceptual; we glimpse no chance of real injury or irrevocable loss. Still, agency is hers and no coincidence rescues her, satisfying baseline escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepened by each artifact found. Pressure is textural: density of murals, stories “thick in the air,” rather than narrowing options. No credible loss (time, money, danger) is dramatized; escalation is cumulative awe, not risk. Closure reweights meaning but not tactics; hence mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—is signaled early. One tightening: ceiling void reveals clock; inserting barrel forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (future now ticks unpredictably) rather than visceral; still legible on final line. Escalation is singular but coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed when she uncorks the bottle or accepts caretakership. Pressure is situational (soft clouds, gentle whispers) rather than tactical; she never weighs a visible loss or trade-off. The meaningful tightening is the reveal of the library as living, but this is an external reconfiguration, not a narrowing of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove “temporal plasticity” and reclaim self—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Empiricists seal the Hall, forcing covert entry and risk of permanent exile. Escalation causal under Causal lens: because they block, therefore she trespasses, therefore stakes heighten. Price visible: she trespasses alone, loses professional safe-ground, exits still scarred.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single dominant stake—restore stolen midnight light—is signaled early. Escalation is present: each unwind of the tether brightens the chip and narrows the task. Yet Elias faces no live trade-off or visible price (no personal loss, time squeeze, or moral sacrifice); pressure is external to the box, not internal to him. Agency is procedural (unwind, free) rather than decisive under duress, keeping escalation competent but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the unexplainable—is declared early; pressure intensifies only descriptively, not through narrowed options. No credible loss (time, safety, tool function) alters tactics; compass slips away after the climax, functioning as coda, not pivot. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tunnel opens to the lagoon, but it is a reveal, not a decision crucible. Escalation is atmospheric, satisfying the accumulative lens, yet remains low-stakes in reader gut.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—redeem past knowledge through art—surfaces early; pressure tightens when the slide’s glow reveals the passage, forcing a literal step into inherited responsibility. Agency is present (she slots the slide), but escalation is single-stage; the cost is conceptual rather than a forfeited object or bodily risk. Coincidence is avoided; the storm’s hush feels like responsive ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“can she externalize the dream?”—is signaled early; pressure is internal and accumulative rather than antagonistic. One meaningful deepening occurs inside the cathedral when the windows’ emotional density reweights the task. No visible price is dramatized (time, money, relationships) so cost remains conceptual; this caps intensity below 7.4. Agency is present but risk-free; luck does not intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—truth for the erased—signaled early. Pressure is situational: ritual等待, not escalating obstacles. One meaningful tightening: debris arrangement invites response, narrowing options to wait/flee. Cost is conceptual (time, doubt) but not viscerally paid on-page; entity arrival feels like permission, not consequence. Hence escalation is present but low-band; 6.8 reflects coherent but mild intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“breathe life back into the ghost town”—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure escalates texturally: each new lantern tightens the miracle’s reality, narrowing her option to stay. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the bottle’s glow fades just as the town stirs—proof the cost is transferring from artifact to place. Cost is visible (she forfeits rest and belonging) but not viscerally felt in body or resource; hence stops just short of 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—garden’s buried memory must be answered—signals within first 120 words and tightens once: the prophecy voice forces her from observation to ritual speech. Cost is present but diffuse: the garden’s sigh and warming air are legible, yet no concrete resource (time, social credit, bodily safety) is risked or forfeited. The silence of the foghorn complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the coincidence rule. Enough for 7+; a sharper, personal toll would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“texture of borrowed time”—stays abstract; no concrete price is paid or option foreclosed. Escalation is purely atmospheric: colors shift, warmth surges, but Elara’s agency never narrows; the beat is decorative, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will he hear the zero-hour revelation?”—tightens when the rope hums, foreclosing passive observation. Price is the tacit vow to become keeper, felt in the rain’s gentle start. Escalation is single but sufficient; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—will she answer the lantern’s call?—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: no active obstacle, resource lost, or option foreclosed. The middle beats repeat wonder rather than tighten; cost is aesthetic, not tactical. Needed one concrete renunciation (sleep, duty, fear) to escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the covenant to free the ghosts—surfaces early. Pressure deepens through accumulative discoveries rather than narrowing options; the only decisive turn is the final song, so escalation is textual, not reversible. Cost is felt as atmospheric weight, visible on the page when lights dissolve into leaf-rustle. Sufficient tightening for 600-word lyric arc, though a mid-story micro-reversal could have sharpened 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—time itself slipping—is signaled early via flickering chronometer. Escalation is single-thread: fragment → hidden chamber → temporal weaver activation; each step forecloses retreat. Agency sits with Elara (she devises the garage-sale trap, activates the weaver), but price is conceptual rather than visceral—no personal loss is shown. The tightening is coherent under causal lens yet remains intellectual; tension never becomes bodily or social.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is declared early; tightening occurs when the frayed string forces them to repair, but the cost is cooperative, not sacrificial. Agency is shared with the wanderer, diluting individual risk; no option is foreclosed for either. Pressure is situational and accumulative rather than causal; the kite’s glow is magical payoff, not consequence of prior risk. No credible loss (time, money, social credit) is dramatized, so the tightening lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—leaving a living legacy before death—is signaled early but remains abstract; no visible resource (time, strength, wire) is lost or depleted on-page. Tightening occurs only once: discovery of hollow pillars shifts task from garden tending to civilization revival, yet no further trade-off is dramatized. Cost is felt conceptually at closure but never materialized in a beat that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early; pressure accrues texturally as each artifact (dusty prints, stranger’s amber, tower glyphs) narrows interpretation toward surrender rather than analytical mastery. Single meaningful deepening at the pedestal reweights knowledge: homecoming is experiential, not extractable. Felt cost is conceptual (loss of explanatory certainty) not visceral, capping escalation at 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—garden vs. battlefield—remains abstract; no live obstacle or resource limit appears. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; no option is foreclosed. Cost is postponed to an imagined future.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—can the wasteland still speak?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: wax leaf warms, symbols glow, amber darkens. The tightening is purely perceptual; no concrete resource, relationship, or safety is risked, so cost remains abstract. Agency resides in a single crank-turn; luck delivers the cylinder and the revelation, limiting escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sky-amending stake is declared early but remains abstract; the “wrong” colors are never felt as bodily threat. One meaningful tightening arrives at the chessboard, yet the spire’s unseen opponent never raises the cost of losing; victory feels pre-ordained. Agency is present—Kael’s queen-sacrifice triggers the reveal—but price is conceptual, not visceral. Closure reweights meaning, but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: will Elara keep collecting others’ pain as shield or confess her own? Pressure accumulates through iterative listening/walking rather than causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens. Middle turn is the joint spelling of “forgiveness”—first time she authors, not archives, a gesture—narrowing her future stance. Cost is present (she forecloses the safety of detached performance), yet not viscerally paid on page (no lost relationship, physical toll, or public exposure), so escalation feels moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early; pressure escalates through pattern deepening (symbol glow, corridor shift) rather than narrowing options. The storm works as Accumulative intensifier, but no tangible resource is risked or lost; the cost is emotional release, not foreclosed option. The single meaningful tightening is the moment stone floats and language returns; it reweights identity but does not test Elara with a trade-off. Agency is contemplative, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can forgiveness be refracted into bearable pieces?—tightens through each poetic iteration that visibly alters the environment. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. The meaningful deepening occurs when shadows of the wronged appear, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (heart-shard surrendered) but legible, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve identity before memory dissolves—signalled in paragraph one. Escalation delivered through one tightening: successful alignment triggers hull rupture/acid surge, narrowing choice to flee or stay. Protagonist agency drives turn; no external rescue. Cost visible—floor tilts, sea roars, survival odds plummet—yet she chooses endangerment to protect newly quilted self.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—creating something timeless—signals early and tightens once: the oasis discovery reframes the seashell effort as insufficient. Agency is creative decision, not external opposition; the tightening is cognitive, a deepening under Accumulative lens. No visible price beyond internal “tremble”; cost is emotional, not tactile, keeping the score mid-band. Enough escalation for length, but stakes never threaten tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers > shouts”—is declared early but never tested by an opposing shout or consequence for silence; no option is foreclosed. Pressure is static mood: heat ends, cool arrives, woman appears without resistance or cost. No credible loss (job, secrecy, physical danger) is risked or paid; the tightening is purely lyrical repetition of scent/image. Escalation is accumulative texture, but without price the tension stays ambient.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (“bring the lost home”) are declared early but never narrowed; each midnight call identical, no escalation of risk or resource scarcity. The single turning point—first traveler appears—occurs off Mara’s active decision, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are personal/psychic safety vs. relic contamination; pressure tightens once when truth blurts, again when ritual cost (loss of control) is accepted. Escalation is single but meaningful: the eye’s warmth/cold shift literalizes the narrowing. No credible external antagonist, yet the orchard itself becomes pressure vessel; cost is the surrender of absolute rational control, legible in final smile. Agency stays active—Elias decides to seek, to recite, to re-bury—so causal agency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will Elias accept custodianship of alien memories?—signalled on page 1. One meaningful deepening: discovery of journal moves puzzle from flower to full life story, tightening obligation. Cost is present but abstract (lifelong caretaking); no tangible sacrifice on page keeps it from 8.8 band. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: each found object thickens atmospheric weight and moral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—will Elias accept guardianship of the doorway—emerges late but is signaled by the hum and ant trail. Escalation is situational: each apparition (chip, ants, archway, map) narrows refusal options. The price is conceptual: lifelong vigilance implied but not dramatized. A second tightening beat (e.g., temptation to abandon) is missing, so pressure plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    Early stake (unravel dream) is clear; pressure tightens only via ominous atmosphere rather than narrowing options; the starlight-entity’s revelation is a single beat that flips her goal but does not test or foreclose an alternative path, so escalation is present yet lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freezing a living moment—tightens once: the shell’s glow envelops them, foreclosing retreat. Agency is Elara’s chant and Kael’s consenting touch; coincidence never rescues. Cost is the irreversibility of the succeeded experiment; no second take is possible. Under causal lens the tightening is single but sufficient: the present becomes a world “unto itself,” options narrowed to eternal carry.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Elara re-humanize a world she can no longer scent? Pressure tightens when the screw’s history is revealed, forcing her either to keep yearning for smell or embrace “occluded views.” The meaningful turn is her deliberate handing-back of the screw and the internal vow to read silence—options narrow, cost is the permanent loss of olfactory identity. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 750-word scale; no reversal for Mira, yet Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will fear or mastery rule the next stroke—tightens when crystallization threatens to derail the ceremony. One meaningful deepening: revisiting superstition is not nostalgia but tactical grounding that narrows options to “face it or fail.” Cost is legible: the quill’s reversion is simultaneous with her audible breath, making the price physiological. No external coincidence; storm recedes only after internal shift, satisfying causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—tightens once when the bottle’s hum forces the current-channeling choice; orchard clock is felt but not ticking minute-by-minute. Escalation is emotional, not external: pressure moves from static regret to embodied current-release, narrowing her option to metaphysical action. Cost is legible—she forfeits the bottle’s weight/hold and accepts the scent’s permanent stain. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—cosmic illusion versus personal cost—is declared early but never tightens; escalation is atmospheric (glow, tremor, hush) rather than option-narrowing. No visible price is exacted from the witness; the resolution arrives as beneficent epiphany, so pressure feels cosmic-scale abstract, not personal-trade-off sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Elias find what clocks truly measure?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is single but meaningful: backward count intensifies risk (ritual trespass) and literally drops the key into the hidden slot, foreclosing the safety of routine measurement. Cost is legible: the parchment’s decree collapses his occupational premise; the whistle’s second blow is no longer institutional but personal, a visible forfeit of his former role.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unauthorized entry—deflates once the intruder proves benevolent; tension shifts to abstract theme without new external risk. No meaningful tightening: options do not narrow, no tool or stamina is lost, no legal or social cost surfaces. Agency is receptive (accept mushroom) rather than decisive, so escalation is affective, not causal, under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father—signals early; pressure tightens only narratively (“she realized…”) rather than through an on-page obstacle or trade-off. No reversal or resource lost; escalation is atmospheric. The final write-out crystallizes stance but does not foreclose a live option or incur visible price. Sufficient for a quiet lyric arc, yet below the 8.2 threshold where cost would charge the image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—break isolation vs. preserve safe distance—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when humming callers force Eli to play the disc; that moment forecloses continued estrangement. Cost is visceral: trembling fingers, exhaustion at dawn. Escalation is causal: each call repeats the melody, heightening the pressure to respond; no coincidence resolves the knot. The disc’s note is the decisive tool-turn that makes the final call possible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—alleviate existential loneliness—stays abstract; no concrete option is ever foreclosed. Pressure does not escalate: the clock’s activation is accidental, the doubles welcome rather than test her, and no resource (time, stamina, social credit) is risked. The single “tightening” is the station’s temporal shift, but it complicates nothing and demands no tactical response. Because reciprocity is declared rather than dramatized as a cost, the conflict remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—map her own heart—signaled early. Pressure tightens when melody insists; option to retreat is foreclosed by “quiet blaze of determination.” Accumulative escalation: each absorbed language raises emotional density until distilled into single note. Cost visible: she forfeits external cartography for internal, a trade-off legible in last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“uncover the truth, no matter how unsettling”—is declared early. Escalation is single but sufficient: the void forces her to choose between recording and repairing; the pen’s warmth signals rising cost. Price is visible in the final image: anomaly shrinks, pen dies, implying irreversible edit. No secondary reversal, yet the causal narrowing satisfies 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prove silence holds meaning—surfaces early and tightens through each gestural beat; the camera-click supplies the single decisive intensification. Because the world is empty, external opposition is absent; pressure is purely existential, acceptable under Accumulative lens but caps visceral cost. Escalation is a density swell, not a narrowing of options; the price is conceptual, not tactical. Sufficient for this length, yet short of the visible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“whispers > shouts”—is declared early but only implicitly tested: the labyrinth whispers, thewall yields to a quiet key-turn, yet Eli does not suffer a shouted alternative. Escalation is present (wall rises, storm peaks) but agency is reactive; Mira supplies the lock, Eli merely inserts. No tangible forfeiture (time, injury, social credit) is risked or lost. Pressure tightens situationally yet options never fork between shout-path and whisper-path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can the stranger relinquish the half-spoken secret. Escalation is textural: each shutter adjustment tightens ambient symbolism until mirror-reflection forces confrontation. No external antagonist; pressure is situational—stillness vs. disclosure. Cost is the stranger’s vulnerability and the guardian’s absorbed sorrow; guardian’s endurance forecloses reciprocal comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is declared, but on-page pressure is limited to townspeople pausing; no credible loss or forfeiture alters Elias’s tactics. Escalation is a single summarized intensification: displays glow, people stop. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence is absent, yet agency is observational, not interventionist. Cost is aesthetic (lonely watcher) not practical, keeping tension in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stake—“find freedom in embracing true nature”—stays abstract; no external obstacle or forfeiture sharpens it. Pressure escalates only atmospherically: whale call grows louder, island rises, but Elara’s options never narrow, nor does she risk anything tangible. Dropping the scrimshaw is symbolic surrender, not a trade-off that costs her later moves. Coincidence (island surfaces) legs the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—private grief vs mandated joy—tightens once: the heart is finished and placed in view, crystallizing risk. Escalation is textural: each wood shaving adds density to the silence until the final object makes refusal tangible. No external enforcer appears, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; cost is felt but not compounded by new obstacle. Sufficient for the length, yet lacks a mid-scene spike that would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—permission to transcend artistic boundaries—is signaled early but never materially tested; no external resistance or internal fear complicates the recital. The single escalation is the ice cracking upward, a beautiful Accumulative intensification, yet it imposes no tactical cost or narrowing of options for the poet.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—trading awakenings to perceive beauty without color—is declared early and reiterated, but escalation is gentle: each plant barter succeeds, reed revival is effortless, glassblower’s praise is gentle. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the only “tightening” is conceptual (he realizes essence suffices). Because success feels assured, tension plateaus rather than spikes. Cost is abstract (former desire to see color abandoned), never dramatized as loss or forfeiture on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are announced—“remind humanity of its shared heritage”—but never localize into a personal cost or external obstacle Elara must overcome. The sound sequence presents historical ironies, yet each is accordioned into summary; no single auditory fragment threatens her goal or demands a tactical response. Without a tightening choice or forfeiture, pressure plateaus; the final “renewal” lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will she graft his science of decay onto her own life?—tightens when the curtains illuminate and the stencil activates; the price is the permanent tattoo that commits her to public, bodily synthesis of botany and jewelry. One meaningful escalation suffices, but the origami coordinates function more as mood than active pressure, so the tightening is present yet soft.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—prove the crash was engineered—tightens when Elara weaponizes the measuring tape to calibrate the theft. One meaningful deepening: Tower card reweighted from omen to blueprint, foreclosing the option that collapse was accident. Cost is conceptual but legible: the city’s hollow pulse becomes their new map.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge at cost of sanity”—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when she whispers the purification word and the pagoda fractures; option space narrows from deciphering to being permeated. Cost is felt: innocence ends, sanity risk acknowledged. Agency is partly passive—light envelops her—but the beat is renunciation of former goal (unlock civilization) for new stance (carry memories within). Could use slightly more tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—giving form to forgotten dreams—tightens once when Elara presses stone to vial, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (she shoulders collective sorrow), but the price isn’t felt in body or resource; hence withheld from 8.8+. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: each glowing object intensifies pattern until murky vial breaks it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—can she still trust her vocation after the con—announced early, but pressure is ambient memory, not an on-page test: no live option is foreclosed, no creature or visitor forces a decision. The single “tightening” is the symbolic rearrangement of tools; escalation is tonal layering, not rising risk. Cost is interior ambiance, not observable forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the key to her forgotten self”—is signaled early; pressure escalates only through atmospheric intensification (whispers grow louder, tunnel darkens) rather than narrowing options. A single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes scars belong to the miracle, not just her; this reframes pain but does not test or cost her anything on-page. Agency is largely receptive; coincidence (second hourglass exists) provides resolution. Cost is lyrically implied (scars fade) yet not paid by her decision, so escalation is textural, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“restore the vibrancy of her fading village”—is declared early but never tested on-page; no consequence of failure appears. Pressure escalates only atmospherically: aurora swells, symbols glow, astrolabe trembles, yet Lira’s agency stays internal/resting; no option is foreclosed or tactic altered. The tightening is cadence shift, not causal turn. Cost is aesthetic/epiphanic, not tactical, capping intensity in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—cultivate sparks—remains thematic until the final beat; no intermediate obstacle tests or narrows Mara’s options. Escalation is atmospheric (archive dims) rather than agency-driven; the revival is achieved by presenting the clock, not by a trade-off or renunciation. Pressure is coherent under Situational lens but never tightens; the archive’s revival feels like a密钥 rather than a cost. No visible price is exacted from Mara, so the high-band cost gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“will insight come?”—signaled early; tightening occurs when gear vibration redirects wander to purposive search. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: he forfeits exit, embracing guardianship. Agency present but soft; machine activation is more discovery than decision, limiting escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“price of tranquility vs. chaos”—is signaled early and tightened once: piano chord breaks unpardonable silence, renouncing absolute safety. No credible loss is dramatized (no guard chases, no exile threat), so cost stays conceptual. Escalation is textural: density of silence metaphors increases until pattern snaps into sound. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but lacks a visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—expose pretender—is clear early. Escalation is told in summary strings (“messages grew bolder”) rather than on-page reversals that foreclose options; the ledger/diary/speech placements are listed, not dramatized. One visible cost: pretender’s frantic annotations, but Elara pays none. Agency stays abstract—no moment where a message fails or forces her tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is declared early; pressure escalates via sensory accumulation (hum volume, star vibrancy) rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off or visible price is exacted; the stone circle gifts revelation gratis. Agency is receptive (she kneels, peers, accepts cosmic thread) rather than active gambit. Result: a poetic deepening that satisfies the accumulative lens but stays below high-band cost threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—restore culture via embryo—signals early. One meaningful tightening: guard blocks path, then steps aside, but the reversal is external and frictionless. Escalation is primarily atmospheric (steam, light) rather than option-narrowing; no credible loss alters tactics. Closure lands with visible spectacle yet minimal personal cost, meeting the word-scale threshold but not the 8.8 charge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“keep the photo or let grief win”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalated when wind + cliff threaten to finish the drone’s erasure. The slip forces a literal freeze that converts survival reflex into creative act, narrowing future options to “carry memory as art.” Cost is visible: she forsakes immediate flight-safety to crawl toward the void, then forsakes privacy by leaving the sketch behind—two tangible prices.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can she paint/live again after creative fracture?”—tightens once: from static despair to active re-sorting. The deepening is internal, but options visibly narrow: keep broken box → ascend without it. Cost is conceptual (loss of grandmother’s container) yet felt. Agency is decision-based; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence absent. Meets 8.8+ gate but lacks a second, sharper price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake—uncover ink’s secret to explain brother’s death—stays coherent. Middle tightening: ink reveals irreversible past rather than controllable future, foreclosing her revenge-fantasy option. Price is grief re-experienced, but external pressure is moderate (no ticking clock or antagonist), keeping escalation just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“provoke an unspoken conversation”—is clear early, but the only escalation is the off-stage system alert; no visible trap or forfeiture materializes on the page. Elara’s agency is binary: she downloads or she doesn’t; no intermediate adaptation, lost tool, or rising penalty. The scandal is deferred to the future, so the beat lacks a present-tense cost that narrows options now. One meaningful tightening occurs, but it is narrative shorthand rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: protect sanctuary without bloodshed. Tightening occurs when Kael offers the blade—pacifist path narrows to “armed neutrality.” Cost is legible: she shoulders the psychological weight of potential violence, shown by fingertips on the scabbard at dusk. escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“catch the echo”—is clear; pressure escalates texturally via sensory density rather than narrowing options. The goddess’s appearance is gift, not test; Kael’s agency is receptive (listen) rather than decisive trade-off. Cost is conceptual but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping escalation just inside the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prime stake—exposing clandestine surveillance—arrives early and tightens when Eleanor re-aims the telescope, foreclosing silent complicity. Pressure escalates through data accumulation rather than direct threat; the vanished journalist implies danger but stays off-page, muting visceral cost. One clear micro-turn satisfies lens, yet stakes never test her physically or socially in-scene, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s guilt-roar—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when letters force confrontation. Escalation is psychological: each forged reply increases the risk of self-exposure while reducing the internal din. Cost is legible: the final silence arrives with emptied hands and a new fragility (“hands no longer steady”). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and culminates in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—find meaning in the unlearning—tightens when the mandala reveals the silenced people’s self-chosen hush, foreclosing easy answers. Escalation is pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual (she must carry the unease as guide). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, sufficient for 600-word frame. Could use a sharper tangible loss to enter 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared—make mercy normal—but no external pressure opposes Elara; the only obstacle is the damaged mosaic itself. Escalation is textural: each tessera placed adds weight rather than risk. A single micro-turn occurs when she sees the gleaming fragment as “key,” but it narrows no live option. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; the price of her labor is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“lure possibility from the brink”—is signaled in para 1; pressure tightens when the coin’s colors mirror the woman’s storm, forcing Mara to risk absorption of despair. The single meaningful turn is the coin transfer; it narrows Mara’s option to remain aloof and visibly costs her spectral energy (“warmth spread through her…”). Escalation is accumulative/image-driven rather than causal-chain; stakes stay personal, not cosmic. Cost is legible but externalized in garden light rather than a price that will haunt future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—heal fractured telepathic links—arrives early and tightens once: she must finish the painting before dawn. No external opposition; pressure is self-imposed deadline and residual static unease. Escalation is accretive (light layers) rather than a reversal. Cost is felt fatigue, but no option is foreclosed—hence stops just below 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“uncover forgotten history”—is declared early; pressure accumulates via pattern breaks in the heat-maps, not via narrowing options Elara must trade off. The fossil’s float is a coincidence that complicates; it never threatens loss or demands adaptation. The final beat reweights meaning but does not foreclose a live alternative; she gains purpose without paying a visible price. Under Accumulative lens this is sufficient for mild escalation, yet lacks the visible price required for 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—“unscramble the canyon echo into usable prophecy”—are declared early and tighten once: when the bone button is pressed to glass, the option to walk away is foreclosed. The cost (jar’s silence = echo spent) is legible but not viscerally felt; we are told Elara feels “charged,” not shown a forfeiture that alters her next move. Under Accumulative lens the density increase is sufficient, yet the absence of a live trade-off keeps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    A single stake—reclaiming courage—tightens via dwindling codes and winter’s thaw. The final choice is renunciation (pill unswallowed) foreclosing retreat; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Pressure accumulates under lens; one clear cadence shift suffices. Visceral loss (time, blood, tool) would sharpen cost legibility for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—decode promise before gutters cease—signaled early. But escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: fog lifts, figure delivers answer, time expires without protagonist action narrowing options. No visible cost or foreclosed path; pressure remains ambient, not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why kindness preserves place—tightens when each alignment of light deletes another comfortable isolation option for Elara. Agency is sustained: she chooses to follow, to reveal, to teach; each act narrows her retreat back to solitary potter. Visible cost: she forfeits the anonymity of observer, now bound to maintain the glass’s pulse for the village. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—will Elara connect or stay solitary?—is declared early but pressure stays atmospheric, never tightening her options. No concrete loss (time, social risk, plant jeopardy) is hazarded; the rose petal and bitting gauge work as mood cues, not irreversible triggers. The lockmaster’s arrival complicates nothing; their convergence feels pre-ordained, so agency never escalates. One gentle micro-turn—handing over the tooth—changes symbolism, not tactics, yielding only a hush rather than a price.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find the universal thread—tightens through pattern-density, not external opposition. The deepening is the gradual recognition that every reflected image is a filament; the tightening comes when she sees the groove and realizes the spiral is not hers to keep. Cost is relinquishment, visible on the page. One meaningful escalation under an accumulative lens suffices.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of communion: to touch the web of everything you must surrender the private talisman that first let you feel it. No moral is stated; the final image of the empty groove glinting with sky reconfigures value. Subtext resides in the act of letting go—what looks like loss is actually access. The whispered quiet invites counter-readings (solitude vs. fusion) without forcing them.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the station and her agency—tightens when sponsor flight is spelled; the counter-frequency act narrows her options to pariah status. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens: each because/therefore step raises social cost. No coincidence rescues; campus protests complicate, not solve. Price is visible: static silence bought with community schism.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key, survive confinement—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when walls begin to close. The reversal (contracting chamber) is physically manifest and forces her to “embrace mutiny,” paying a visible cost (claustrophobic panic vs. expanded space). Agency sits squarely on her shoulder: she chooses to push through the narrow throat and later to accept the spatial rewrite. Cost is legible; still, the mutiny concept stays slightly abstract, keeping the score just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—awaken empathy for Lila via art—is signaled early; the tightening beat is the silhouette offering a matching ribbon, forcing Elara to test her method against live menace. Cost is present (solitude, archival erasure, possible stalker) but remains conceptual rather than visceral; the price is “lighter heart,” not irreversible loss, keeping the entry just shy of 8.8. Agency is inventive: she forecloses pursuit in favor of portraiture, a credible artist’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“restore erased legacy or let it stay buried”—is signaled early and escalates through each decoded stanza. The tightening beat is the ritual choice: speak the name, release the exiles, accept that history will rewrite itself. Cost is conceptual (loss of secrecy, station awakened) rather than tangible; still legible under CR lens. No coincidence resolves the turn; agency remains Elara’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single stake: decode the flake and find what the hitchhiker sought. Pressure escalates only by walking farther; no narrowing options, resource loss, or external obstacle raises cost. The final “sanctuary” reveal is a lucky match, not a tightening trade-off, so escalation remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why his father’s path keeps circling back—is signaled early and tightens when Lila’s journal reveals the startup collapse. Agency is mostly observational; the only fork is the verbal dissuasion of the scavenger, which succeeds too easily to feel costly. Pressure accumulates via pattern (markers, bills, journal) rather than rising jeopardy. The final image reweights meaning, but the lack of a live trade-off keeps escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake is decoding the inscription to heal herself, signaled early. Pressure accrues via pattern recognition rather than narrowing options; the star-pattern revelation deepens meaning but does not foreclose an alternative path or extract a visible price. No tangible resource—time, social credit, bodily safety—is risked or lost. Escalation is informational, not tactical; the protagonist’s stance toward her past softens, yet the shift is announced, not paid for with an on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—tightens exactly once: the seed forces confession, foreclosing lifelong self-erasure. Escalation is situational pressure, not multiple reversals; sufficient at this length. The price (public self-accusation) is on-page and alters her stance forever. No secondary stake clutters the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“mend the shattered covenant”—is signaled early and tightened when maze hedges literally close in. Agency is continuous: each step is a decision to advance despite thorn-catch. Cost is present but diffuse: glowing scars and cloak snags stand in for bodily price; deeper personal consequence (permanent root-binding? memory loss?) stays hinted, not nailed. Still, one clear escalation beat satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mend souls vs. reclaim own freedom—signals early and tightens once: the root-pattern warning forces her to confront the bill. Agency is present but soft; she declares endurance rather than tests an alternative path. Cost is conceptual (eternal binding) rather than tactile; at this length that suffices under Accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—purpose after applause—tightens once via pattern intensification: each echo metaphor increases felt hollowness until the pocketing reverses valence. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. Cost is conceptual (must self-fill void) rather than tangible, but legible on page. Could wish for one sharper external complication, yet meets 8.8− band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—understand transition—signalled early; pressure escalates only once when seed sprouts and visions flood in. No narrowing of options or trade-off is dramatized; the tree simply gives the answer. Cost is conceptual (“work continues”) but not viscerally felt, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—restoration of cognitive order—signaled early; the tightening is the single orb dissolution that reweights rune patterns, foreclosing endless cataloguing. Cost is conceptual: town must live in new identity map; Elara forfeits certainty, not comfort. Agency resides in ritual act, not confrontation; sufficient under Accumulative lens though pressure stays cerebral. No credible personal loss or stamina drain visible, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will she heed the call or finish the inspection—is signaled early but never materially tested; no clock, no external obstacle, no forfeiture. Pressure escalates texturally: each step brightens the pearl, narrowing focus rather than options. Cost is aesthetic (shared voices) not personal. Agency is present—she inserts the pearl—but the price lands on abstract “walls between hearts,” not on her concrete circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness via mapping—is signaled in graffiti and tightened when her own map is unfolded; the option to remain merely an observer is foreclosed. Agency is present: she chooses to play the single note, trace her own lines, accept the ache. Cost is conceptual but legible: the “raw ache of unfiltered memory” is the price of continuing. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find the unspoken word that explains her summoning—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens when the library demands transcription. Escalation is textural: each shelf thickens the cipher’s hum, narrowing her options to listen or be overwhelmed. Agency is present—she writes—but the cost is symbolic (she becomes “conduit”) rather than viscerally felt; no credible loss of time, identity, or safety lands on the page. The tightening is coherent under Accumulative lens, yet the price remains abstract, capping entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—arrives early and tightens through the coffee-stain glimpses; each swirl forecloses false comfort. Escalation is textural: plant whispers grow urgent, stains darken from abstract to arboreal, violin hum accelerates from curiosity to weapon. The single decisive release (playing the violin) pays the accumulating dread, but the price (instrument dies, ache remains) is stated more than dramatized, keeping the score just shy of 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is clear; pressure tightens when the revived traveler reframes the goal to “stillness endures,” forcing Elara to relinquish her method. Yet the reversal is externally authored; Elara’s agency is reception, not a decision that narrows options with visible price. Cost is conceptual (loss of former purpose) but not dramatized—no tool breaks, no relationship severed, no irrevocable act. Escalation is single-turn, adequate for lyric short-form but not viscerally punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared—“find the source of contentment”—but remain abstract; no visible forfeiture or narrowing of options occurs. Pressure is atmospheric (mist, glow, visions) rather than tactical; Elara does not relinquish a concrete want to gain peace. The lake sequence deepens knowledge, not cost, so escalation is textural only; the final beat reconfigures meaning but carries no felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—free Mara from absolutism—is signaled early and narrows to the single decisive act of mailing the shard. Pressure escalates texturally: each chime phrase thickens the interpretive load until Elias commits to his reading and seals the letter. Cost is conceptual but legible—he gives away his diagnostic prop, foreclosing future “conscience” work with that shard. No reversal or external antagonist, yet the internal tightening suffices for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stake—reveal the backwards-aging secret—remains abstract; no external consequence (funding, reputation, relationships on the page) is risked. Escalation is lyric, not causal: each ripple deepens texture but does not narrow her tactical options or force irreversible choice. The final speech is delivered in serene summary; no one interrupts, no price is exacted. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens, so the dominant stake never becomes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the arrowhead’s purpose—tightens when the flock’s pattern converts weapon to compass, foreclosing physical travel in favor of internal stillness. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible; pressure is coherent but muted because no external antagonist or resource is risked.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove manual magic matters”—is declared early but abstract; pressure is situational (colliding walls) rather than causal or accruing. One meaningful tightening: walls close, harness/mist gambit becomes the only path, paid for by transient terror. Cost is visible (panic, disorientation) yet not persistent; no future constraint or social price lingers. Escalation is single-step, adequate for 700-word scope but not reinvested at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—to discover “the color of sound”—is declared late and remains metaphorical, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is accretive: each glow layers mystique until the vow crystallizes; this is legitimate under Accumulative lens but thin on visible price. No option is foreclosed; Elias gains a quest without losing or risking anything on-page. Enough tightening for mid-band, but lacks a tangible trade-off to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“can she wring meaning from contraction?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens exactly once when the first coin’s immersion forecloses the option to walk away. Escalation is causal under lens; cost is conceptual (sole responsibility for rebirth) rather than visceral, but legible on page. A second tightening beat is absent, keeping tension lyrical rather than crucible-hot.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover purpose after failing one soul—surfaces early and tightens through the accretion of whispered sacrifices. The single meaningful deepening occurs when naming the monsters crystallizes her stance; options narrow from wandering to re-engaged reaper. Cost is visible in the tremor she speaks through and the now-anchored atlas she must carry. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates twice, keeping the score below 8.5, but the final image forecloses despair, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake— restoring planetary motion via bell— is signaled early; escalation is textural: droplet rhythm intensifies emotionally until the first wave tightens the cadence. No tactical trade-off is forced; the cost is symbolic (visible scar). Agency is present yet gentle—Eliard’s endurance succeeds on first attempt without setback that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—town’s amnesia versus reclamation—is signaled early and tightens when each photograph forces Elias closer to public exposure. One meaningful reversal: private night vigil becomes communal daylight reckoning, cost paid in his vulnerability to crowd emotion. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-turn, fitting Accumulative lens; pressure stays legible. A sharper price—say, an elder’s anger or official pushback—would have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (harmonize logic & intuition) is declared, yet pressure never tightens; the crystal is found, not fought for, and the flame poses no risk. No option is narrowed, no price exacted; escalation is purely decorative. Stake remains static, satisfying itself with imagery rather than irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“to decipher the chaos and restore order” with trust on the line—is declared early; pressure mounts atmospherically (static clears, clouds form pattern) rather than through narrowing tactical options. The single meaningful turn is cognitive: the pattern is “finally revealed,” but the protagonist does not sacrifice, renounce, or risk tangible loss—triumph feels predetermined. Cost is conceptual (the burden continues) rather than felt on-page, so escalation stays in mid-band. Agency is observational, not decisional, which suits an Accumulative lens but keeps tension abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim feeling—signaled in para-2; tightens when swords force Kael to choose integrate-or-lose. Agency visible: Kael strikes, parries, decides shatter; luck never rescues. Cost is felt skin-level (glass shards, emotional flood) and conceptually (now houses former self). No secondary stake dilution; history-rewrite outside is texture, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard whatever this seed represents”—is declared early and escalates when key-glow pulls him to water, foreclosing the option to keep the object above ground. Cost is present but lightweight: a warm key and a creaking door; no credible loss (time, reputation, safety) is dramatized. Agency is continuous—planting, studying, relinquishing—so escalation passes causal test, yet pressure never becomes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each escalating gust that macerates stillness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tunnel’s echo warms, foreclosing the option to quit before laughter returns. Agency is cumulative/textural: Eli’s endurance, not a single decision, pays the price. Cost is felt in cracked voice and warm handle; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—library safety vs. return home—signaled in paragraph three and tightened when keeper prices the bargain. Escalation is single but meaningful: the return door opens at the cost of destroying her current anchor. Agency is renunciation rather than action, yet it forecloses the only evident escape, leaving her in perpetual ache. Cost is declared, not viscerally dramatized, keeping score just below 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    A single dominant stake—escape failure identity—signals early; pressure tightens only once via the crozier-planting act that forecloses return to old methods. Escalation is textural (glowing nexus, trembling earth) rather than causal; options never visibly narrow before the sapling appears. The visible cost is the crozier’s dissolution, but it is not framed as a sacrifice Elara understands she’s paying. Stakes therefore feel conceptual, not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is conceptual: prove silence is fertile, not void. One tightening occurs when the shard dims—Elara realizes the “finite tool” misbelief—yet the reversal is narrated summary, not a choice that costs her an option. Agency is interpretive (tuning) rather than risk-bearing; no resource is spent, deadline missed, or path foreclosed. Pressure is lyric, not tactical; under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies and flips meaning, satisfying minimal escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the ferry—remains clear; pressure tightens when the transient warns “the timelines will destroy you,” foreclosing the safe option. Yet the actual complication is narrated rather than tested: we are told she is “stretched thin” but see no beat-level tactical sacrifice or reversible loss. The final reset carries conceptual cost, but escalation lacks an on-page fork where Mara must abandon an alternate benefit, keeping the conflict emotionally mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—connection via weave—tightens when the shadow-man’s warning forecloses safety: “what if it unravels you?” Escalation is textural: each pattern intensifies gallery volatility until the environment literally dissolves; cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but still felt. No secondary reversal, yet the deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Could use one visceral consequence (blood on thread, dizzy spell) to hit 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will humanity keep looking upward—surfaces early and tightens when the Council threatens to dismantle the towers. Elara’s agency centers the escalation: she mounts the chain as pedestal, recruits students, and hybridizes star/alien charts, narrowing her own safety margin with the Council. Cost is social and ideological rather than bodily; the ending reweights the stake by showing towers lit with alien data, their survival bought at the price of human interpretive supremacy. A hair more visceral jeopardy would push it higher, but the conceptual price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“protect this voice”—is signaled early; escalation is accumulative: each pulse thickens atmosphere rather than narrows tactical options. Agency is observational (follow, study, slip into satchel) rather than decisional; no live option is foreclosed. Cost is atmospheric, not tangible; price never alters her physical ability or future path. Tightening deepens mood but does not test commitment or risk loss.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—retrieve codex to see the unseen—tightens when walls literally close and water rises, forcing a speed trade-off. Phase jump is the single meaningful turn that reweights the mission from recovery to acceptance of invisible limits. Cost is conceptual (she gives up control), visible on-page as fleck dims. Escalation is linear but coherent under causal lens; no secondary reversal is needed at this length.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of respectful unknowing emerges through image, not slogan: cables as ancient veins, fleck as warning lamp. Final reconfiguration—choosing to leave part of reality unmapped—avains mechanical summary and lands via the hush-of-waves image. No thematic echo penalties; the concept stays implicit. Some symbolic freight (tidal breath = her panic) edges close to overt but remains anchored in action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove she is alive—signaled first paragraph. Single escalation: defragment narrows options to “assemble or stay erased,” visible cost in sleepless cold and dissolved ink. Agency sits at keyboard; physical risk off-page. Stakes visceral yet intellectual; cost conceptual, not tangible loss—keeps it below 8.2 ceiling for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the dying language—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each echo beat adds sonic density until the only path is to surrender stamina to the diamond. The tightening is singular but decisive: “the diamond responded… energy draining her with every word.” Cost is legible on-page—collapse, faded veins—under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove theory / recover colleague—signaled in paragraph 1. One tightening: phone command “Metamorphose. Now.” forces Lena from hunter to participant. Cost legible: she forfeits control, embracing absurdity. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (quake) complicates but does not resolve. No second reversal needed at this length; escalation coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—orchard’s life vs. mechanical order—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when heartbeat-sync forecloses retreat. Escalation is driven by her agency (shell pressed to chest, bow steady on swaying bridge) with visible cost: statues dissolve, shell light dies. One tightening suffices; no reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“deliver hope across a lethal border”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each scanner pass until the truce clearing forces the final hand-off. Escalation is purely causal: patrol drone chase → crevice dive → truce flag, each beat raising capture cost. The storm’s calming release is earned by Elias’s successful smuggle, not luck; the visible price is his permanent self-exile from neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence birth living art?—is signaled early and tightens once: he must either stay mute or sing to animate the horses. Escalation is situational pressure rather than causal chain; the oasis appears by wind-bell lure, not prior intent, so agency is reactive. Yet the final song is an active, costly stance crystallization, satisfying closure. Persistent constraint (pendant now sings against his chest) foreshadows future exposure, keeping stakes alive.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“protect the living story-realm”—is signaled early and deepens when she sees it fraying. Escalation is textural: each geometric pattern intensifies scent, light, and scarf vibration, reweighting the stake from curiosity to custodial duty. Yet the tightening is gentle; no concrete resource (time, stamina, social credit) is visibly forfeited, keeping cost legible but abstract. The final guardianship is acceptance, not sacrifice, so pressure plateaus just below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the fettered idea—is signaled early; pressure escalates via vault resistance and glowing hair, but the stakes remain cosmic-generic (“save or destroy”) rather than personally priced. Agency is present—key-turn, phrase-whisper, orb-shatter—yet no credible loss (tool, stamina, social credit) is dramatized; the only cost is asserted future risk off-page. One visible tightening: lock yields; options narrow from possibility to irreversible release, satisfying short-form requirement. Because the price is conceptual rather than felt, ceiling stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—tightens when the missing mushroom gap is literalized; the locket trade-off (knowledge vs. stable past) is legible. Escalation is single-step rather than iterative, but under an Accumulative lens the density jump suffices. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral; we feel the shift yet lose no tool or chance. Enough for 7+; a concrete forfeiture would breach 8.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—free the reversible exile—signals early and tightens once: the shadow’s edges soften only after she commits words to parchment, foreclosing her prior neutrality. Cost is conceptual but legible: the mirror flips from ‘prison’ to ‘bridge’, stripping her of the safety of distance. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational, crystallized in her stance shift. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—“preserve wonder”—is announced early but never sharpened by measurable loss or opposition; nothing is actually at risk. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens: the ritual proceeds on schedule, the sprout glows, wonder is affirmed. No trade-off or felt price narrows her options, so escalation under the Accumulative lens remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—free the spirits—tightens as each knot refusal raises spectral resistance; Accumulative escalation is coherent. One meaningful deepening: the stubborn penultimate knot forces Elara to whisper plea, revealing her own need for grounding. Cost is felt in the sagging net and her trembling hands; options narrow from restoration to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will the chapel remain silent forever?”—is signaled early and tightens once: discovery of misalignment converts abstract quest into urgent dig. Agency is continuous; every shovel stroke forecloses the option to walk away. Cost accumulates in time, fatigue, and the irreversible exposure of the site to future crowds. Under causal lens the escalation is clean, but the final price is more conceptual than visceral; no tool breaks or physical toll appears on page, capping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“to understand letting go”—is signaled early and narrowed by each artifact; every discovery threatens her reflex to catalogue and keep. Meaningful tightening occurs when the sailor’s letter re-prices the globe from treasure to lesson; this single deepening forces her final renunciation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: density of unfinished narratives accumulates emotional cost rather than external jeopardy. The price (leaving the globe behind) is visible and irreversible inside the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes—free the ghost / prove her own voice—are signaled early but remain abstract; no tangible resource (time, lute string, battery) is risked or lost. Pressure rises atmospherically rather than through narrowed choices; the graffiti and plate cooperate too smoothly, so options don’t foreclose. Cost is spiritual, not on-page; the ghost’s gratitude is felt but Elara forfeits nothing visible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“to mirror the sky inside walls”—is declared early; pressure tightens when blank pages resist her fractal reading. Escalation is textural: each star impression adds density until the constellation is internalized; no external antagonist or reversal needed. Cost is the building’s final shudder, felt rather than negotiated; no tactical loss (tool, time, social credit) alters her method. Sufficient for 7-band but lacks a visible price that forecloses a future path.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“find stranded luminance before the unknown claims her like it claimed Thorne”—tightens once: the board’s beam forecloses the option to keep studying from safety, forcing descent into cold darkness. Cost is visible: isolation crystallized in the ladder descent, pulsating light replacing engine hum, map ink shimmering with same trapped light she sought. Agency is continuous; each decoding act narrows her next physical move.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single stake—acquire the gears to mend time—remains coherent. Pressure escalates once: mirrors reveal alternate selves, tightening the emotional risk of fragmentation. Yet the stakes never actually test failure or demand a trade-off; the gears are simply handed over and the vortex lets her leave. No visible price is exacted, so the beat feels informational rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—heal the planet via bell—signaled first paragraph. Escalation is linear, not tightening: each ally finds exactly the piece they need (larvae, clapper, song) without trade-off or reversal. Cost is present but collective and diffuse; no single character forfeits a live option. The nebula’s return feels like reward, not irreversible price, keeping pressure below 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the clock strike midnight?”—is abstract but made visceral via the flickering beam and failing hush; one meaningful tightening when her lullaby falters and she bleeds onto the shard, narrowing options. Escalation is textural (glow spreading) rather than causal, fitting the lens. Cost visible but not carried forward as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—keep stranger alive before frost—tightens when map is assembled; failure cost is mechanical-bird mauling. One meaningful turn: she elects to expose herself to birds rather than hide. Price legible: frost bite, heart pound, orchard still cursed—options narrowed, not reset.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signaled paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: foam insight forecloses eternal grief-isolation, enables bridge stance. Cost visible in body—breath, steady climb—under causal lens. Agency internal but decisive; no coin-flip resolution. Persistent grief-tension becomes tactical lens for future bonds.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“find where stories begin”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss (time, bodily risk, social credit) is mounted on its failure. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical: shelves align, whispers coalesce, but Elara’s options never narrow; she merely witnesses the library self-assemble. The one decisive action (incising) is smooth, safe, and consequence-free. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens, satisfying the Accumulative pattern yet staying lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transmute remorse—signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: arrival at central chamber forces either total absorption or retreat; option foreclosed when she touches the shard. Cost visible: tears, physical dissolution of pavilion, “piece of her own sorrow” evacuated. Escalation driven by her serial choices to taste→smooth→absorb; no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—repair fractured community speech—is signaled early. Escalation arrives as the song’s multilingual layering forces first the gears, then the crowd to answer, narrowing Elara’s option to keep singing past exhaustion. Cost is visible (her tears, Kovar’s cracked silence) but the pressure plateaus rather than deepens after the first chime; a second tightening is missing for 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams via memory transfer—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: she risks mind-fracture, but the risk is stated, not tested on-page; no intermediate complication narrows options. The final reconfiguration is earned conceptually, yet the absence of a visible price during the act keeps the escalation just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlock forgotten combinations—tightens once: doodle re-patterning under inversion forecloses mis-reading and makes seed accessible. Cost is visible (year-long wait, gravity fall, seed responsibility). Single meaningful turn suffices for this length; agency is decision-to-enter and alignment act, not violent reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—”give voice to the voiceless”—is declared early but never tested by opposition; no risk of failure or external resistance appears. Pressure escalates only via lyric accumulation of taps; no option is narrowed, no trade-off confronted. The only visible cost is one night’s fatigue, which feels mild against the cosmic ambition. Closure reweights perception, not stakes, so the escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust without restoring oppressive silence—signals early. Escalation is single-track: each chess move tightens the psychic vise until the king-topple forecloses the option to acquiesce. Agency remains internal but causal under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is conceptual rather than material; a moment where the stone’s dent cuts her palm could have made price visceral and pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—recovering silence varieties—are declared early but remain abstract until the diary opens; no concrete price is risked or lost. Escalation is textural: density of silence builds through sensory accretion rather than narrowing options. Protagonist agency is contemplative, not tactical; pressure is situational, low-heat. Cost is retrospective (“honoring silences”) rather than a live forfeiture, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: ambition vs. present-moment serenity. Pressure deepens via accumulating sensory cues; the sprout’s aroma forces the decisive tightening. Cost is legible as she abandons her old striving stance; still, the price could be sharper (no tangible loss shown). Clean escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—planet memory fading—tightens once: echo-dimming ups urgency and forecloses retreat. Elara’s agency steers river, slots arrow, triggers grove revival; luck plays 0% role. Cost is visible—her open-ended guardianship, ship now tethered. Situational lens: pressure mounts environmentally rather than through antagonist, sufficient per short-form guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing future disasters—threads every beat; wind-pattern discovery tightens options, forcing realization that engineering escape was impossible; cost is legible in the crushed plane and Elara’s weighted exit; no second reversal, but single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate wonder—is signaled early and personally. Tightening occurs when the first bell strike spills sunlight, narrowing options: once started, the ritual must complete; reversal is impossible. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—village worldview will shift—but the price is not dramatized on her body/choice in-scene. Pressure stays coherent; one meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieve flute to prevent new rupture—is signaled early and met; pressure tightens once when canyon silence thickens to “tangible” at lift. Agency is passive—music does the weaving—so cost is imagistic, not tactical; no option narrows. Escalation is single crest, sufficient for short form under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves, satisfying Situational guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias survive the fragment’s empathy flood without losing self?—is signaled early and tightened once: retreat/grounding fails, leaving endurance as sole option. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse ups saturation until “tapestry” becomes unbearable. Cost is felt (ragged breath, floor collapse) but remains internal; no external resource is forfeited, so price is legible yet not persistent. Agency stays interior—no outward decision beyond “set fragment down”—which fits lyric mode but caps intensity just under 8-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender the relic that has rooted inside her?—is signaled when the pendant first hums. Pressure tightens once: handing it over severs the new sync, a palpable loss. Agency is again partial (the relic drives the turn), so the cost is felt but not fully self-authored; escalation meets the 600-word threshold yet lacks a second squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb feeling”—is signaled early and tightens when the absorbed grief threatens her composure. One meaningful deepening: blank silence → whispered sorrow → ache in her own heart. Agency remains hers: she could abandon the prism but cradles it instead, accepting the moral cost of knowledge. The price (conceptual heaviness, future burden) is visible in the arbor’s newly weighted air.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“carry a message across impossible distance”—is signaled early and reweighted when silence becomes connective tissue. Single tightening beat: placing the final puzzle piece forecloses retreat and crystallizes the bridge. Cost is felt but not visibly extracted from Elara’s body/tool, keeping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single dominant stake—planet renewal—signals early and tightens once when Eli commits, but the tightening is declarative (“I’ll do it”) rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture. Escalation is linear descent, not reversible pressure; no live option is closed until the off-stage explosion resolves everything. Cost is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover withheld truth—signals early and tightens once when the woman warns “heavier than you imagine,” but no option is foreclosed; Elara passively receives knowledge. No visible price is paid. Escalation is informational, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“protect the light”—is signaled by the etched glass and tightens when the lamp dies. Agency is present: Elias re-orders stones, opens cache, chooses guardianship. Cost is conceptual (lifelong secrecy) rather than tangible; no credible loss (time, tool, social credit) is dramatized. Escalation is singular but coherent under Causal lens; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—seize or reject the unknown dawn—is signaled early and tightens when control of the beam is lost. One meaningful deepening: the Herald pivots from panic to resolve, paying the price of perpetual guardianship; cost is legible in the final bow from the fog-beings.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—learning why stories magnetize—stays theoretical; no on-page test, narrowing, or tangible price. Pressure is situational: the woman’s grief is revealed, but Kael’s goal is neither advanced nor threatened by it; he listens, exits unchanged. Single micro-turn (wing on sill → patrons freeze) is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is therefore decorative; cost absent.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“map sorrow to wholeness”—is clear; pressure escalates as each sextant shard reveals quantified grief, but Elias remains observer/technician rather than agent whose choice narrows; thus the tightening is textural, not consequential, and the price stays diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindle realm—declared early; escalation is lyrical accumulation of song-threads rather than narrowing options. No visible price (fatigue, memory loss, social risk) appears on-page; cost is atmospheric. Agency is receptive—she “finds” and “sings,” not wager. One meaningful cadence shift at lullaby moment, sufficient for 600w Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—embrace paradox vs. stay hidden—signals early; pressure deepens via archive discoveries leading to blank-book moment. No visible price (time, risk, social credit) is dramatized; the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical. Enough for mid-high band, but not the 8+ threshold that requires a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—claiming fragile grace from decay—signals early and tightens as each gardening act uncovers more ruin. Middle beat: plaque discovery reweights the task from random planting to ordained ritual. Cost is visible: tired knees, dirt under nails, the “fragile” peace she dares to feel. No external antagonist, but entropy (ivy, collapse) applies coherent pressure; coincidence (bread arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before oblivion—signaled early; pressure tightens when the anomalous slide forces a choice: preserve protocol or step into the call. The tremor is the one visible escalation; afterward the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, fitting the accumulative lens. No second reversal, but the slide’s rewrite forecloses neutrality—she is now “the one who carries.” Felt price is the open-ended guardianship she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single dominant stake—preserve the truce and her father’s name—signals early and tightens only rhetorically: each encounter restates the risk without narrowing Lila’s options or exacting a visible price. The “until sunrise” clock is named but not tracked; dawn arrives as symbolic curtain, not lived deadline. No credible loss (time, flask, blood, social credit) alters her tactics; the thieves’ retreat feels convenient rather than compelled. Agency stays rhetorical—she rewrites rules by declaration—so escalation misses the felt-cost threshold for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—why some people carry weather—cannot be answered tonight, so tension leaks outward. Pressure plateaus after the ring’s first cue; no further tightening or trade-off occurs. Agency is purely receptive: listen, accept, walk. Cost is deferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—escape mechanical portraiture for authentic self-expression—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hidden self-portrait confronts her, but the pressure is situational/coincidental rather than earned through prior agency; option space narrows symbolically, not tactically. Cost is retrospective (ten lost years) rather than visibly paid within the scene’s present action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost conversations to revive oasis—signals early and tightens when betrayal reveals civic complicity. Escalation driven by her agency: deciphering, descending, choosing to etch truth despite personal wilt. Cost is visible: social safety forfeited, studio isolation sealed, first water drops ambiguously threatening. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—“preserve the color of wonder”—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete resource is risked or lost. Pressure intensifies only via lyric accumulation of light, not through narrowed options or a trade-off that hurts; escalation is aesthetic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the farm and her own coherence”—is signaled early; the meaningful tightening is the box-opening that forecloses avoidance. Cost is visible: nostalgia is drained. Escalation is single-step rather than recursive, so pressure plateaus after the miniaturization beat, keeping it out of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“can listening heal?”—is declared late and never tested under pressure; the letter is already forgiving, so Clara’s reading is witness, not agency. No credible loss or tactical change occurs; tension is atmospheric, not consequential. Escalation is a single soft deepening rather than a narrowing of options, satisfying accumulative but not causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate buried knowledge—tightens once: journal-of-dance demands bodily translation, no alternate route provided. Escalation is Accumulative: density of symbols → body risk → architectural response; cost felt as irreversible guardianship. Calm defiance keeps agency internal; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence absent; all pressure sourced from her choice to dance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are declared early—recover deleted memories—but pressure escalates only texturally (shimmer intensifies, gravity tug) rather than through narrowed options or risk. No meaningful fork or resource lost; the “exhume” action is experiential, not tactical. Accumulative lens accepts this, yet cost remains conceptual, not visceral. Sufficient for mid-high band, but not 8.8+ without a price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—will she risk connection to hear the city’s buried stories?—is declared early. One tightening: Elias reframes the seal as a “key,” forcing her to test the sugar ritual or remain deaf. Cost is conceptual (lost anonymity) rather than tangible; pressure rises but never threatens a concrete loss. Sufficient for this length, yet the absence of a visible price keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“translate isolation into independence”—is stated early but never tested by an on-page trade-off; the shell simply floods her with feelings and the outcome is assured. No option is foreclosed, no price is exacted; pressure stays flat across the single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will she erase the letter and forgive—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the first visible word fade forecloses revenge and commits her to forgiveness. Cost is legible—blank parchment equals lost history—but the tightening is single-gear; no secondary obstacle or resource lost. Coincidence absent; no antagonist. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a second pressure point keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people echo—signaled early and held. Escalation is accumulative: mirrored memories in the pool deepen texture rather than narrow options; no live trade-off or forfeiture appears. Agency is attention-based (gaze into pool) but passive; pressure is observational. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stake: “voice the voiceless” signalled late; no on-page test or price. Escalation is declarative—each dream adds data, not risk. No trade-off; tension is atmospheric. Coincidence drives revelation; agency is contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—“to uncover hidden patterns that wove the world together”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete test or loss is risked. Pressure accumulates imagistically (firefly dance, moon paths) yet never forecloses a live option or demands a trade-off. Agency is limited to looking, listening, and finally a deliberate whistle that ratifies rather than alters her stance. No visible price is paid or resource lost, so escalation stays low-grade lyrical rather than stakes-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs annihilation—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: comfortable lie (“orchard is miracle”) → darker truth (“orchard is prison”) → costly containment. Agency is continuous: each letter fragment she re-glues literally narrows her options until only the seal-chant remains. Price is visible—orchard loses its shield, she loses the diamond’s glow—so cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“shape a new dawn”—is declared early; pressure escalates only once when voice orders “Unfold it.” Prior tension is atmospheric (storm, visions) rather than option-narrowing; protagonist does not sacrifice or forfeit anything on page until final activate-and-smile. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. Lacks a mid-story tightening that forecloses a live path, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias bottle memory without killing it—tightens when the box plays unprompted, forcing renunciation of perfect preservation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from hunter to listener. Cost is legible in the shattered jar and forfeited control. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guardianship of the key—tightens when the vibration forces her to decide: use it or lose it. The mid-story temptation to trust the intruder narrows her moral option to solitary defense, a visible trade-off. Price is paid: the key’s glow scars the intruder but also announces her location to future seekers, a persistent tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—seed patience in self and others—is signaled early and deepens when visitors arrive, escalating the abstract revolution into communal maintenance. The tightening occurs off-stage: we are told “they too began to track moon paths,” so the visible price (time, risk, social capital) is implied rather than dramatized. Protagonist agency stays internal—her final stance is observational—cost is conceptual, legible under Accumulative lens but not viscerally felt. One on-page trade-off (e.g., refusing to leave the sanctuary at thaw, losing outside livelihood) would sharpen escalation to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“break free from mentor control”—is signaled early and tightened when the photograph implicates him. Agency resides in attention and endurance rather than external combat; she keeps descending while knowledge narrows her options. Escalation is knowledge-driven under Causal lens; no redundant reversals, but also no tangible resource lost on-page, so cost is conceptual not visceral. Meets the single meaningful tightening threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: Elias must decide whether Thomas’s claim deserves a second look. Escalation is textural: each silent box Elias touches deepens the metaphorical cost of ignoring Thomas. Single micro-turn—Alistair’s “broken things reveal truth”—tightens stakes without external antagonist. Price legible: chaplain’s calm dissolves into storm imagery, foreshadowing professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Echo-7—signals early and escalates through archive lockout, lie, and personal risk. The meaningful tightening is the system purge that denies access, forcing her to lie and go offline; this narrows options and raises visible cost. Stakes stay coherent; coincidence is absent. The price (job security, possibly career) is legible but could be sharper if we felt one concrete consequence (security badge revoked, supervisor email) before she walks out.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—mend fractured souls—loosed early. Pressure escalates only interpretively: each mirror is a micro-turn, yet no option is foreclosed until the final chime. Cost is conceptual (empathy mapped to light), not tactile; hence mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will she keep spectating or step into the ending’s sound? Tightening occurs when the storm survivor asks what the end sounds like—his vulnerability forecloses her detached observer role. Agency: she decides to “catch the colors,” paying with her armor of distance. Cost is legible: her grip shifts from parasol-as-shield to parasol-as-net, audible in lace flutter.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: can she reframe lost love’s mismatch into peace? Pressure is quiet and accretive—no rising external threat, only contemplative comparison to non-touching vines. The single deepening is the realization that space can be beautiful; it reweights her stance but costs nothing on-page. Tension stays internal and static; no visible price alters later tactics, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echo—signals early and deepens through parapet renewal, but pressure plateaus: no obstacle, resistance, or trade-off surfaces; success is unopposed. The prophet’s imminence acts as clock yet arrives post-resolution, so time does not force tactical change. Consecration is agency-driven, cost is conceptual (future responsibility), meeting minimal 8-band bar, but without visible loss the escalation feels decorative rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transmute pain into collective memory—is declared early but never materially tested; no obstacle, shortage, or competing desire complicates the photo-arranging. Pressure is ambient, not tactical; the only “tightening” is the sun setting, which cues closure rather than foreclosing an option. Visible cost is absent—she packs up unimpeded—so escalation remains atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost language—is declared early and tightened once: the crystal’s fading echo forces completion now or never. Agency is interior and accumulative rather than a sharp reversal; the “cost” (crystal will die) is known before the final beat, so escalation is steady, not spiky. Under Accumulative lens this suffices, yet the absence of a second live option keeps tension cerebral, not visceral. No price is paid on-page beyond the abstract foreknowledge, capping entry to upper-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are singular: capture the unnamed sound or keep drowning in echoes. Pressure escalates by density, not causality—each new marker adds weight to the possibility that the map itself is the trap. The circle’s completion is the tightening: no further direction possible, only listening. Cost is conceptual but felt: he forfeits the chalk, the very tool of orientation. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is attention versus forgetting, and attention wins by renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freeze the ephemeral without freezing life—lands early and tightens through the hand’s acceleration; each paragraph adds density rather than new plot forks. The meaningful deepening is the leaf-sound realization: it re-structures time from linear to layered, foreclosing the option of mere repair. Cost is conceptual but legible: the observatory forfeits eternal silence for a living pulse. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and achieved without friction; escalation is therefore static. Claire’s arrival tightens the room emotionally but does not test Elara’s agency or force a trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Protagonist faces zero adaptation; the plan works on first try, so pressure plateaus rather than rises. Cost is off-loaded onto the dying woman and estranged daughter; Elara’s own stakes remain risk-free.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“mend truths”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the fountain demands a piece of certainty, foreclosing her control. Cost is visible (stone sinking, warmth), but escalation is single-step rather than deepening; coincidence plays no role. Agency is renunciation, not tactic-altering struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver starlight without fire—tightens once: the glass must achieve mirror-brightness or her vow collapses. Pressure is textural rather than causal (density of polish, color intensifying), but the final beam forecloses the option to retreat back to fire, and the price (years of scarred trial) is recalled on-page, satisfying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can protected vulnerability survive exposure to a second pair of eyes? Pressure tightens once—Kai’s arrival—forcing a binary: retreat or share the garden. Escalation is situational: no external antagonist, but the stakes feel credible because viral shame lingers as ambient threat. Renunciation of total privacy is visible cost; the garden’s meaning is repriced from solitary sanctuary to shared language.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“collect the shapes of different hopes”—is declared early; pressure thickens via accumulating cameos, each adding emotional density. No narrowing of options or visible price is dramatized for Elara; the risk is purely empathetic overload, not a foreclosed path. Escalation is textural, not causal; sufficient for length but stays below 8-band cost threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—restore forgotten remedies—signals early; escalation occurs via intensifying light pattern rather than protagonist trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; failure never threatens on-page. Cost is conceptual (future burden to teach) but not felt inside the scene. Alignment mechanic externalizes pressure, reducing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve starlight to make heartbeat-maps—is declared early but never sharpened by an opposing force or ticking clock; pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is textural: each added discard thickens the pattern, culminating in the tremor/glow, yet no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Elara. The “world exhales” but does not demand a response, so tension plateaus at wonder rather than risk. Without a visible loss or irreversible narrowing, the conflict stays lyrical, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“capture ephemeral wonder before the world dulls”—is anchored early. One meaningful tightening: only at dusk-angle do gears sync, narrowing the option window. The price (days without sleep, bodily wear) is gestured but not specified enough to hit 8.8+. Escalation is steady under causal lens; no false reversals, but the harvest itself feels more wondrous than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collect vs. release burdens—tightens once when the figure offers the hand-off; Elara’s refusal crystallizes stance and forecloses external rescue. Cost is legible: internal crack widens, lamp flame steadies to mark new solitary path. A second tightening would have secured 9+ territory, but single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—convert grief into artifact—tightens once: the lion’s mane complexity forces a tactile trade-off between perfect recall and accepting imperfection. The cost is legible in her bleeding fingertips and the kettle’s waning whistle, but escalation is single-tier; no secondary pressure tests her resolve. Sufficient for this compressed frame, but a second constraint would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can she reassemble a self worth inhabiting?”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each fragment collected adds density until the wheel-voice tightens the cord. The cost is felt when she realizes the ghost is “guide” not enemy; option space narrows to forward motion. No causal reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake = resurrect the terminal to prove hope’s equation. Pressure escalates only once: when he rigs airflow/light to create “illusion of movement.” No credible loss (time, tools, social credit) is risked; success is frictionless. The tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, so cost stays conceptual. Meets default for one meaningful deepening but not the 8.8+ visible-price gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single dominant stake—stay vs. leave—is signaled early; the meaningful tightening occurs when the crystals whisper “bear,” forcing Elara to confront the blank clock as synecdoche for her abandoned path. Agency is present—she picks up tools and inscribes—but the external pressure remains ambient rather than adversarial; escalation is a density build, not a narrowing of options. Cost is legible in the sanctuary’s “lighter” air and her trembling hands, yet the stakes never sharpen into a tangible forfeit (time, tool, social credit), keeping pressure just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing hidden truth—signals early and tightens once: chest opening forces a go-forward with the journal. Agency is present; Elara’s salvaging decision drives the reversal. Cost is conceptual (burden of captain’s guilt and wider deceit) but not viscerally felt—no tool breakage, social risk, or time loss on page. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; canal decay and radio silence heighten ambient tension. Sufficient for this length, yet the absence of a palpable price keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve weaver knowledge—signaled early and escalates via knot density. One meaningful tightening: spiral-within-spiral demands new cognitive leap. Agency is attention-based; path foreclosed when final knot “yielded its meaning,” cultural loss averted. Cost is collective-cultural, not personal; lack of visible personal price keeps score from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can the widow relinquish the identity of waiting? Pressure escalates through accumulative repetition of ship-afterglow and garden quiet until the obituary reading forces a public re-labeling. The traveler's agency is minimal but sufficient—her steady presence is the lever; the widow's tear is the visible cost that forecloses further nightly vigils. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is tested and paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore natural beauty—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the machine voice demands understanding “cost.” Yet Kael’s agency is limited to listening and cradling; no tactic is abandoned or resource lost, so the tightening is intellectual, not visceral. The final cost is announced in reflection rather than dramatized through forfeiture, keeping escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: prove scars (personal, village, land) can bloom. Pressure grows texturally—each reference to infertile sand tightens the likelihood of failure—culminating in the one decisive act of graft; cost is the gamble of public shame if the patch dies. No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens once, at the mirror-shard beat where she confronts her younger self. The deepening is accretive rather than causal, but under the Accumulative lens the pattern break (mirror = memory) reweights cost legibly. No off-stage resolution; her agency drives the final insertion. Price is conceptual rather than visceral—no blood, no forfeited tool—so the escalation stop just below the 8.5 band that demands a sharper tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightens once when the gear begins to pulse, but the escalation is atmospheric density rather than a narrowing fork. No visible price or lost option is dramatized; the garden simply brightens. Coincidence is avoided, yet agency feels observational rather than decisive, keeping pressure just under the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—how to give grief a shape—signaled in paragraph two and reweighted from “impossible” to “migration.” One meaningful deepening: ribbon pattern = butterfly flight = carved channel in stone; this conceptual pivot narrows her options to etching motion, not stasis. Cost is conceptual (grief as endless passage) rather than tangible loss of tool, time, or relationships, so legible but not visceral. No external antagonist or reversal, fitting accumulative design; pressure coheres through imagery density, not plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—is signaled early; pressure escalates via accretion of townspeople healed rather than by external antagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the tower’s stillness must map onto human stillness; this reweights his duty but does not narrow tactical options. Cost is conceptual (perpetual quiet service) rather than tangible loss, visible in closure image. Agency is present yet low-temperature; tension is lyric, not causal, satisfying the accumulative lens but limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes—“to give voice to the voiceless”—stay abstract; the only tightening is Elias finishing the untangling, which neither narrows options nor extracts a price. Pressure is aesthetic, not operative under the Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as texture without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint”—is signaled early and re-energized when the quill takes over, tightening options: surrender to magic or risk blank failure. The decisive intensification is the moment the written future audibly alters the landscape (laughter, rustling leaves); cost is legible as irreversible public exposure of his vision. Pressure plateaus rather than escalates twice, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—recover lost stories—is declared early but never tested on-page; no tangible resource is risked. Pressure is atmospheric (glow spreads, song fades) rather than tactical; the song slows as courtesy, not cost. No reversal narrows options; escalation is a mood gradient. Closure reconfigures stance, yet the absence of felt price keeps tension conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve cognitive order versus face future adaptation. Pressure tightens once: collapse threat forces choice between hoard and mobility. Cost is visible—he loses the sewer’s insulated time-capsule certainty—but the price is more conceptual than tangible. Agency stays causal; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rescuing vanishing arts—signaled early; pressure tightens when audience silence becomes the test. Escalation is ritual, not obstacle: each rehearsal deepens pattern; final performance is first public exposure. Cost is communal (library reborn), not personal; Elara’s own options don’t narrow, keeping it from 8.8+. Agency resides in her decision to “subtract,” but no tangible loss (students quit? job cut?) is risked or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—wake the world to nurturing—signals early and tightens once: the sprout races skyward, forcing her to decide whether to trust the fruit or destroy it. Escalation is driven by her agency (pruning debris, staying awake) under Causal lens; celestial coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible: dirt-under-nails fatigue, fear of silence. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—arrives late (riddle line 6) but sticks. One meaningful tightening: touching the orb forces irreversible knowledge, foreclosing ignorance. Cost is conceptual (lifelong burden of truth) rather than visceral; no concrete loss (friendship, job, blood) is shown on-page. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal, so escalation plateau hovers at “strong” rather than “exceptional.”</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
    <comment>Theme—wonder preserved through painful truth—emerges via orb vision rather than sermon. The drones’ sacrificial logic complicates a simple “truth is good” moral, offering plausible counter-reading: maybe ignorance was bliss. Final whisper avoids explicit thesis; image of tower re-humming under amber dawn lets reader feel reprice. One dab of thematic echo: “wonder in routine” is repeated phrasing near start and end, but it’s brief enough to escape penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake—uncovering why houses feel alive—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external or internal force blocks Elias, so pressure is ambient, not tactical. The only escalation is a cadence shift: objects glow after sanctification, reweighting perception. Without a narrowing choice or forfeiture, the tightening is lyrical, not consequential, keeping tension at moderate simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—village survival—signaled early. Pressure tightens when Liora’s warning fractures Elara’s certainty; the meaningful turn is her choice to retest, foreclosing immediate rescue. Cost is conceptual (delayed cure, risk of loss) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it below 8.8. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens: because Liora speaks, Elara hesitates; therefore lives are saved via adjusted dose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of a missed opportunity—tightens when the die-loss forces Elara to convert that desire into letting-go; perpetual motion ideal survives only by embracing impermanence. Escalation is accumulative: each roll thickens the chalk-dust pattern until the seven, then the three, reweight options. Visible price: mentor relic lost, path foreclosed. No external antagonist needed; staircase pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: rouse lost language; signaled early via brush hum. Tightening occurs when vision hijacks her hand—options narrow from self-expression to transcription. Cost is emotional breathlessness and irrevocable dawn exhaustion; visible but not resource-loss. Agency is partial—brush as co-actor—keeping escalation one notch below high band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—will communal memory survive?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elara fears “it would soon be lost to time.” The single meaningful escalation comes as the lens chimes and the square fills with song; this deepens the stakes from private anxiety to public revival. Cost is present (she relinquishes sole custody of the lens and its mystery), but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Agency is adequate for this length; coincidence is avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bend personal fate—is signaled early and tightens once: the island’s resistance raises the cost. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: because Elias decodes the yoyo, the stone awakens; therefore the lighthouse reverses. The visible price is the reversed world he must now inhabit, but the beat is compressed into a single eruptive moment rather than a sequence of narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is clear from advisor’s mandate and narrows to Clara’s personal fear of being forgotten. Escalation is accumulative: mirror reflections and ticking clocks intensify texture rather than options; one meaningful tightening occurs when she confronts the cursed clasp vision and chooses to speak her fear aloud, collapsing funhouse illusion. Agency is interior (naming) with visible cost: mirrors shatter, light dies, advisor solidifies—external signs that the pressure has landed. No reversals, but one credible renunciation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are abstract—restore cosmic dissonance—so pressure feels aesthetic rather than tactical. Escalation is accumulative: successive notes thicken cloud fractals, but the protagonist is never cornered or forced to trade one thing away. Cost is present only as atmospheric sublimity, not as forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decipher the watchers and save Valtara—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is causal: each whistle note tightens risk until the turtle shell cracks open, narrowing her option to descend. Cost is visible: the crack is irreversible, the chamber exposes her to obsidian gaze, and the voice warns “time is running out.” No coincidence rescues; the final obligation is driven by her own pattern-reading success.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    A single dominant stake—“rescue truth from lies”—is declared early. Pressure never tightens; the archive reveals rather than tests. No option is foreclosed, no visible price paid on-page; the protagonist’s stance does not crystallize. Escalation is informational, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover drowned dreams—tightens when the journal reframes absence as communal rather than architectural, forcing Elias to shift from mapping to burial/raising ritual. Escalation is textural: each recovered object (journal, note-sealed crack, mosaic) deepens the same absence rather than narrows external options, satisfying the Accumulative lens. A visible price is paid—raw hands, soaked clothes, the inkwell’s new moral weight—yet the pavilion never threatens him physically or socially, keeping the cost interior and capping intensity just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover untainted origins—tightens when the map threatens to expose complicity. Agency is present: she chooses to stamp, knowing the library will reconfigure. Cost is conceptual (heritage rewritten), not personal; stakes never risk her safety or identity. Escalation is linear, single-turn; no secondary pressure complicates the path, so the tightening is meaningful but not layered.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Kael stay trapped in crafted grief or risk feeling it?—is signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when Lira tells him “grief is meant to be felt,” stripping his crafting defense; this narrows options and forces the basilica choice. Cost is felt (knees sink, light softens), although the external price is more imagistic than material. Sufficient escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—hunt for latent potential—signals early and recurs, but pressure plateaus; no second tightening or trade-off complicates the search. Escalation is poetic (crystal glow moment) rather than causal; cost is implied, not dramatized. Protagonist agency remains observational; no resource or option is visibly foreclosed. Meets short-form minimum but lacks visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep burying truth—tightens once when the watch hand is reclaimed by the sand; pressure is textural, not causal, so the escalation reads as accumulating symbolic weight rather than narrowing options, satisfying the lens but leaving the cost more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the apology-forgiveness currency—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s refusal forecloses easy absolution. Escalation is situational: storm and pride apply coherent pressure; Elara’s rhetoric is the single agency that reweights options. Cost is legible in Kael’s grudging nod and Elara’s smile that knows the path is fragile. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through navigation—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: compass failure forces adaptation to poles; this narrowing is causal and visible. No secondary reversal or tangible price (time, injury, social loss) is dramatized; the cost is emotional only and stated, not shown through forfeiture. Sufficient for the length, but the absence of a concrete loss keeps it sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can he buy innocence by forgetting? Pressure tightens once: ball drops → must follow → must surface changed. Escalation is situational but coherent; no external antagonist needed; the lake’s lure is the pressure. Cost is visible—loss of talisman, lung burn, commitment to carry empathy—yet beat is singular; no second reversal. Sufficient for length, but not spine-tingling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—self-reconciliation—is declared early yet remains abstract; no concrete forfeiture (tool, time, bodily risk) is risked on-page. Pressure escalates atmospherically—fragrance thickens, orchard parts—but these are passive environmental cues, not because/therefore obstacles that foreclose options. Guardian issues advice instead of demand; Elara’s conjuring succeeds without visible price or adaptation. Accumulative pattern deepens mood, but agency is contemplative rather than tactical; cost is conceptual not visceral, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled early and personal. Pressure tightens once: the glowing crack reveals missed moments, narrowing her option set from search to acceptance. No visible external price is paid (no injury, no exile); cost is purely internal, so escalation feels moderate, not acute. Under Accumulative lens, the single cadence shift suffices, but it peaks at emotional recognition rather than irreversible loss, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—unlock the dimension or humanity ends—is signaled early. Escalation is one-phase: stitching severs the seal, narrowing option from “locked” to “open.” The price is conceptual—she accepts custodianship of a ruined paradise—but no tangible resource (fuel, time, bodily safety) is lost on-page, so cost is legible but not visceral. Agency is hers; coincidence absent; sufficient for 7.5, not the 8.8 tier that demands a felt toll.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender her guiding symbol?—is signaled once the bottle brightens under the arch. Escalation is textural: light pulses sync with stars, tightening the moment until release becomes inevitable. Cost is conceptual rather than tactile—she trades private relic for cosmic participation—but is rendered on-page ("their light merged with the stars"). Agency is present but gentle; the hush, not opposition, drives the turn, keeping the score in low-7 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“awaken the oppressed without bloodshed”—is clear early. One meaningful tightening: Thorne’s appearance compresses options from puzzle-solving to stand-off. Elara’s agency triggers the cradle, but the price is off-loaded onto the sleeping populace rather than her own flesh, blunting visceral cost. Escalation is coherent under causal lens yet stays intellectual; no live resource is forfeited on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are abstract—cosmic pattern vs. personal sanity—but the text makes them visceral by tying each auroral intensification to Kael’s rising heart rate and trembling hands. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last rock locks the sequence, eliminating the option to retreat; escalation is thus knowledge-density rather than external peril. Cost is visible: frictionless world re-orients his gait and future choices. The threat remains intellectual, so the visceral ceiling is mid-8s, cleanly hit.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—will Elara break lifelong self-censorship?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulative storm and ticking timer; map arrival tightens by forcing confrontation with literal skin-level memories. Agency resides in internal stance shift rather than external obstacle; cost is present but conceptual (loss of protective silence) rather than visceral. Escalation is single-beat yet coherent under lyric lens; would benefit from one intermediate complication testing refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (possess the overture) but never tested by a concrete risk or forfeiture; the debate remains academic. No meaningful narrowing of options—both characters simply philosophize toward mutual awe. Cost is verbal, not felt: no time, tool, or social price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—beauty-from-anarchy—signals early and tightens through each poem-painted beat; the library’s growing glow literalizes the abstraction. Escalation is textural: density of verses on walls replaces rising causal threat. A visible price (Elias abandons perpetual reinvention) appears only in the final paragraph; earlier stakes feel conceptual rather than visceral. Sufficient for 8-band but lacks a mid-scene foreclosure that would punch higher.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara can renegotiate fate—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only narratively: “air carried a weight” rather than through tangible obstacles or forfeits. The reel journey risks nothing tangible; no option is foreclosed, no price paid until the symbolic clock restart. Sufficient for short-form, but scarcity of on-page cost caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (cultural memory loss) are declared early and repeated, yet no on-page symptom of that loss—mis-sung lyric, erased carving, forgotten name—materializes to make the threat visceral. Pressure escalates only by calendar (“monsoon coming”) rather than by mounting obstacles or harder choices; Elara meets no setback, alternate path, or resource limit. Agency is limited to answering a single riddle; the rest is walking, planting, and narrating success. The cost is conceptual, not dramatized, so the tightening feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation through decay—is signaled early and deepens as dust patterns evolve from passive observation to responsive architecture. Pressure tightens when the dust begins “decoding her intentions,” raising the conceptual stakes. Agency is present in Elara’s deliberate patterning, though the escalation leans heavily on wonder rather than tangible trade-offs. Cost is felt thematically (abandoning drama for humility) but lacks a concrete forfeiture that alters her scientific path or personal life beyond the greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth to rescue apprentice—is signaled early and deepens via ledger discoveries. Pressure escalates through environmental clues rather than opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs at the grotto: knowledge gained forecloses ignorance, forcing action. Cost is felt (lost workshop, missing apprentice), but no tangible loss alters tactics mid-journey, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens through failed attempts and Kael’s arrival. Pressure escalates via accumulated emotional data and shared discovery, not coincidence. The meaningful tightening occurs when they amplify the pulse into melody, narrowing Elara’s path from desperate recreation to receptive listening. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of sound as the sole medium of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes the lens as a soul-conduit. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to search, dive, and reassemble despite daunting odds. The cost is conceptual (bearing the city’s collective memory) and felt in his lifted weariness. However, the escalation lacks a concrete trade-off or loss (e.g., damaged lantern, failing air); stakes remain emotionally resonant but not viscerally constrained by resource depletion or physical peril.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational survival under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mara chooses visibility over anonymity, catalyzing collective action. This deepening shifts tactics from solitary aid to communal building, with visible cost in continued resource scarcity. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation relies more on emotional resonance than tangible opposition. No false resolutions; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering unexpressed love—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant triggers memory. Pressure escalates texturally: breath slows, spark pulses, alcove appears. The protagonist’s agency drives each turn (kneeling, walking, placing pendant), and the cost—carrying healed grief into the world—is felt in her lighter steps. Coincidence is avoided; the viaduct responds to her purity of intent, consistent with legend.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memory through temporal texture—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment warms and the maze shifts. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, navigate, and place the fragment, each act narrowing options. The cost is conceptual (the fragment’s destruction) and emotional (confronting ancestral loss), legible in the restored photographs. Yet the maze’s cooperation feels too aligned with her desire; opposition is atmospheric rather than resistant, softening pressure just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the seeds before the wall collapses—is signaled early and tightens once: the liberator must decode the arrow using the piano before time runs out. Pressure escalates coherently under the Causal lens, with enemies arriving as a complication (not resolution). However, the final escape relies on convenient spatial knowledge rather than a meaningful trade-off; no credible loss (e.g., dropping jars, injury from chains) alters tactics. The wall’s collapse is declared but not dramatized as an active narrowing of options during the chase.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s methodical collection of absences. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, but the tightening is meaningful: each absence gathered sharpens emotional resonance until the forge scene crystallizes the cost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—she chooses to seek, collect, and imprint—and the price is felt in her chest, not explained. Coincidence plays no role; resolution arises from sustained effort under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing “illuminated moments” to confront destiny—is signaled early and deepens when the jar’s true nature (a captured soul) reframes the quest from acquisition to stewardship. Lira’s agency drives escalation: reading then rewriting the floral code forces the confrontation. Cost is legible in her hesitation and the emotional burden accepted. Coincidence is avoided; pressure remains coherent under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—creating judgment-free spaces for inquiry—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s confrontation with her own fear of vulnerability. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons control, accepting the unknown. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing predictability) but legible in her final gesture. Escalation is driven by internal agency under an Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains minimal; the melting ice complicates but doesn’t concretely raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming identity) is clear early, and the tightening occurs when the seashell leads to the key—a narrowing of possibility. But escalation relies on discovery, not agency: Elara deciphers notes passively; the “outwitting” lacks tactical friction. Cost is felt emotionally but not viscerally—no tangible loss alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping endless night—is signaled early and deepens through each retelling, narrowing options until dawn is conceptually foreclosed. Protagonist agency drives escalation: their method sculpts silence into terrain, with cost felt in trembling hands and vanished stars. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the origin of thought—is signaled early and deepens when the violin activates looped timelines. Unit-7’s agency drives escalation: it chooses to play, triggering the vision. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from janitor to “seeker,” crystallized in its departure. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure tightens via protagonist action under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through transparency—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s decision to sketch honesty into doodles. The tightening occurs when she places her drawing beside the lens, risking rejection. Cost is felt (“words were unnecessary”) but not visibly paid; no path is truly foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from solitude to shared silence suffices, though a sharper trade-off (e.g., professional vulnerability) would have strengthened escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating his bond with the garden—is signaled early and deepens through the marble ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias shifts from commemorating victories to confronting self-deception, narrowing his emotional options. Cost is felt: he relinquishes the need for external proof, accepting mutual knowing as enough. Luck’s measurability adds texture but doesn’t drive pressure; still, protagonist agency shapes every escalation, satisfying lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and intensifies credibly through Elara’s defiance of peer ridicule. Pressure escalates causally: calibration → activation → destabilization → manual override → stabilization. The cost is felt: system failures, near-catastrophe, and the burden of a world-altering secret. However, the stakes remain largely internal and intellectual; the external peril (station collapse) resolves too cleanly, muting the long-term consequence needed to fully weight the climax under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s code to disrupt silence—is signaled early and deepens when the program reveals musical notes. Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency: she hums, triggering environmental response and ghostly manifestation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to vocalize, risking exposure or failure, though the cost remains abstract (no physical, social, or temporal price beyond emotional longing). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure grows via sensory density rather than narrowed options, satisfying requirements for this length, but lacks a concrete forfeiture that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens when the smudge forces confrontation with imperfection. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara chooses to augment rather than erase the flaw, narrowing her path from seeker to shaper. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of pristine certainty, now replaced by “shadow and light.” Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the wanderer’s arrival edges toward convenient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting her father’s swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens when whispers echo his radio calls. Pressure escalates via sound (clanking → whispers → screams) and temperature (air grows colder), forcing Mara forward. Yet escalation relies on external phenomena rather than protagonist-driven agency; she reacts, not acts, until the final turn. The cost is purely emotional (“weight lift”), which under a Causal lens feels insufficient for high-band closure without visible forfeiture or altered future path.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile balance—is signaled early and deepens when the swan reveals “Burrow,” forcing Lira to choose between passive witnessing and active seeking. The tightening occurs via her decision to enter the refuge, which narrows her path to acceptance. Cost is clear: the library’s peace is irrevocably altered, and her solitude is transformed. Agency drives escalation, though the refuge’s mechanics lean slightly mystical without full causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—nurturing dormant wonder—is signaled early and deepens during the eclipse climax. Elara’s agency drives the turning point: she initiates humming, shares the curl, and guides Finn’s attention. The tightening occurs when the ordinary (hair curl) becomes extraordinary through shared perception, foreclosing Finn’s fear-based interpretation. Yet the cost remains conceptual (abandoned telescope) rather than viscerally felt; no tangible sacrifice or irreversible loss anchors the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring humanity’s capacity to dream—is signaled early and deepens through discovery of the diaries and scrolls. Pressure escalates via knowledge gains, not external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet the escalation lacks tangible cost: Elara faces no real obstacle, risk, or trade-off. The ritual succeeds cleanly, with no failure, doubt, or consequence that alters her tactics. Stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally urgent, weakening the emotional pressure despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (“unravel mysteries”) is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or narrowing options. The “tightening” is internal epiphany, not external pressure; coincidence (accidental brush with specs) resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid—agency is passive reception of “clarity,” not active choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—exposing hidden assumptions before possession completes—is signaled early and tightens through rhetorical escalation. The priest’s agency drives deepening: each question peels back layers, forcing the anchor to confront its foundations. Cost is felt in the growing hunger of the possession and the weight of silence, though no concrete forfeiture (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but pressure peaks in abstraction rather than embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—completing the symphony before exhaustion—is signaled early and tightens as dawn approaches. The meaningful deepening occurs when the writer shifts from inscription to vocalization, escalating from passive mapping to active invocation. Agency is clear: the whisper is a decisive act under pressure. Cost is felt (physical collapse) and conceptual (surrender of authorial control to the harp). Yet the escalation leans heavily on atmosphere over tangible consequence; the “unheard symphonies” remain abstract, limiting the visceral weight of the stakes despite elegant execution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and deepens as Elara confronts darker versions of herself, narrowing her options from defiance to acceptance. The meaningful tightening occurs when the tablet dims, raising urgency, and culminates in her renunciation of control. However, the cost remains largely conceptual; no tangible forfeiture (time, tool, relationship) alters her tactics mid-journey. The “darkening brightness” tone modulates stakes effectively, but the absence of external pressure limits the felt weight of her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens via backward-song experiment. Agency drives escalation: Elara chooses risk over stasis, investing days in fragile hope. Cost is visible: exhaustion, vulnerability, the shattered needle as symbol of broken past. However, the method’s success feels slightly unearned—no failure or setback tempers her breakthrough, softening pressure just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting truth through integrity—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to enter the compound, risking his solitude. Pressure escalates coherently under the Causal lens, and the cost (abandoning sanctuary) is legible at closure. However, the “follower” introduces tension that evaporates without payoff, diluting escalation. The rogue zone’s threat remains abstract; stakes hinge more on idea than visceral danger.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—confronting grief through scent—is signaled early and tightens when Elias touches the vial, triggering irreversible visions. His agency drives escalation: choosing to uncork it after passive avoidance. Cost is felt (years of suppressed mourning), though the vial’s mechanics border on coincidental resolution; it complicates but also solves too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“uncover time’s texture”) tightens meaningfully when the mirror forces an impossible trilemma—bound, drift, or uncover—each path carrying visible cost (lost self, purposelessness, burden of knowledge). Elias’s agency drives escalation: his poem triggers the map; his touch activates the mirror. The energy beings’ presence raises stakes by making time feel “infinite and fleeting,” but their role borders on coincidental complication rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—filling the chronic hush with meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the bowl reframes silence as canvas. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her decision to play transforms passive mourning into active creation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning fear of the void) and visible in her renewed purpose. However, pressure remains largely internal; external stakes lack tangible consequence beyond mood shift, slightly limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (crafting joy without attachment) tightens when Elara discovers Kael’s buried memory, forcing her to weave transience into the emotion—a trade-off that narrows her options. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her static-sensing detects the transformation, compelling the subsumption act. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts that her “half truth” will leave Kael with bittersweet clarity, not pure joy. Minor deduction: the “metallic” scent’s pressure feels atmospheric rather than tactical, slightly softening the deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—initiating unseen kindness—is signaled early and deepens through letter-writing, culminating in a face-to-face meeting. The cost is subtle: emotional vulnerability after years of guarded solitude, implied by “cautious exuberance.” But escalation leans on coincidence (wrong envelope), and agency is passive until the final invitation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, yet the tightening lacks a decisive trade-off—no path is truly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Lira discovers Echo’s tag, transforming passive longing into active search. This tightening forecloses isolation as an option: she must engage or remain adrift. The cost is felt (months of effort, emotional exposure) and shapes tactics (weaving others’ stories into her art). However, escalation relies slightly on coincidence (Echo appearing precisely when sought), though it complicates rather than resolves—Echo’s message redirects Lira inward, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring creative rhythm through temporal access—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant reveals its function. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she steps onto the ledge, navigates the shifting canal, unlocks the gate. The cost is conceptual but legible: she must accept impermanence rather than seize time. The “giant’s nap” clock tightens options, though its mechanics remain poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the journal warns of danger, raising the cost of continued research. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to proceed despite risk, using the glass eyes as lens. The deepening (mentor’s failed attempt) narrows options—she must either abandon or refine his method. Cost is felt: inheriting his peril while risking emotional unraveling. Coincidence (finding eyes) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible to those who need them—is signaled early and deepens through interaction with the cache. The meaningful tightening occurs when the dweller chooses to pursue the fragments despite sanctuary risk, narrowing options. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though cost remains largely emotional/conceptual. Coincidence (lights flickering) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) is signaled early and tightens when the leaf “thrives in spite of her efforts,” forcing a deepening that narrows her options. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency—she chooses to press the leaf to her chest, rearrange pots—and the storm intensifies pressure coherently. Cost is visible: her sanctuary becomes unfamiliar, her old self “dissolved.” Yet the tightening lacks a concrete forfeiture beyond emotional release, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the map reveals “Exchange,” forcing Elara to trade personal artistry for communal memory. The escalation is driven by her agency: following rain, deciphering symbols, choosing to accept the book. Cost is felt in the quiet forfeiture of her old creative identity, crystallized in the final act of painting not for herself but as conduit. Coincidence (storm guiding her) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the exchange hinges on her willingness to receive.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling clairvoyance with unpredictability—is signaled early and deepens when the cave reveals her true role. The tightening occurs at the pearl-touch: her passive arrival becomes active guardianship, foreclosing her old identity. Cost is conceptual (abandoning predictive certainty) but not viscerally felt; the “unseen forces” guide her conveniently, reducing pressure. Escalation relies more on environmental shift than protagonist-driven choice, softening agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the valve hums, forcing Elara to sound it despite risk. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her deciphering of tidal patterns leads to the carved wood, which triggers the valve’s response. Cost is legible in her solitude and the burden of succession (“my time is done”). Coincidence (the woman’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s final act is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the unknown versus clinging to control—is signaled early and deepens when the fortress demands confrontation with buried truths. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow arrows, enter the fortress, and punch the ticket. The cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) and felt (“trembling certainty”), though the external world offers no resistance, making pressure purely internal. Coincidence (midnight timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the punch’s power is earned by her willingness to use it.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—longing for connection—is signaled early and deepens via the tile’s revelations. The meaningful tightening occurs at the tower: Elara chooses belief over doubt, foreclosing her old solitude. Cost is emotional (loss of skepticism) but not viscerally dramatized—no tradeoff of time, safety, or relationship. Escalation is driven by external magic more than protagonist agency, weakening pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escaping existential void through discovery—is signaled early and intensifies coherently. Elyr’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to pick up the fragment, manipulate magnetic fields, and channel the storm, each act narrowing options and raising stakes. The spatial mutiny represents a meaningful tightening: reality itself rebels, raising the cost of his curiosity. Though the storm complicates, resolution stems from Elyr’s decisions, not luck. Cost is legible in the chaotic symphony of colliding dimensions and his transformed inner void—felt, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escaping via political asylum versus staying honestly—is signaled early and tightens when Clara names the absurdity: “None of this does.” Her active waiting crystallizes into confrontation, narrowing options. The cost is felt: relinquishing the con life means facing uncertainty without deception. Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency, not coincidence, though the ink pot’s supernatural ripple slightly risks externalizing internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—collecting textures of time—is signaled early and deepens when the hum delivers a “memory” rather than an “invented history,” raising emotional and conceptual stakes. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her listening, charting), and the cost (trembling hands, charged restraint) is legible. Yet the tightening doesn’t foreclose a path; she simply gains more purpose, missing a sharper tradeoff required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased humanity—is signaled early and deepens upon finding Elara’s letter. The meaningful intensification occurs in the archive, where abstract quest becomes personal. However, escalation is discovery-driven (coincidental finding of symbol-marked container) rather than protagonist-agency-driven; the wanderer reacts, not acts. Cost is conceptual (awareness of systemic erasure) but not viscerally felt in tactics or forfeiture, limiting pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the grandfather’s riddle—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the compass is a state of being, not a tool. Escalation occurs through her playing, which intensifies pressure until the shell glows and time tilts. The cost is conceptual (abandoning her myth-buster identity) and legible in the ending, though no tangible forfeiture (e.g., leaving the cello behind) grounds it more viscerally. Agency drives the turn, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal identity against gentrification—is signaled early and deepens at the Festival. Lira’s agency drives escalation (decoding graffiti, organizing display), but opposition (Vorin) lacks adaptive pressure. Cost is conceptual (threat of erasure) but not viscerally felt through concrete loss (e.g., displacement, violence). The tightening occurs, yet stakes remain abstract rather than embodied in irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving history against progress—is signaled early and tightens when the mentor’s message appears, forcing Elara to choose between obedience and legacy. The escalation is driven by her agency: scanning the message, documenting obsessively, defying recall. Cost is felt in the “heavy heart” and temporal pressure of dawn. Yet the terraforming threat remains abstract; no tangible consequence manifests if she fails, softening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring broken trust between humanity and technology—is signaled early and deepens as the drone revives in sync with the ship’s departure. Pressure escalates texturally: the groaning anchor, crowd cheers, and thickening mist heighten urgency without disrupting Elara’s focus. Agency lies in attention and endurance; her calm is the resistance. Cost is felt implicitly—the traveler’s palpable relief—but never concretized as personal sacrifice, slightly muting the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is signaled early and deepens when the ice reveals hidden flow. Agency is subtle but present: Elara chooses to follow the mist, kneel, dip her hand. The tightening occurs when vibration under ice confirms subterranean water, narrowing options from speculation to witness. Cost is felt: her atlas-editing life is left behind (“the world she was leaving”), though the price could be more concretely dramatized than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring shared balance through rhythm—is signaled early and deepens texturally as the town responds. Pressure accumulates via sensory shifts (whispers, clearer echoes), but agency remains passive; Elias walks, listens, waits—no meaningful tightening forces a difficult choice. The bell’s chime resolves the arc through pattern payoff, not protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is conceptual (time, solitude) but never viscerally felt or dramatized as a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. discovery—is signaled early, and the oxygen countdown creates nominal urgency. Yet pressure dissipates when the vial magically transforms the temple, removing tangible consequences. The “tightening” is conceptual (time runs short) but never forces a concrete trade-off; Maya’s shift feels consequence-free. Coincidence resolves the cave-in via mystical architecture, undermining agency. No visible price alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming his name through truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias learns the hush demands human sacrifice. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, reads the journal, and renounces his father’s path. The cost—three vanished guards as “offerings”—is concrete and raises stakes meaningfully. Yet the “before they find the bodies” clock lacks tactical urgency; it’s thematic tension rather than a live constraint shaping decisions in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repaying a cross-lifetime debt—is signaled early and deepens when the bride realizes her obligation is collective, not personal. This shift intensifies pressure and reweights her choice, satisfying the Accumulative lens. Yet escalation relies heavily on revelation (the chorus of spirits) rather than protagonist-driven agency; she reacts more than acts, slightly muting the cost’s visceral impact despite its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and deepens texturally as illustrations animate the walls. Pressure accumulates via overlapping paths and relic encounters, but no concrete option is foreclosed or trade-off dramatized; Elara never falters or sacrifices anything measurable. The “broken precedents” concept informs theme but doesn’t tighten tactics—her method remains unchanged throughout. Cost is conceptual (desolation overcome) but not felt in bodily or temporal terms.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding faith through excavation—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial base becomes the key to the tomb. Pressure tightens via Elara’s method (“purposeful wandering”) which forecloses rushing, forcing patience as cost. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her listening yields the hollow. Cost is conceptual (time, emotional vulnerability) but unmistakable in the closing mural’s affirmation of cyclical renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering hidden meaning before dawn—is signaled early and tightens slightly with the time pressure (“letter due to be mailed before dawn fully broke”). Yet the pressure never escalates into a real obstacle; Lyra deciphers, retrieves, and understands without resistance or consequence. No option is foreclosed, no cost incurred. The stakes remain intellectual rather than viscerally felt, and resolution arrives via discovery, not agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the cosmic connection via the flame—is signaled early and tightens when Lira reveals the coup targets the observatory’s gateway function. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trust, to stitch, to act. The cost is conceptual but legible: accepting that her mentor was silenced, not vanished. One tightening suffices, though the conspiracy’s mechanics remain abstract, slightly muting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens through each message revealed. The tightening occurs when Elara recognizes her own handwriting, forcing a personal reckoning. Agency drives escalation: her deliberate steps, pressing the shard, breaking the seal. Cost is felt in the silence after reading—the end of haunting—but could be sharper; the story implies emotional price without dramatizing a tangible forfeiture (e.g., leaving something behind, losing the shard’s power).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the child’s memory and hidden reef—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s decryption. The tightening occurs when she uncovers the map, narrowing her path from interpretation to active guardianship. Cost is felt in her wrist pain, emotional burden, and the irreversible commitment to become “the ocean’s voice.” Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (rekindling artistic joy) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lira chooses to paint on fog—a renunciation of galleries that forecloses her old path. Agency is clear: she activates the network, blends light with projection. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, physical isolation), though escalation leans more on discovery than active opposition. Coincidence (finding the film) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she still must act.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost art—deepens into restoring oneself through uncertainty. The tightening occurs when Elara must choose between tools (hands) and intuition (heart), foreclosing her old methodology. Cost is felt: her belief in permanence was a “cage.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (humming, nodding), though the figures’ emergence leans slightly on environmental magic rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (protecting unfettered thought) is signaled early and tightens decisively when Krane reveals infiltration—narrowing options to immediate action. Pressure coheres under Causal lens: discovery → deciphering → confrontation → mobilization. Cost is legible (“we’re being hunted”) and alters tactics (abandoning analysis for flight/convening). Deduction: the “warping” atmosphere borders on coincidental complication rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into enduring beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the poet’s sustained labor. Pressure accumulates via sleepless nights, doubt, and the physical decay of the postcard, culminating in the shell’s hum as validation. However, escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the poet never faces a true tactical shift or irreversible loss. The “blossom armistice” emerges as insight rather than a hard-won stance forged through constrained agency, softening the felt cost despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when the wind chime’s hum compels Elara beyond routine. Her agency drives escalation: she follows the echo, enters the museum, sings, and accepts the chime’s destruction. Cost is felt in her “foxglove regret” and the irreversible loss of the chime, though the price could be more concretely tied to her role (e.g., personal memory sacrificed). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening—the song—that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through truth—is signaled early and tightens via three interconnected promises that narrow Elara’s options (e.g., vowing humility forecloses defensive justifications). Escalation is protagonist-driven: each vow deepens her vulnerability under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in trembling hands and months of isolation, crystallizing in Kael’s appearance. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the inkwell responds only after earned emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing fear and curiosity—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the chain is a map. The meaningful tightening occurs at the amphitheater’s center: the glowing cracks and final poetic line force a trade-off between total protection and open access, resolved via controlled compromise. Cost is felt (his trembling, the risk of failure) but not fully visible; the villagers’ sigh of relief softens consequence. Escalation stems from Elias’s agency (deciphering, pacing, sketching), though the scholars’/villagers’ off-stage presence limits immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reframes the dust as meaningful. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she shifts from passive observation to active mapping, altering her methods and messages. The cost is legible—abandoning half-truths risks exposure but enables authenticity—and forecloses her prior refuge-as-hiding-place. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with the meteorite and pigeons serving as stakes-laden tools rather than props.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early and deepens when Elara intuits the weather codes as metaphors for emotional distance. The meaningful tightening occurs when memory reframes her father’s words, narrowing her options to acceptance or continued suffering; she chooses the former. Cost is legible: peace comes through relinquishing the logbook and the hope of reunion. Agency drives escalation—her act of intuition triggers the memory turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through rhythmic harmony—is signaled early and deepens when fireflies mirror stellar patterns. The tightening occurs at the alarm: ocean pressure forces a choice between survival and communion. Elara’s agency shines in her return to dance, accepting the cost (imminent loss of sanctuary) to honor the moment. Coincidence (fireflies appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her actions drive escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering a lost memory—is signaled early and tightens when the glass reveals the path only to dissolve it, forcing Lira to reframe success. Agency lies in her pivot from grasping images to embracing emotion, which deepens stakes conceptually. Cost is felt in the irreversible transience of the vision and her acceptance of migratory memory. Coincidence (bird-dropped seeds) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defeating monotony through creativity—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s performance. Agency lies in his attention and choreography, not physical action, fitting the Situational lens. Cost is conceptual: he lives “to happen,” forever outside ordinary rhythm. Coincidence complicates (balloon drifts, pigeons scatter) but never resolves—Elias conducts it. Tightening occurs when starlight aligns, crystallizing his role as “antidote.”

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when footsteps approach, forcing Lira to choose exposure over flight. Her agency drives escalation: uncorking the vial, writing the verse, standing tall. Cost is unmistakable: potential erasure of self. The sentinel’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lira’s stance crystallizes under coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning before change—tightens when the ripples “whisper of change,” prompting Elias’s resolve. But the escalation is atmospheric, not agentic: no obstacle tests his commitment, no trade-off forces renunciation. The “shift” remains vague, so the cost of his mission is conceptual, not felt. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, yet the absence of opposition flattens pressure despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redemption through bearing others’ sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when the box reveals fragmented lives. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the box is a vessel, not a relic, shifting his goal from absolution to connection. Cost is legible: he accepts perpetual pain but gains purpose. Escalation is driven by reflection, which, while interior, alters his stance decisively under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—quantifying hope—is signaled early and tested by the tide’s erasure. Elara’s agency lies in revitalization, not resistance; each wave forces micro-choices that narrow her tactics to adaptation alone. Cost is visible: labor erased, permanence surrendered. Escalation is textural (increasing pattern complexity), not causal, but valid under Accumulative lens. No antagonist needed—the ocean is coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling legacy by mapping intangible echoes—tightens when diaries warn “to listen is to lose oneself,” raising personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the wall despite warning, activating the chamber. Cost is felt in the burden’s transformation into purpose, though the price lacks tangible sacrifice (no tool lost, time spent, or physical toll). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibility—is signaled early and deepens when resistance forces Elara to sacrifice her own pulse. The escalation is driven by her agency: she sings louder, pours in her heartbeat, and endures the cost. The bells create a live clock that tightens tactics, and the mirrors’ surrender feels earned, not convenient. Cost is unmistakable: her trembling hands and fainter heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war through fragile human forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara ties redemption to inner transformation, not concessions. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, peaking in her vulnerable speech that forces silence. However, the leaders’ shift lacks visible resistance or tactical adaptation; their capitulation feels more thematic than pressured. Cost is legible (“ideals… chipped away”), but agency resides almost solely in Elara’s declaration, not reciprocal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct birds through the egg—is signaled early and tightens when Elara identifies the damp depression, foreclosing all other options. The deepening occurs in her decision to bury it unprotected, risking loss for potential rebirth. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and solitude, though the manufactured drought’s role as antagonist remains abstract rather than actively pressuring this scene. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, but external opposition is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—awakening the city by releasing suppressed voices—is signaled early and deepens as Elara absorbs the emotional weight of each thread. Her agency is clear: she chooses to endure the burden of memory, and the cost (loss of her former role, societal upheaval) is legible in the ending. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs via intensifying resonance, not causal turns, which is valid. Yet the danger feels abstract; no tangible consequence threatens her during the untangling, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ethical boundaries in storytelling—is signaled early and deepens when Elias questions manipulation vs. provocation. The tightening occurs in his epiphany to “rebuild,” narrowing his artistic options. However, escalation lacks tangible consequence: no lost patron, censored show, or personal rupture materializes. Cost is conceptual (“doubt”), not felt, diluting pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories amid ecological loss—is signaled early and deepens with the monarchs’ absence. Pressure escalates texturally: the grotto’s “unsettled” air, interrupted cadence, and haunting scarcity tighten the emotional register. However, escalation stems from external observation, not protagonist-driven agency; Elara responds, but doesn’t alter tactics under duress. Cost is legible (silence where wings should be), yet no live option is foreclosed—she builds, hums, departs unchanged in capacity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her task is about connection, not just preservation. The meaningful tightening occurs at the threshold of self-forgiveness: “It had to be done after forgiving yourself,” which narrows her emotional capacity to act. Cost is felt conceptually (reclaiming her own name) but not viscerally paid—no tool breaks, no time runs out. Agency is maintained throughout; luck never resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens as symbols animate. Pressure escalates via storm and pulsating seal, but Foresight faces no real resistance or trade-off; the “work” is frictionless. Agency is passive observation, not decision. Cost is conceptual (mission complete) but lacks visceral or tactical consequence—no tool lost, time forfeited, or belief shattered that alters future action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (“encrypted devotion as cosmic covenant”) is signaled early but remains abstract, never materializing as visceral pressure. The sole tightening—finding the tile—is accidental, not earned through escalating difficulty or trade-offs. No credible loss (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics; Kael faces no opposition, internal or external, that forces a costly stance. Coincidence drives discovery; agency emerges only in reflection, not action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (releasing resentment) is signaled early but never tested under pressure—Kael yields after a single memory nudge without credible resistance. No option is foreclosed; Elara faces zero risk or adaptation. The “cellular memory” method bypasses real conflict, functioning as a deus ex machina that resolves without cost. Under the Situational lens, stakes remain static declarations rather than viscerally felt pressures that force crystallization through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens when the sextant reframes it as boundary-erasure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to breathe with the cosmos, fusing fragments through embodied effort, not luck. Cost is legible in the final moment—she accepts liminality over possession, trading certainty for possibility. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail tightening the thematic vise.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom through the deciduous vow—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reinterprets breach as necessary shedding. Pressure escalates via her tools’ symbolic activation, though the rusted key’s hidden altar feels slightly coincidental. Cost is felt (emotional isolation, broken promise), but agency leans more on discovery than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering forbidden knowledge—is clear early and tightens when the cameo demands interpretation. The bathroom scene deepens stakes conceptually, but escalation lacks tangible cost: no time pressure, physical risk, or social consequence. The woman’s arrival complicates but doesn’t raise price; Elara’s “brightened disquiet” is psychological, not dramatized loss. Agency is intellectual, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are declared (“reshape reality,” “time collapsing”) but never viscerally felt; the rescue mission remains abstract. Elara’s agency is real (deciphering, plucking the bloom), but pressure escalates via discovery, not compounding cost. No credible loss alters tactics—her resourcefulness faces no meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recapturing what was lost to access the garden—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she must weave others’ stories. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra’s voice warns, “remember who you are,” forcing Elara to confront selfhood over retrieval. Yet the escalation leans on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven agency; the ship “urges her forward,” bordering on passive guidance. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely paid—no tool lost, time spent, or irreversible sacrifice shown.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s engagement with the seal and rope. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the inferred lens. Yet the cost remains abstract; no tangible sacrifice, time loss, or risk materializes. The “weight of discovery” is asserted but not dramatized, muting the stakes’ visceral impact despite a coherent thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring harmony before chaos consumes everything—is signaled early and escalates coherently as Lira moves deeper into the energy beings’ influence. The tightening occurs at the central chamber: the seed is dormant, demanding personal sacrifice (her song, her focus). Cost is legible in her weariness and the caves’ prior trembling, though the storm’s threat remains abstract rather than viscerally embodied. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the ritual demands memory sacrifice, raising personal cost. Pressure coheres under Causal lens: star-tracking fails, forcing higher-stakes action. The tightening (memory loss) forecloses Elara’s past but rekindles hope, with visible emotional toll. Yet the resolution leans on mystical rules (“retrocognitively blessed”) rather than protagonist-driven insight, slightly undercutting agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory—is signaled early and deepens when the fog-wall reveals visceral fragments, raising emotional stakes. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally; Elara’s agency is interpretive, not interventional. The tightening occurs when the wingtip shadow points to the fog-wall, prompting her to touch it—a meaningful escalation. However, no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid; the “cost” remains atmospheric, not consequential, limiting escalation impact under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and tightens when Lira chooses communal art over spectacle alone. Her agency drives escalation: spinning fire draws attention, but the mosaic crystallizes collective hope. Cost is felt in the labor (smudged hands) and implied exhaustion, though not sharply dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from solitary chant to chorus deepens stakes credibly without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating a tangential approach to chronicling—is signaled early and deepens when the cicada reveals layered time. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to close her eyes and expand senses triggers the revelation, narrowing options from doubt to conviction. Cost is felt: the “pause” with Kael carries emotional weight, and her metamorphosis implies future friction in sharing multidimensional maps. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight arises from sustained attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from suffocating safety—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at inversion: time is brief, vines fragile, return inevitable. Elara’s agency drives escalation (secret training, packing supplies), and the cost is legible: she must descend, forever altered. Yet pressure lacks concrete opposition; the father’s checks echo but never intersect her plan, making conflict feel internal-only. The inversion’s rarity raises stakes, but its rules aren’t tested under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding solace through curated silence—is signaled early and deepens as Mira’s turmoil agitates the storm glass. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he steers toward quieter sectors, times his dialogue, and selects the floating garden stop. Cost is felt (Mira’s anxiety, Elias’s vigilance) but not sharply visible as a trade-off; no path is foreclosed, only soothed. Under an Accumulative lens, this single meaningful deepening suffices, though lacks the tangible price that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via the ruby flake’s glow and mural clues. Agency is clear: Lira deciphers symbols, steps behind the waterfall, ascends. Cost is conceptual (renouncing throne-power) but not visceral; no stamina loss, time panic, or physical toll despite “endless” stairs. Escalation under Causal lens works, but stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally pressured by the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sanctuary against consuming darkness—is established immediately and deepens when Lira must sacrifice a personal link. The tightening occurs decisively at the climax: using the ring requires burning one of her own bridges, narrowing her options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable (“hollow ache,” broken bond) and arises from protagonist agency under coherent pressure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the darkness recedes only through Lira’s will and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translating emotional pressure into diamonds—is signaled early but remains abstract until the chamber scene. Escalation occurs via glitchy messages, yet agency is passive; Elara follows instructions rather than wrestles trade-offs. Cost is conceptual (past trauma) but never viscerally felt or paid on-page. Pressure tightens texturally (light intensifies, hum resonates) but lacks causal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the family’s downfall—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the journal reveals internal betrayal. This deepening reweights Eleanor’s mission from restoration to release, foreclosing revival as a path. Yet the escalation leans on revelation rather than active choice under pressure; the figure hands her the journal without resistance or dilemma. Cost is conceptual (loss of heroic narrative) but not viscerally dramatized in action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“capture the shape of possibility”) tightens when reality shifts, forcing Alaric to choose between passive withdrawal or active engagement. His unsnapping the gauntlet—a renunciation of knighthood—narrows options with clear cost (identity loss). Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: tracing vines triggers the program’s absorption. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the “murmured allegiance” is tested through his choices, not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering buried humanity in bureaucracy—is signaled early and deepens via the button’s revelation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to investigate, cross-reference, and ultimately write. The tightening occurs when she connects “L. Hayes” to the unsent letter, narrowing options from passive archiving to active storytelling. Cost is felt conceptually (Clara’s broken promise) though not viscerally paid by Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—exposing truth to combat societal indifference—is signaled early and tightens when enforcers arrive, forcing the broadcast. But escalation relies on external threat rather than Mara’s agency deepening the conflict; she adapts instantly without struggle. Cost is conceptual (risk of capture) but not viscerally felt—no tool lost, stamina spent, or moral tradeoff shown. Coincidence (perfect key fit, functional archive tech) eases resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—silencing a doom-laden prophecy—is signaled early and tightens as the grotto responds, raising the melody’s power and consequence. The saxophonist’s agency drives escalation: his playing intensifies, triggering environmental changes that culminate in the prophecy’s unraveling. Cost is felt (physical exertion, emotional burden) but not sharply visible; no concrete loss (e.g., voice, instrument, memory) alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though stakes remain ethereal.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding prophetic leaves—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone speck reframes Elara’s role from sorter to guardian. Pressure accumulates texturally via increasingly intricate monuments and archival research, culminating in a crystallized stance. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening: the speck chooses her, not vice versa, and no live option is foreclosed. Cost remains conceptual (“belonging,” “purpose”) without tangible loss, weakening stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. controlling time—is signaled early and deepens when the tinkerer chooses to follow an unreliable compass, narrowing his path from repair to discovery. The escalation is driven by his agency (improvising, descending stairs), not coincidence. Cost is felt conceptually: he abandons his workshop’s purpose, yet the story avoids showing tangible sacrifice (e.g., lost livelihood), slightly muting the price.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding names through redeemed intentions—is signaled early and deepens via furnace confrontation. Pressure escalates texturally: coin’s pulse → visions → personal revelation. Agency is clear (she chooses to enter), and cost is felt (luminous regret transforms but isn’t erased). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; redemption emerges from her stance. One tightening suffices, though a sharper trade-off (e.g., sacrificing an object) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mending souls through spectral confessions—is clear early and tightens when Elara reframes her role from collector to listener, foreclosing extraction. This renunciation deepens pressure: healing now requires vulnerability, not capture. Cost is felt in Elara’s “luminous ache” and the spent tooth, though the soul’s release lacks tangible consequence beyond dissolution. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with harp notes intensifying to weave “sorrow and hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and deepens as the forest intensifies, forcing Elara toward reckoning rather than calculation. The escalation is textural, not causal: light intensifies, presence looms, proprioception sharpens. Cost is legible in the mask’s release, though the “threshold” remains abstract. Agency resides in endurance and attention, which suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when the map reveals the tower. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each mural traced tightens Lila’s resolve. Yet agency is passive; the fragment “guides,” wind “tugs,” intuition “leads.” No meaningful trade-off occurs—no time lost, no rival claimant, no physical toll. The cost is felt only as emotional gravity, which suffices under an Accumulative lens but lacks visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost points upward, narrowing Marcus’s focus. His agency drives escalation: analyzing dust, climbing, inserting the barrel. The deepening occurs when the ceiling void reveals the frozen clock, raising emotional stakes. Cost is implied (emotional labor, confrontation with ghosts) but not visibly paid—no tool lost, time spent, or physical risk shown. Coincidence is avoided; resolution stems from his methodical action.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering ruptures to compress eternity—is signaled early and deepens when the whisper reframes reality as negotiable. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she traces the frost, uncorks the bottle, steps off the platform. The cost is conceptual (abandoning textual certainty) but unmistakable in her acceptance of chaos. One meaningful tightening suffices; however, the stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt in bodily or social terms.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating temporal plasticity to reclaim intellectual dignity—is signaled early and tightens when she risks trespassing the sealed Hall. Her agency drives escalation: devising the mirror-covering ritual and executing it alone. Cost is felt: professional exile, emotional isolation, and bittersweet victory where proof doesn’t heal inner wounds. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the storm is environmental pressure she harnesses through preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring stolen midnight light—is signaled early and tightens when Elias learns the box is tethered, not broken. His agency drives escalation: choosing to unwind the thread, journeying, then freeing (not fixing). Cost is legible: the stone’s magic is spent, its story “etched in his heart”—a quiet but felt loss. Coincidence (stranger’s vanishing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding “the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical threshold. Pressure escalates via the compass’s behavior and psychometric visions, culminating in a crystallized stance: embracing the unknown. Cost is felt (loss of heirloom, irreversible knowledge shift), though escalation leans more on revelation than active struggle or trade-offs under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the slide to bridge time—is signaled early and tightens when the arch reveals a passage, forcing Mara forward. Agency is maintained: she chooses to step into the unknown and place the slide, triggering the climax. Cost is conceptual (lifelong duty) but not viscerally felt; no stamina, time, or material loss alters her tactics. The storm’s cessation feels coincidental rather than earned by her action, slightly undercutting pressure coherence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the unseen truth of a dreamt cathedral—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s pilgrimage. Yet escalation relies on passive observation, not agency: she “reckons” by receiving, not choosing under pressure. The cost (emotional labor, solitude) is felt but not dramatized as a trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Winter’s melt provides temporal rhythm but no tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“uncover truth in tension”) but never tested under pressure; the ritual succeeds without resistance or complication. The “tightening” is temporal (sun climbing) not consequential—doubt creeps in, then vanishes when the figure appears. Agency is passive: Elara waits, pleads, and is granted access. No option is narrowed, no cost incurred; the encounter resolves via mystical generosity, not earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reviving civilization through conception, not replication—is signaled early and deepens when Elara rejects nostalgia. Escalation occurs via her working memory activating the bottle, culminating in a tangible rebirth. Cost is felt in her departure and the bottle’s dissolution. Yet the conflict lacks external resistance; pressure is internalized, reducing tactical friction despite thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional memory—is signaled early and deepens when the prophecy confirms her work continues Orchadrian legacy. The tightening occurs when symbols on the oak bark validate the recording, forcing her to act. Cost is conceptual: she accepts lifelong duty, crystallized in “I remember.” Coincidence (the field trip) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation through deliberate walking and deciphering.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the vortex to restore balance—is signaled early and tightens when the archway responds to the acorn cap. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to step through redefines possibility. However, “decreasing entropy” remains conceptual; no tactical struggle or visible price (e.g., energy drain, personal sacrifice) manifests during the act, softening cost legibility under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering atmospheric whispers before storms—is signaled early and deepens into tuning the world’s “heartbeat.” The tightening occurs when the rope twitches: a micro-anomaly that shifts Elias from passive monitoring to active engagement. His tug forecloses mere observation; he becomes a participant, paying the cost of ordinary reality for transcendent attunement. Though escalation is driven by discovery rather than opposition, it aligns with the Accumulative lens—pressure intensifies through resonance, not conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—spiritual yearning for cosmic meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the lantern activates the tracking devices. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she follows coordinates, interprets the constellation, and empathizes with stellar sacrifice. The meaningful tightening occurs when she redefines her labor as sacred stewardship. Cost is felt conceptually (the lantern’s light fades, transferring burden to her), though no tangible loss (time, tool, relationship) sharpens the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens through discovery of covenant fragments. Pressure tightens when ghosts become visible, forcing Elias to act. However, escalation relies on passive revelation (“noticed symbols,” “whispers guided him”) rather than active, costly choices. The ritual succeeds without setback or trade-off, softening the price. Agency is present but leans on accumulation over decisive confrontation with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring time’s flow—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s discovery of the urn fragment and collaboration with Thaddeus. The meaningful tightening occurs when numbers “became symbols,” raising urgency and narrowing options to direct intervention. Agency is maintained throughout: Elara initiates the garage sale gambit, interprets clues, and activates the weaver. Cost is felt in the silo’s prior decay and Elara’s existential uncertainty, though the resolution leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and deepens when the wanderer admits his loss. The tightening occurs at the kite’s discovery: its frayed string and unreadable poetry raise the emotional stakes, forcing collaboration. Agency is shown through tending and repair, not passive observation. Cost is legible in the wanderer’s humility and the poet’s openness; their synchronized work forecloses isolation. Coincidence (kite falling) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving the orchard’s purpose before death—is signaled early and tightens via Elias’s physical labor and diary entries. The six-month deadline isn’t tracked granularly, but it fuels urgency. Escalation occurs through discovery: hollow pillars with carvings deepen the mission from gardening to cultural revival. Cost is felt conceptually (his impending absence) but not viscerally in stamina or error—competence borders on ease.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is signaled early and deepens at the summit into experiential acceptance. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary ascent to shared silence with pilgrim to luminous revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara places her amber beside the larger piece—a micro-choice that forecloses analytical detachment. Cost is felt (loss of skepticism) though not dramatized as struggle; escalation relies on accumulation over causality, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield with garden—is signaled early and deepens via the coachman’s quiet persistence. Pressure escalates texturally: seed pods crumble, flowers grow taller, hope sparks. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. Cost is conceptual (time, memory, ecological loss) but not viscerally felt in choice. Bird calls guide him, but this method introduces no friction or consequence, softening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the leaf’s riddle—is signaled early and deepens into a choice about belonging. Pressure escalates through Elias’s deliberate actions (returning to the factory, operating the machine), not coincidence. The cost is conceptual but legible: solitude is relinquished for connection, foreclosing his prior path. One meaningful tightening suffices, and here it’s crystallized in the final walk back to settlement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—navigating temporal chaos via Elara’s gift—is signaled early and deepens through her realization that true north is dynamic. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the “tightening” is reflective, not active; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The cost (isolation) is stated but not dramatized in-scene—no social rejection, failed connection, or sacrificed alternative path. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of tangible consequence or narrowed possibility softens pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—amending the sky—is signaled early and tightens through the ascent, culminating in the chess match where each move reveals secrets. Agency is present: Kael chooses to play, sacrifices his queen, and lifts the lid. Yet escalation lacks genuine peril; the spire’s “cold and relentless” moves are told, not shown, and no credible loss alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (lost wonder regained) but not visceral—no stamina, injury, or irreversible forfeiture grounds the pressure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but ease of success undercuts stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—authenticity vs. performance—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s interaction with the pawnless board and Kael’s challenge. The walk ritual constitutes a meaningful tightening: each spelled word raises emotional stakes and narrows her path back to role-playing. Cost is felt in her admission of self-avoidance, though not visibly paid (e.g., no sacrifice beyond internal shift). Escalation is protagonist-driven, but the absence of tangible consequence (e.g., rejecting a role, burning a script) keeps pressure conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming buried talents to define home—is signaled early and tightens when the stone pulses, forcing Elara to act despite pain. Agency is clear: she chooses to seed thoughts via the feather, triggering escalation. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of nightly escapism, though the “storm” metaphor resolves cleanly without lingering consequence. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening via symbolic resonance suffices, but physical or social price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens when the tapestry reveals the king’s parallel sacrifice, forcing Elara to confront unintended consequences—a deepening that narrows her moral options. Agency is clear: she chooses to enter, decode, and pull the thread. Cost is felt in her tears and lifted guilt. Thunder’s lull functions as a soft clock but doesn’t actively pressure tactics; escalation relies more on interior realization than external constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—forgiveness as a refraction requiring personal sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s escalating poetry. Pressure tightens as echoes morph into accusing voices and the spire glows, forcing her toward a costly realization. The climax isn’t coincidence but agency: she chooses to declare herself “the shattered mirror,” accepting cost. However, the “price” remains conceptual rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture (e.g., leaving behind an object, voice, or memory), slightly muting the felt weight of the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—salvaging memory before dissolution—is signaled early and tightens via the “between breaths” timeframe. The workshop’s shudder and acid sea’s roar escalate pressure, forcing Elara’s narration as a last resort. Yet the climax resolves through charm-and-statue alignment that feels more mystical coincidence than protagonist-driven agency; the cost (fragile peace) is felt but not clearly tied to a prior tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a hidden promise to create something timeless—is signaled early and deepens when the seashell proves “not enough.” The wrong turn escalates pressure by forcing confrontation with the oasis, which demands a grander response. Yet agency is muted: the discovery feels fortuitous rather than earned, and the “revelation” lacks opposition or sacrifice. Cost is emotional (years of aloofness lifted) but not dramatized as a forfeiture—no tool lost, time spent, or relationship risked.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—validating quiet intent over loud assertion—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to follow the figure, risking uncertainty. The deepening occurs at the grove: the woman’s whisper confirms his thesis, closing off his self-doubt with emotional cost (solitude replaced by purpose). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation. However, the “beckoning” figure borders on deus ex machina, slightly undercutting pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating loss via the beacon—is signaled early and deepens as the moon waxes. Pressure escalates through material scarcity, mechanical failure, and lunar cycles, narrowing Mara’s window to act. The “build” imperative drives agency, not coincidence. Yet cost remains abstract: hands are “raw,” but no irreversible loss (time, safety, hope) visibly alters tactics. The waning moon hints at consequence but doesn’t enforce it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—control over truth and self—is signaled early and tightens when the eye forces involuntary honesty. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to keep it, consult Mara, perform the ritual. The cost (loss of psychological safety) is visceral and legible. Coincidence (finding the eye) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his deliberate act under pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals “The memories aren’t mine,” reframing Elias’s quest from curiosity to ethical burden. The meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes the handwriting: now he must choose whether to carry this fractured legacy. Cost is felt (“weight of the journal pressing into his palms”) and crystallizes in his decision to keep the memories safe. Agency is clear: his investigation drives every turn, and coincidence (the fresh boot print) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finding direction through hidden knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the map’s line shifts with decisions. Pressure tightens once: the archway forces a threshold crossing. Cost is conceptual (burden of guardianship) but felt in “weight of the promise.” However, escalation relies partly on coincidence (ants appearing), and Elias’s agency is reactive until the very end, limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance to bleeding starlight—is signaled early and tightens at the climax when the figure reveals her kingdom’s culpability. The queen’s agency drives escalation: her climb, her call into the void, her declaration (“I seek the truth”) all narrow options toward accountability. Cost is felt (loss of innocence, burden of leadership) but not *visibly paid* in action—she vows, but we don’t see sacrifice enacted. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, and it does, though a concrete forfeiture would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing “density of presence”—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s method. The tightening occurs when Kael joins, transforming private experiment into shared vulnerability, which reweights the moment’s meaning. But agency is passive: they “stand,” “feel,” “smile”—no decisive act forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (“carry this forever”) but not felt; no stamina, tool degradation, or relational risk alters tactics. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens yet lacking visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when the scroll pulses, forcing Elara to choose between paralysis and psychic flight. The deepening occurs in the dream confrontation: past selves challenge her envy, narrowing her options to acceptance or continued fragmentation. Cost is legible in her relinquished jealousy, now replaced by gratitude—a trade-off with emotional weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in overlooked lives—is signaled early and deepens when Elara connects her sensory loss to the screw’s history. The tightening occurs when Mira returns: Elara’s request to hold the screw isn’t passive curiosity but active humanization, narrowing her path from observer to participant. Cost is felt in Elara’s bittersweet smile—she cannot smell life’s aromas, yet perceives its emotional architecture more clearly. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; revelation emerges from sustained attention under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming emotional scars into narrative resilience—is signaled early and deepens when the quill crystallizes, narrowing options to breath control or failure. The tightening occurs at the rain’s first drop: coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Elara’s deliberate return to superstition as grounding method. Cost is felt in the scars’ reinterpretation and the relinquished belief in omens. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, though the storm’s abrupt cessation slightly softens consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with her grandmother before the orchard’s erasure—is signaled early and tightens as demolition looms. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from exorcist to penitent, channeling energy not to banish but to apologize. Cost is felt: she accepts irreversible loss while gaining emotional closure. Though agency is internal, it’s active and consequential. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the “induced currents” method lacks tactical friction, softening pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—unifying fractured existence—is signaled early but never concretely tested; conflict remains metaphysical, not dramatized. Pressure accumulates texturally (glowing pages, trembling stones), yet the witness faces no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. Agency is minimal: they “step,” “pause,” “close eyes”—receptive acts, not decisive choices with tradeoffs. Cost is implied (“weight of their task”) but never paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s essence—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s backward counting, which narrows his focus to the clock’s hidden truth. Agency is clear: his choice to stay, count, and insert the key drives escalation. The cost is conceptual (abandoning mechanical time for existential time), legible in his trembling hands and revised worldview. Yet the pressure remains largely internal; external constraints (e.g., station duties, physical limits) don’t meaningfully tighten options, capping full high-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protection vs. permeability—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes the intrusion as invitation. The meaningful tightening occurs at the clearing: her choice to lower the laser pointer forecloses her old role. However, escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven agency; the figure initiates all key turns. Cost is legible (professional identity lost), but the “revolution” lacks tactical consequence within the scene—no tool abandoned, no alert silenced—softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father’s contradictions—is signaled early and deepens when Elara interprets the subway scrawl as personal revelation. The tightening occurs at midnight: she shifts from passive collector to active writer, foreclosing aimless searching. Cost is conceptual (carrying unanswered questions) but not viscerally dramatized; escalation relies on reflection rather than external pressure. Protagonist agency drives the turn, yet the absence of tangible opposition softens the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Eli’s fear of connection versus his latent need for purpose—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when he plays the disc, foreclosing his cultivated estrangement. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each hum prompts a deeper engagement, culminating in active translation of unfinished lives. Cost is felt (exhaustion, emotional exposure) but could be sharper—e.g., a tangible loss beyond fatigue. Coincidence complicates (repeating callers) but resolution stems from Eli’s choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile human stories—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s revelation of the covenant. Yet escalation relies on exposition rather than protagonist-driven pressure: Elara “decides to steep herself” passively, and the key turn (meeting Mara) occurs off-stage before the narrative resumes. The covenant’s regeneration adapts to context, but this idea isn’t tested through Elara’s choices under constraint. Cost is conceptual (risk of forgetting) but not viscerally felt or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—curing existential loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when the clock reveals reciprocity as the mechanism. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her touch catalyzes the vision, forcing a reconfiguration of her worldview. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the search for a passive cure) and felt (laughter shifts from armor to expression). Coincidence (rumors) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn stems from her choice to reach out.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mapping uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens at the stillpoint. However, conflict is entirely internal and frictionless; no opposition, obstacle, or meaningful choice narrows options. The “trail of notes” presents no risk or cost, and resolution arrives without struggle. Agency is passive reception, not decision or renunciation, weakening escalation under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring temporal coherence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara enters the void. Pressure escalates via sensory overload and temporal fragmentation, culminating in her writing act. Yet agency feels passive: the pen “moves of its own accord,” and resolution hinges on mystical mechanics rather than earned choice. Cost is conceptual (altered history) but not felt viscerally in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when the camera clicks, transforming mapping into shaping. Agency lies in Elara’s persistent gesturing despite being forgotten; the cost is emotional (joy and sorrow intertwined) and social (irrelevance). Escalation occurs via cadence shift: gestures evolve from tracing to molding, narrowing her focus until energy is spent. Coincidence (the click) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she interprets it, then acts.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the promise—is signaled early and deepens through artistic clues. Pressure accumulates via discovery, fitting the Accumulative lens, but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs. The arsonist faces no resistance, time pressure, or sacrifice; every clue yields effortlessly. Cost is conceptual (historical truth restored) but not felt in tactics or body—no stamina loss, misstep, or dilemma sharpens the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming identity from fabricated memories—is signaled early and deepens when the lagoon reveals entanglement as bridge, not curse. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her drumming summons the lagoon’s response, which reweights her understanding and compels her new mission. The cost is conceptual (carrying others’ grief) and felt (tears “purifying, not crushing”), charging the final image. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it’s executed with lyrical precision under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—validating subtlety over force—is signaled early via Eli’s loneliness and gift. Pressure escalates coherently: the storm intensifies, the map reacts, the wall blocks, Mira challenges. Eli’s agency drives the climax: inserting the key is a decisive act under duress. Cost is felt—their solitary identity is irrevocably altered by partnership—but Mira’s role as antagonist-turned-ally slightly softens the price, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—releasing a burden in darkness—is signaled early and deepens through the stranger’s confession. Pressure escalates texturally via the guardian’s shutter-weaving and mirror work, not through causal agency; this fits the Accumulative lens. However, the stranger’s catharsis lacks a decisive trade-off or foreclosed path—their “lighter shoulders” feel consequence-free. Cost is implied but not dramatized (e.g., no visible sacrifice or irreversible admission).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—sparking “humble rebellion” through contemplation—is declared but never tested by opposition or complication. Elias faces no obstacles, trade-offs, or failures; the plan succeeds by fiat. Agency is passive (organizing, gathering) without renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path. The “amplified quiet” of the town on display night reflects ambient tone, not earned consequence of his actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-acceptance—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw demands detachment. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the call, steps onto the island, and releases the scrimshaw. Cost is felt (loss of the object, dissolution of the island) and alters her return to the docks. However, the “guarded heart” barrier dissolves too cleanly; a sharper trade-off (e.g., permanent exile, physical toll) would heighten pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—authentic emotion vs. enforced joy—is signaled early and tightens when Elara recalls her brother’s death, raising personal cost. Pressure escalates through internal reflection that alters tactics: whittling shifts from mechanical to purposeful resistance. Agency is credible (renunciation via private ritual), though external opposition remains abstract (the mandate is felt but not personified). Cost is felt in the “emotional void” she inhabits, legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—dismantling soul-confining walls—is signaled early and deepens when the poet’s recitation cracks the lake “with grace of transformation.” Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: stepping in, touching quartz, speaking. Cost is conceptual (loss of fixed identity) and visible (altered lake). Yet pressure remains atmospheric rather than oppositional; no live option is foreclosed mid-scene, only transcended. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but stakes lack visceral urgency—they’re asserted (“courage to dismantle”) more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty beyond color—is signaled early and deepens when the concertina awakens, forcing Elias to shift from passive observation to active creation (bartering with music). The tightening occurs in his fern-and-daisy arrangement, a tactical escalation that risks vulnerability. Cost is felt in his surrender of artistic control to unseen forces, crystallizing in the glassblower’s validation. Coincidence (reed vibrating) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Elias’s cunning response.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost connection through sound—is signaled early and deepens as each sound reveals duality of progress. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Elara’s agency lies in attention and interpretation; her choice to listen forecloses passive forgetting. Cost is felt (exhaustion) and conceptual (confronting progress’s hidden losses), though no concrete option is irrevocably lost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling grief with creative purpose—is signaled early and deepens when the curtains activate, forcing Elara to choose between clinging to memory or embodying it. The tightening (stencil glowing → tattooing) narrows options: she must act or remain static. Cost is felt (years of subdued ardor lifted) but could be sharper; the resolution leans hopeful without tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering systemic deception—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s data merges with cartomancy. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara quantifies loss via tape (“each inch = $1M”), transforming abstract collapse into visceral scale. Agency is clear: their collaboration forecloses ignorance. However, the antagonistic force remains off-stage, limiting reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge at personal cost—is clear early and deepens when Elara recognizes that avoiding patterns means seeing erasure. Her agency drives escalation: she deciphers, kneels, speaks the word. Cost is felt (“blurring of lines between truth and obsession”) and crystallizes in Charged Poise. Yet the “steadily unpredictable” archive resolves too neatly, softening pressure just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—giving form to the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s archival work. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to engage the vial directly, risking emotional overwhelm. Cost is felt (“luminous regret”) and visible in her relinquishing the stone. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal and lacks external consequence or tangible loss beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing trust after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s introspection. However, escalation occurs internally without external pressure or opposition; the “con” is a static backdrop, not an active force. The meaningful tightening comes via thematic density, not narrowed options or raised cost, fitting an Accumulative lens but lacking visceral urgency or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost selfhood through forgotten truth—is signaled early and tightens via the tunnel journey. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the plants, enter the tunnel, and reunite the hourglasses. Cost is felt (raw wounds, fading scars), but the “displaced miracle” concept resolves too abstractly; the stakes deepen emotionally yet lack concrete tactical consequence beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when the film reveals itself as a repository. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to incubate, then to remove the strip, foreclosing its abandonment. Cost is felt (“more questions than answers,” personal reckoning with unspoken loves) but not fully materialized as a concrete forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from still frames to merging letters constitutes sufficient intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring vibrancy by reclaiming stardust—is signaled early and deepens through the aurora’s intensifying song and the astrolabe’s response. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: her tracing of falling stars triggers the archway’s awakening, narrowing her path to pursuit. Cost is felt (shadowed rapture, isolation, the weight of generational duty) but not yet paid; Charged Poise makes stakes legible. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving hope in a post-apocalyptic world—is signaled early and tightens when the archive is revealed to be dying. Mara’s use of the charm constitutes agency that deepens the conflict, leading to the clock’s activation. But escalation lacks cost: the archive’s revival is frictionless, and no trade-off occurs. The “divergence” of new jars introduces possibility without consequence, softening the stakes rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering insight in a world that mirrors the mind—is signaled early and deepens through escalating phenomena (translocations, responsive flora). The tightening occurs when Eamon places the gear, narrowing all wandering into one decisive act. Cost is felt in his chronic disorientation and the surrender of passive searching for active guardianship. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (wind’s song) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the machine requires his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens via the ferryman’s refrain and the blanking ticket. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes the stamp has transferred, forcing her to “use it.” Agency drives escalation: her walk, her question, her final punch. Cost is felt (abandoning the ticket, ending the vigil), though external pressure remains light—fitting for an internal, accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—weighing safety against truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elias learns the fortress’s secret. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to investigate, touch the bolt, and finally play. The cost (bearing unbearable knowledge) is felt in the bolt’s weight and his transformed role. One tightening suffices, though the shift from passive endurance to active expression could be more pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and escalates via Elara’s increasingly bold messages. Each annotation exchange tightens pressure, culminating in the pretender’s physical appearance. Agency is clear: Elara drives escalation through deliberate acts, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the pretender’s desperation and public collapse, though Elara’s personal sacrifice remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths vanish—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s research assembly, culminating in a meaningful reconfiguration of historical responsibility. Pressure tightens when the watermark transforms the page from relic to warning. Agency is present in her active synthesis, though the “turn” relies on discovery rather than decision. Cost is conceptual (the weight of ignored warnings) and legible, but not tied to a tactical sacrifice or narrowed future path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reigniting hope in defeat—is signaled early and deepens via the stone circle’s hum, which transforms Lira’s perception. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her kneeling, touching, looking. Yet the “lull in rebellion” remains abstract; no tactical consequence (lost allies, dwindling supplies) tightens options. Cost is felt emotionally (“spirits broken”) but not viscerally paid—no sacrifice, only revelation. Still, the thematic trade-off (quiet courage over battle) is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition against regime suppression—is signaled early and tightens when the guard appears, raising personal risk. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to decode, then to press the embryo, accepting potential capture. Cost is felt in her breathlessness and the guard’s vanished presence, implying future danger. Yet the guard’s quick capitulation softens opposition, making the regime’s threat feel abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency amid grief—is signaled early and deepens when the photograph nearly falls, forcing Zara to confront loss physically. Her agency emerges through attention and endurance, not action; the tightening occurs at the cliff edge, where survival instinct meets artistic impulse. Cost is felt in the trembling sketch that follows. Coincidence (wind snatching photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Zara’s recovery is earned through somatic control.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming creative truth amid fragmentation—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s tactile engagement with the cards. The meaningful tightening occurs when she stops trying to restore the box and begins rearranging disorder into new narrative, foreclosing the path of control. Agency is clear: her mental redesign drives the shift, not external luck. Cost is felt in the ache-turned-muse, though it remains conceptual; a more visceral forfeiture (e.g., destroying a painting, burning a sketch) could have intensified stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s distortion in crisis—is signaled early and tightens when the ink reveals her brother’s final moments, foreclosing her desire to undo his death. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she releases the drone, enters the tent, touches the vial. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts irreversible loss. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the woman’s presence is plausible within the encampment’s whispered lore.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. order—is signaled early and tightens when Elara accesses the network, foreclosing her path as protector. The escalation is driven by her agency, and cost (betrayal, isolation, impending consequences) is felt. Yet the “ticking clock” is mentioned but not operationalized; no concrete barrier or narrowing of time forces a harder choice. The deepening comes via revelation, not rising external pressure, slightly softening the causal escalation under the inferred Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving peace amid chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Kael warns of imminent danger. Elara’s renunciation of total nonviolence (accepting the blade) narrows her path with felt cost. Yet escalation relies on external warning rather than protagonist agency; the tightening is reactive, not driven by her decisions. Still, the moral trade-off is credible and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring the goddess’s echo to stabilize the cosmos—is signaled early and deepens when the constellations freeze, raising pressure. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his zigzag walk mirrors the stars, inviting the goddess’s appearance. The cost is legible in the goddess’s departure despite the echo’s return—a bittersweet trade-off. However, the resolution leans slightly on mystical convenience (the spike’s sudden utility), softening the tactical price just enough to prevent a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing truth versus personal safety—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor learns of the vanished journalist. Her agency escalates from documentation to direct intervention, narrowing options. But the cost remains conceptual (“orbits of regret”) rather than visceral; no concrete loss (time, access, social capital) alters her tactics, softening escalation under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hushing dissonance rooted in guilt—is clear early and tightens when Elara reads Lyra’s letters, forcing a choice: continue hiding or respond as the lost child. This act deepens the conflict by confronting, not avoiding, pain. The firmware’s shift reflects earned escalation through protagonist agency. Cost is felt: she reopens trauma to transmute it, though the resolution leans slightly lyrical over visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in unlearning—is signaled early and deepens when the tile flake reveals the grotto’s tragic history. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her interjection initiates the mandala’s transformation, and her whispered question elicits the hand-image. The cost is felt as persistent unease and the burden of carrying silenced voices forward. Yet the “unlearning” timeframe exerts abstract rather than tactical pressure; stakes remain philosophical over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—renaming mercy as foundational—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s tactile engagement with the mosaic. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses reconstruction over lamentation, foreclosing passive grief. Cost is conceptual (labor, historical burden) but not visceral; no tangible sacrifice (time, safety, tool) alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from ruin to renewal suffices, but the absence of oppositional force or internal resistance flattens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a version of oneself from despair—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s synesthetic reading of the woman’s emotions. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: offering the coin forces a choice that narrows options (acceptance or continued isolation). Cost is unmistakable in Mara’s “bittersweet smile” and lingering solitude, though the antagonist (despair) remains abstract rather than dramatized through concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—illuminating fractured telepathy—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s nocturnal creation. Agency is clear: her deliberate setup forecloses passive despair. Yet escalation lacks a tangible trade-off; no stamina loss, tool failure, or time pressure tightens choices. The “static shock” backdrop complicates but doesn’t concretely raise on-page cost, limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to forgotten emotions—is signaled early and deepens when the fossil reveals hidden history. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Elara chooses to study, follow, and place the fossil. The tightening occurs when she shifts from observer to inheritor, narrowing her path to stewardship. Cost is felt conceptually (eternal responsibility) but lacks visceral or material consequence; the caves reward rather than resist her.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost wisdom—is signaled early and deepens as buttons coalesce into pattern. The tightening occurs when the bone button syncs with the jar, escalating echo to chorus. Agency is maintained: Elara’s method drives the turn. Yet cost remains conceptual (responsibility) rather than visceral; no tangible loss or trade-off alters her tactics. Coincidence is avoided, but pressure peaks without irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming courage—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reframes courage as memory, not discovery. This tightens options: she must act without the pill. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each code and object adding weight. Yet the “codes in snow” method introduces coincidence (someone knew her path), slightly undercutting agency. Cost is felt—she abandons reliance on the pill—but the external conflict lacks tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering layered truth—is signaled early and deepens via the figure’s revelation that the promise is not external but perceptual. The tightening occurs when the coachman realizes the needle is symbolic, foreclosing his quest for a physical key. Agency lies in his internal recalibration, driven by ambient awareness, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of naive seeking, though it remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist time—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the glass reveals fractured timelines. Pressure escalates through her pottery practice and communal turn, but the “meaningful tightening” is under-dramatized: we’re told she teaches villagers, not shown the friction of that outreach. Cost is implied (time, effort) but not viscerally rendered; the oasis heals smoothly, softening consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning/connection in transience—is signaled early (“after the final petal dropped”) and deepens when the boat arrives. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, speak, and offer the tooth. The cost is emotional exposure, crystallized in the lockmaster’s admission (“piece of me”). However, the lockmaster’s lost object lacks concrete stakes—it resolves too cleanly via coincidence, slightly undercutting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when memories surface. The tightening occurs at the stone door: only the sundial unlocks it, forcing Elena to commit fully. Agency is clear—she chooses to place her hand on the orb—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over struggle; the library “tests” her, yet no real failure or setback occurs. Cost is conceptual (loss of solitary identity) but palpable in the sync of her heartbeat with the orb, reweighting her existence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the universal connecting thread—is signaled early and deepens at the installation. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the “resonance” is passive revelation, not earned through struggle. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The thrush’s nest fits “perfectly,” removing friction. Coincidence (hidden groove) resolves rather than complicates, violating Situational/Accumulative guardrails. Cost is implied (“heart lighter”) but not legible as loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding a cosmic message before societal collapse—is signaled early and tightens when Hank demands a fix, forcing Elara to act covertly. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses interference over silence, provoking no retaliation but deepening communal division. Cost is felt (lost sponsors, protests) and shapes the ending’s poise. Yet the cosmic “tricksters” remain abstract; their threat lacks tangible consequence beyond static, weakening the pressure’s visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking spatial mutiny to resolve personal trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the compass points upward, forcing Elara into a suffocating passage. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to squeeze through despite panic, then embracing mutiny. The cost is felt (psychic toll of confinement) and visible in the transformed chamber. Yet the “spatial mutiny” concept lacks concrete on-page mechanics, reducing the tactical weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy for Lila—is signaled early and deepens when the figure offers a second ribbon, transforming investigation into confrontation with absence itself. Pressure tightens once: the encounter forces Elara to choose between defense (lancing tool) and creation (sketching), crystallizing her stance. Cost is conceptual (the unsolved case persists) but not viscerally felt; escalation relies on atmospheric tension more than protagonist-driven agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reversing the exile to restore legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the truth wasn’t failure but dangerous discovery. Pressure escalates causally: journal decoding → map revelation → ritual activation. The cost is felt (“what would it cost?”) and crystallizes in the uncle’s warning: “restore or protect.” Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Yet the “choice” at climax lacks explicit trade-off mechanics, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hitchhiker’s secret—is signaled early and deepens when the flake becomes a map. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: clues align effortlessly with landscape, no missteps occur, and “scaffold wrap” logic resolves cleanly without prior trial. Cost is conceptual (“ashes of never”) but not felt in stamina, time, or risk; the journey imposes no meaningful hardship. Coincidence (images matching peaks) aids rather than complicates, softening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—is signaled early and deepens through discovery. Pressure escalates via the journal and encounter with the scavenger, but the latter resolves too easily, undercutting tension. The meaningful tightening occurs in Elias’s shift from curiosity to acceptance, foreclosing further searching with quiet cost. Agency is present but muted; stakes remain internal and abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to heal personal and collective wounds—is signaled early and deepens through thematic accumulation. Pressure escalates via pattern recognition (stars ↔ symbols ↔ temple layout), culminating in the realization that “no burden was meant to be carried alone.” However, agency is observational, not interventional; Elara witnesses, interprets, but never risks or loses anything concrete. Cost is emotional (solitude ending), but lacks visible forfeiture or irreversible trade-off under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when the seed reveals it holds the lake’s *and* Eira’s frozen confession. Pressure escalates coherently: chaotic vortex threatens forest, forcing Eira to confront her past. Her agency drives escalation—choosing to enter, to dance, to unbend—and cost is felt in her relinquished armor of serenity. Coincidence (finding the seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her vulnerable act.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (mending the eclipsed covenant) is signaled early, and pressure accumulates texturally via glowing scars and whispering hedges. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—Elara follows cues rather than makes costly decisions that alter tactics. The “treacherous path” and “scars” suggest prior cost, but no live option is foreclosed during this sequence. Coincidence (the clipping guiding her) resolves navigation, undercutting earned tension despite lyrical buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending souls at the cost of self—is signaled early and tightens when the roots form the tarot pattern, forcing confrontation. The deepening comes via the doppelgänger’s revelation: the true price was freedom, not the card. Elara’s agency drives escalation—she follows the roots, stands firm—and the cost (permanent entrapment) is felt in her quiet smile at the end. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering purpose after professional and emotional collapse—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s confrontation with the speaker scrap. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from passive rumination (“What was he supposed to do?”) to active resolve (“wrest his story back”). Cost is felt: he accepts enduring emptiness while choosing hope. However, escalation relies more on reflection than external pressure; the auction failure remains off-stage, reducing immediacy. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but agency lacks a decisive on-page test of his old vs. new self.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition to heal haunted ambition—is signaled early and deepens when Eliara risks planting the seed. The meaningful tightening occurs at that moment: she trades caution for faith, narrowing her path to one of active cultivation. Cost is felt in her trembling and later realized as emotional liberation. Escalation stems from her agency (analogical thinking → action), though the arbor’s reactive “surge” flirts with convenient environment-as-deus.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving coherent identity in a destabilizing world—is clear from the inciting anomaly. Pressure escalates as tracking fails and identities migrate unpredictably, forcing Elara to abandon routine for improvisation. Her act of dissolving the orb into the pool constitutes a meaningful deepening that reweights the system. Cost is felt conceptually (loss of original forms) but lacks visceral or social consequence on the page; the resolution leans heavily on thematic resonance over tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming bunkers from shelters into sanctuaries—is signaled early and deepens when the crown reframes Elara’s mission. Escalation occurs via the pearl’s pull and the crown’s activation, driven by Elara’s agency. But cost remains abstract: no time lost, no risk incurred, no tradeoff made. The “heartbeat of hesitation” implies urgency but yields no consequence, softening the pressure required for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from collecting others’ stories to confronting her own. The meaningful tightening occurs when she unfolds her self-drawn map, narrowing her quest from external clues to internal reckoning. Cost is felt (unfiltered memory’s ache) but not visibly paid beyond emotional weight; the man’s appearance risks coincidence, though his line (“map isn’t about where you’re going”) crystallizes pressure rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens when the watch hums and the quill compels writing, narrowing her role from seeker to conduit. The deepening occurs via the cipher’s revelation that words are alive and waiting, raising the conceptual cost of silence. Yet escalation leans on environmental cues rather than protagonist-driven agency; she follows rather than chooses under duress, slightly softening the pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (dream vs. empire) is signaled early and tightens when coffee stains reveal the split tree, forcing Elara’s hand. Her agency drives escalation—she chooses to play the violin despite Dominion presence. Cost is felt: the violin’s sacrifice and persistent ache. However, the Dominion remains abstract; their scouts freeze but pose no dynamic opposition, reducing external pressure to symbolic threat rather than active complication.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler awakens, reframing Elara’s entire method. The deepening (“sparks are fleeting; stillness endures”) forces a conceptual trade-off: control vs. surrender. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and relinquished purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (using the chip), though the reversal leans on revelation rather than struggle—still valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s climb and the hairpin’s map. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to retrieve the pin, follow the map, and enter the lake. Yet the cost remains conceptual rather than tangible; no resource, relationship, or opportunity is visibly forfeited. The tightening (“world felt smaller… discontent clearer”) is psychological, not situational, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a concrete trade-off that would elevate it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—liberating Mara from absolutism—is clear early, and the deepening (chimes revealing balance) narrows the thematic path. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: Elias listens, interprets, writes. No obstacle tests his method or forces adaptation. Cost is conceptual (“beauty in brokenness”) but not felt; the cloak of doubt dissolves without resistance, reducing stakes to philosophical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to reveal her discovery—is signaled early and tightens decisively when ripples show her frustrated colleagues. The deepening comes via trance-induced confrontation with past selves, forcing a trade-off: maintain control or risk chaos for truth. Cost is felt (“heart heavy but unburdened”), though the external consequences remain abstract; escalation relies more on internal pressure than tangible loss, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the arrowhead’s purpose through avian patterns—is signaled early and deepens into a redefinition of navigation itself. Escalation occurs via sensory accumulation (light fading, flock arriving, vibrations syncing), not protagonist agency, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: abandoning instrumental utility for metaphysical guidance, legible in Kael’s inward turn at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—proving heart-driven magic matters—is signaled early and tightens when the walls close, forcing Eli to risk mist walking. The escalation is protagonist-driven, but the harness succeeds without prior demonstration of competence, reducing felt cost. The price—enduring a world that dismisses him—is legible in the ending, though not viscerally dramatized during the climax. One meaningful deepening occurs (keystone’s true power revealed), satisfying length expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early via Elias’s unnamed longing and solidified by the book’s revelation. The tightening occurs when the key tag glows and the blank page awaits his vow, forcing commitment. Cost is conceptual (binding himself to an elusive quest) and felt (“tug in his chest” becomes duty), though not visceral. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, open the book, and speak the vow—no external force compels him, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the backwards prophecy to rebirth the universe—is signaled early and tightens when distillation yields actionable insight. Agency is maintained: Lira chooses to submerge each coin, narrowing options toward alignment. However, escalation leans on revelation (liquid shows images) rather than compounding pressure or loss; no tangible price (time, stamina, tool degradation) alters tactics. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but the stakes’ cosmic scale isn’t viscerally felt in moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and deepens when the atlas activates, forcing Elara to confront collective sacrifice. The tightening occurs when whispers coalesce into stories, raising the cost from personal grief to inherited burden. Her agency drives escalation: placing the page, speaking names, accepting the weight. Coincidence (finding the page) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to voice the unvoiced. Cost is felt in her tremor, kneeling, and transformed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance through mending devotion—is signaled early and deepens via the bell’s physical and symbolic fragility. Eliard’s agency drives escalation: cleaning, alloying, striking. The “plausible impossibility” raises stakes without resolving via luck. Cost is felt (crack remains, sound is dull), but the tightening isn’t sharp—a live option (abandonment? alternative ritual?) isn’t clearly foreclosed by mid-story choices.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—combating communal amnesia—is signaled early and deepens through the photograph trail. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias shifts from observer to curator, transforming passive vigilance into active remembrance. Cost is conceptual (lost history reclaimed) but not viscerally felt; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path sharpens the stakes. Agency is present but unchallenged—no opposition tests his resolve, making escalation feel gentle rather than pressured under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is clear early and tightens when Elara chooses intuition at the altar despite logical doubt. The cost is conceptual: surrendering pure rationality for integrated knowing. Yet pressure remains abstract; no tangible loss (time, tool, safety) alters tactics. The flame complicates but doesn’t escalate—its beckoning feels fated, not adversarial. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the deepening of thematic pressure suffices, but agency leans passive.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (“decipher chaos to restore order”) is signaled early and tied to trust preservation, but escalation is textural rather than causal: pressure accumulates via atmosphere, not narrowed options. The seeker’s “revision” of understanding deepens insight but doesn’t foreclose alternatives or impose tangible loss. Cost is implied (“breaking trust”), yet no on-page sacrifice or irreversible consequence tightens the final beat. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices for moderate escalation, but lacks the decisive trade-off needed for high-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional vitality—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lira presents the swords, forcing Kael to act. The duel deepens pressure by transforming internal struggle into physical ritual, and the cost (risk of permanent fragmentation or surrender to numbness) is legible in Kael’s trembling and the brain’s glow. Yet escalation leans on metaphor over concrete narrowing of options; the brain’s “movements” lack tactical consequence, and history’s rewriting outside never pressures Kael’s decisions, making the conflict feel insulated rather than urgent under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding a sanctuary for the impossible—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the seed demands ritual planting and later surrender into the brook. Pressure escalates through Elias’s own choices: studying, designing puzzles, then relinquishing control by dropping the key. The cost is conceptual (a life reoriented toward mystery) and felt in the “silence closing like a promise.” Coincidence never resolves; every complication stems from his engagement with the seed’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and sustained, with one meaningful deepening: the realization that the household is “the world itself.” Pressure accumulates texturally via sound and echo, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation relies on sensory intensification rather than protagonist-driven agency altering stakes; Eli repeats his method without adaptation. Cost is implied (exhaustion, cracked voice) but never crystallizes into a concrete forfeiture that reshapes later action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the library versus returning home—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the keeper reveals the pendant’s cost. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her deepening connection triggers the pendant’s glow, which summons the keeper, forcing the trade-off. The cost is unmistakable: she chooses ongoing exile to protect the garden. No false intensifiers; pressure grows organically from object, setting, and character motive under a Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—defying destiny by creating life from destruction—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reinterprets “vivify.” Pressure tightens once: her decision to use the crozier as catalyst forecloses resurrection attempts, embracing transformation instead. Cost is felt (abandoning old goals) and visible (sapling from ashes). However, escalation leans on internal realization rather than external pressure; the world “holds its breath” but doesn’t resist her, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the beginning in every ending—is signaled early and deepens via two meaningful tightenings: discarding “silence is empty” and “shard’s power is finite.” Agency drives escalation; lunar perigee acts as live clock narrowing options. Cost is visible in faltering melody and required epistemic surrender, though external pressure remains atmospheric rather than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—saving the ferry and its passengers—is signaled early and tightens when Mara learns the rift demands personal sacrifice. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter despite warning, and the cost (bodily weakening, existential strain) is visible. However, the “endless loop” revelation feels slightly expository rather than discovered through struggle, and the reset lacks tactical evolution—it’s a single act, not a deepening series of trade-offs. Pressure coheres but doesn’t intensify beyond initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow-man questions if connection “unravels you.” Elara’s choice to weave deeper narrows her options (risking entrapment) and alters the gallery’s reality. Cost is felt: her memories fracture, and she emerges changed. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the shadow-man’s role borders on convenient catalyst rather than fully pressured opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving celestial navigation amid alien-induced obsolescence—is signaled early and deepens when the Council moves to decommission towers. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she mounts the chain, gathers students, creates a hybrid ritual. The cost is conceptual (erasure of human legacy) and social (defying authority), though physical or emotional price remains abstract. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens, culminating in institutional change (towers retained).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and deepens when the whisper demands “Find the last photograph.” Pressure escalates texturally: mist thickens, whispers close in, pulses intensify. Elara’s agency is active (she tracks, searches, retrieves), and the cost is conceptual—bearing witness to unresolved grief. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the path remains linear, with no real obstacle or trade-off beyond atmospheric unease.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the codex to understand Voss’s fate—is signaled early and tightens when the fleck pulls Elena into the liminal realm, forcing a conceptual trade-off: knowledge vs. reverence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (prying open the vault, touching the codex), and the deepening (seeing Voss in the cables) reweights the entire mission. Cost is felt in her acceptance of mystery over resolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the tidal shift aiding her exit feels earned by prior world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating existence against systemic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reveals “paths untaken.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: her defragmentation work aligns ink, shard, and code, narrowing options from confusion to revelation. Cost is legible: she mourns a self that never was, yet gains wisdom. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern convergence (ink + data + shard), not causal turns. Slight softness: the ghost’s arrival feels more like resonance than earned consequence of specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—saving the language via texture-to-sound translation—is signaled early and tightens when the diamond’s curse drains Lira mid-ritual, forcing her to harness the birds’ rhythm as her last resource. This deepening narrows her options and raises cost (physical depletion). Agency is maintained: she chooses to press on despite waning strength. However, the birds’ intervention borders on convenient; had their pattern been seeded earlier as a cultural memory or ancestral signal, the escalation would feel more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving cryptid origins to redeem grief—is signaled early and deepens into a personal reckoning. Pressure escalates via the arrowhead’s pull and the phone’s command, forcing Lena’s climactic choice: release bitterness or cling to control. The “metamorphose” directive acts as a tightening that narrows options to internal surrender. Cost is legible in the dormant arrowhead and heavier phone—tangible residues of transformation. Yet the cryptids’ awakening feels externally imposed, slightly diluting protagonist agency in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty against mechanical oppression) tightens decisively when Elara synchronizes her heartbeat with the orchard, narrowing options to a single, costly method. Agency is clear: her choice to use the shell triggers the climax. Cost is felt—the shell’s depletion—and pressure escalates via protagonist-driven action (music → sync → roots). However, the statues’ defeat relies slightly on environmental convenience (roots acting autonomously), softening the price of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mending broken promises—is signaled early and deepens when the bottle glows mid-flight, raising tension. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he pilots Luma through surveillance, evades a patrol drone, and chooses to deliver hope despite personal loss. Cost is felt (his enduring sorrow) and visible (the half-full satchel). However, the patrol drone chase resolves too cleanly—Luma’s “knack” borders on convenient competence without meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming silence into expressive possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the carpenter sings. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitude to discovery to activation. Yet the escalation leans on environmental cues (wind bells, fragment’s warmth) rather than protagonist-driven agency; he follows prompts rather than wrestles with obstacles. The cost—carrying hope forward—is felt but not dramatized as sacrifice; no path is visibly foreclosed, softening the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving analog story-space—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s escalating rituals. Each rearrangement deepens pressure, culminating in the Möbius strip that triggers the library’s awakening. The cost (a fading realm requiring eternal vigilance) is conceptually clear, but the absence of tangible sacrifice (time, safety, relationships) keeps emotional stakes just below visceral. Agency is strong; no coincidence resolves the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s hybrid method. Pressure escalates via atmospheric anomaly (pulsing light), which compels her decisive act of painting over the photograph. Cost is felt: years of longing culminate in renunciation of the original dream for creative rebirth. However, the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (the light “just happens” to pulse), reducing agency; the tightening is more perceptual than tactical, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped by fear—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s confrontation with inherited trauma. Pressure tightens via the vault’s resistance and the hair’s activation, forcing her to act despite lifelong hesitation. However, the resolution leans on inherited knowledge (mother’s phrase) rather than earned agency, and the cost remains conceptual (“everything felt different”) without tangible loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the locket reveals ancestral connection. Pressure tightens via the missing mushroom, prompting Elara’s dig, which narrows options to one path. Yet escalation relies partially on coincidence (locket buried exactly where memory was lost), slightly undercutting protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt (emotional void) but not actively paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped shadows through annotation—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror’s shadow “mocks” Elara, raising emotional cost. Her agency drives escalation: brewing tea, reading leaves, writing. The deepening occurs when words “flow like a river,” softening the shadow—a clear cause/effect under Accumulative lens. However, the “reversible exile” concept remains abstract; the price of failure isn’t dramatized, muting stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and maintained, but pressure never escalates into genuine opposition; decay is abstract, not active. The “hush of budding hope” timeframe creates atmospheric tension but imposes no tactical constraint—Elara acts at leisure. Protagonist agency is passive: she receives the seed’s warmth, listens to whispers, follows inherited words. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual succeeds exactly as intended, with no adaptation or consequence beyond ambient renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—grounding spirits through knot-unraveling—is signaled early and deepens via accumulated silence and resistant knots. The stubborn knot creates meaningful pressure, forcing Elara’s whispered plea. However, agency is passive: spirits “unwilling to let go” externalizes conflict, and resolution comes via flood of whispers, not protagonist-driven reversal. Cost is felt (emotional weight), but escalation relies on environmental intensification rather than protagonist-compelled tightening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reopening buried truth—is signaled early and tightens when video comparison reveals misalignment. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to dig, frame by frame, despite solitude and skepticism. Cost is emotional (reverence, burden of guardianship), not material, but legible in her “heavy” heart. No false resolution; world doesn’t shift—the henge was always over the chapel.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding how to let go—is signaled early and deepens when the sailor’s letter reframes the snow globe as a practice of release, not preservation. This revelation narrows Elara’s options: she must either cling or surrender. Her agency drives the escalation (choosing to follow the map, read the letter, place the globe down). Cost is felt in the quiet finality of her departure; the library’s transformed silence marks what she leaves behind. Coincidence never resolves pressure—every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—articulating the ghost’s unspoken need—is signaled early and deepens through encoding. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elara deciphers, builds, encodes, and sings. The tightening occurs when the bolt plate is recognized as a key, narrowing options to a single ritual. Cost is felt in the ghost’s dissolution and Elara’s renewed burden (“work was far from over”). Coincidence complicates (graffiti appears) but resolution is earned through her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—deciphering joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated pages and riddles. Yet pressure remains static; Elara faces no real opposition, time constraint, or tactical trade-off. The elevator’s ascent provides structure but not urgency. Cost is felt emotionally at the end, but no on-page loss (time, stamina, opportunity) alters her tactics mid-quest.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and deepens when the glowing cumulus appears as direct evidence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she sketches, interprets, and ultimately leaps, transforming passive observation into active communion. The cost is conceptual (she assumes eternal guardianship) and physical (risking death), though the latter is softened by the gondola’s magical repair. Coincidence complicates (the string breaks) but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from her choice to trust her theory.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the infinite within the finite—is signaled early and deepens as Elara deciphers the coin and recreates constellations. Pressure escalates via the building’s decay, culminating in collapse during her final stroke. Agency is clear: her crafting drives the climax. Cost is felt (risk of death, time, physical peril) and visible in her trembling hands and clutching the book. One tightening suffices, but the escalation could heighten tension earlier beyond atmospheric cues.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled early and deepens when the board becomes a compass. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her noting triggers the glow, which leads to the hatch. However, the luminance appears without struggle; no real obstacle is overcome, and the cost remains abstract (loneliness). Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, but the lack of tangible price caps escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and deepens when the prophecies reveal a path to the hall of mirrors. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers, navigates, enters, and endures the vortex of selves. The cost is conceptual but legible: she must relinquish linear selfhood to grasp interconnected time. However, the conflict leans more on atmospheric pressure than tangible opposition; the “stakes” remain abstract until the mirrors force confrontation, slightly muting visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the nebula—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. Obstacles are environmental (overgrowth) or mnemonic (lost clapper), not oppositional or costly. Agency is diffuse: Kael initiates, but success hinges on allies’ convenient expertise, not hard-won trade-offs. The bell’s ringing resolves everything without complication—coincidence (Jorin remembering the clapper) solves the core problem, violating “luck may complicate but not resolve.”

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preventing the clock from striking midnight—is signaled early and deepens when doubt threatens Elara’s lullaby. Escalation is driven by her agency: pressing blood into shards, humming through faltering. Cost is legible in physical pain and emotional vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and rhythmic intensification rather than causal narrowing, which fits the design but slightly softens tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking or enduring the curse—is signaled early and deepens when the nut reveals the blueprint. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets impressions, assembles the map, risks interception. Cost is felt in exhaustion, danger, and the mechanical birds’ hostility. Under causal lens, each choice narrows options: once she acts on the map, retreat is impossible. Coincidence (traveler’s cry) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must choose.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into connection—is signaled early and deepens via the river foam insight. Pressure tightens once: the realization that separation can be generative. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the turn is observational, not tactical. No live option is foreclosed, and cost remains emotional rather than enacted, limiting pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled early and deepens when the moonlight vial pulses with “rhythm that seemed to echo the clouds.” Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: fragmentation intensifies with each stair climbed, culminating in the blank book. Elara’s agency drives escalation—her incision triggers the climax—but the cost (“empty vial”) feels symbolic rather than visceral. Coincidence (vial “placed there by someone”) slightly undercuts earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming remorse into bearable lessons—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara confronts her own buried regrets at the shard. Agency is clear: each act of subsuming is a choice that narrows her emotional burden. Cost is felt in the lingering sorrow and the pavilion’s dissolution. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the transition from others’ to her own remorse lacks a distinct tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating community bonds—is signaled early, but pressure remains abstract. Conflict lacks tangible opposition; no character resists Elara’s song, and the “fragmented dialects” pose no actual barrier. The tightening is textual (song → chorus) not causal, fitting an Accumulative lens, but the absence of resistance or cost undermines escalation. Mr. Kovar’s story offers emotional payoff but no consequential trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting abandoned human dreams—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s personal entanglement. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses modification over repair, accepting mental risk (“could unravel her mind”). Yet the escalation lacks visible price: no stamina loss, tool failure, or emotional rupture alters tactics. The “quaking reverie” stilled at the end implies internal cost, but it’s abstract. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though protagonist agency in the climax is muted (the mirror “shimmered”—passive voice).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking forgotten combinations for vigilance—is signaled early and tightens at the inversion threshold. Agency is present: Elara aligns the doodle, whispers the combination. But escalation leans on external mechanics (gravity inversion) rather than deepening internal or tactical struggle. Cost is declared (“responsibility”) but not shown as a trade-off; nothing is lost or sacrificed beyond effort. Luck (annual event) complicates but doesn’t resolve—yet pressure peaks feel preordained, not earned through adversity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s interaction with the insulator, which amplifies her work. The tightening occurs when the insulator’s “quiet energy” intensifies her focus, narrowing her world to wood and porcelain. Agency is maintained through deliberate strikes, each a “note” in her symphony. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and temporal sacrifice (night-long labor), though the absence of tangible risk or loss limits escalation to thematic resonance rather than visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redefining silence as bridge, not cage—is signaled early and deepens through the chess ritual. The tightening occurs when pieces move “as if guided,” forcing Alara to interpret sacrifice as progress. Agency is present (she chooses the new pattern, topples the king), and cost is conceptual (abandoning hope of restoring the old covenant). Yet escalation relies on mystical intervention (nexus pulse) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; coincidence complicates but also resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost stories to understand empathy—is signaled early and deepens thematically, but pressure remains static. No real opposition exists; the locked clasp yields effortlessly to Elara’s “frequency tuning,” removing tension. The tightening is textual, not tactical: fireworks approach, but time doesn’t alter choices. Cost is conceptual (silence as legacy) but never felt as loss, trade-off, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s longing for meaning beyond ambition—is signaled early and deepens through her care for the corpse flower. The turning of the tide’s thought creates a window of heightened perception that escalates internal pressure. Yet the conflict remains internal and abstract; no external or interpersonal opposition tests her commitment. The cost (a lighter heart, new clarity) is felt but not visibly paid—no opportunity is lost, no relationship altered, no practice abandoned. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices for mid-high band, but lacks the tactical consequence needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens when echoes begin fading. The gravity inversion adds temporal pressure, but its clock isn’t leveraged tactically; Elara acts calmly within it. Agency is present (she inserts the arrow), yet escalation relies more on discovery than compounding obstacles. Cost is felt conceptually (planet’s weakening core) but not viscerally borne by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing future disasters through foresight—is signaled early and deepens at the wreckage when Elara realizes prediction was possible. Pressure tightens once: the aircraft’s presence transforms survey into revelation. But escalation relies on deduction, not agency; Elara observes, doesn’t intervene. Cost is conceptual (the town’s silence), not tactical or personal, weakening pressure under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and deepens through the urgency of the sculptor’s chisel moment. Pressure escalates via temporal precision and emotional weight, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of silence. However, the external conflict is minimal; escalation relies on internal and atmospheric pressure rather than oppositional force. Cost is felt conceptually (lifelong mission fulfilled) but lacks concrete forfeiture or irreversible loss beyond abstract “unfettering.”

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding interworld power without causing destruction—is signaled early and tightens when Elara hesitates before playing the flute. The meaningful deepening occurs in that hesitation, where fear of repeating failure clashes with desire for truth. Yet the escalation lacks visible price: no stamina loss, tool damage, or opportunity cost alters her tactics. The stakes feel viscerally personal but remain internalized without external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering emotion’s “mathematics” to mend human fractures—is signaled early and tightens when transposed empathy overwhelms Elias, forcing him to confront chaos within. The deepening occurs at the climax: connection isn’t erasure but expansion, a trade-off with cost (identity destabilization). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of borrowed voices, pulsing light, fading stars—and culminates in a stance crystallization. No false resolution; the cost (psychic turmoil) is palpable and shapes the ending’s poise.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—delivering a relic while navigating grief and uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant reveals its attunement to Elara. The tightening occurs at the cottage: the scholar’s claim that the relic chose her reframes the entire mission, raising emotional stakes. Agency is present in Elara’s lingering touch and eventual acceptance. Cost is felt (loss of mentor’s certainty), but the escalation leans on revelation over active choice, slightly softening pressure under a strict Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the prism’s embedded grief, forcing her to shift from theory to witness. The tightening occurs at the resonance moment, foreclosing detached observation. Cost is felt in her trembling and altered worldview, though no tangible loss (time, tool, relationship) grounds it. Escalation is driven by her agency (hovering hands, picking up prism), not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara leaves home, foreclosing safety. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to follow the puzzle, encounters phenomena, and places the final piece. Cost is felt (“latent sacrifice,” “weight of her sacrifice”) and legible in the ending. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (puzzle as map) suffices, though external pressure remains abstract rather than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the planet at personal cost—is signaled early and tightens when Eli chooses to descend the treacherous mines. His agency drives every escalation, and the trade (“your awakening”) imposes a conceptual price that crystallizes in the ending. Yet the mine shafts’ danger is asserted more than dramatized; Eli faces no near-collapse or tactical adaptation, softening the pressure. Still, the cost is unmistakable: his stable selfhood is irrevocably altered, charging the final image with quiet poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering a personal truth—is signaled early, but escalation is expository, not active. Elara doesn’t *do* anything to earn the blue shard; it’s handed to her. The “heavier than you imagine” warning promises cost, yet none materializes—no trade-off, loss, or foreclosed path. Coincidence (the shard’s spontaneous appearance) enables resolution rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting the light as symbolic and literal safety—is signaled early and deepens through the sea glass message and stones. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he interprets, rearranges, and acts. Yet the threat remains entirely abstract; no external pressure or consequence tests his choice. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence, burden of knowledge) but not viscerally dramatized. Coincidence (finding glass, hidden compartment) complicates but borders on resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost beings home via the beam—is signaled early and deepens when the beam veers autonomously, forcing the Herald to choose between panic and curiosity. The meaningful tightening occurs when they actively steer into the fog, accepting risk to fulfill their unknowable purpose. Cost is felt conceptually: their ordinary routine is revealed as cosmic duty, foreclosing solitude. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the fog’s sentience slightly edges into convenient mystery rather than earned opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to carry or release painful stories—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s encounter. The tightening occurs when the widow confesses her husband’s death, forcing Kael to articulate his philosophy. Cost is felt (her vulnerability, his burden) but not viscerally paid; no tool lost, time spent, or relationship altered. Agency lies in attention and dialogue, valid under Accumulative lens, yet the pressure remains cerebral, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming sorrow through witnessing—is signaled early and deepens via dream fragments that escalate emotional density. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his choice to deconstruct the sextant triggers coalescence of scattered dreams. Cost is felt in the “accumulation of lives” he shoulders, though it remains conceptual rather than physical or social. The lens (Accumulative) holds: pressure builds through layered memory, not external opposition, culminating in Charged Poise where options (to ignore or engage sorrow) are crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the realm through forgotten songs—is signaled early and deepens as each recovered thread warms the mirror world. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara confronts her own scattered nature as the obstacle to the final thread, forcing inward focus over external search. Cost is felt: the communities’ solitude and her own memory loss are palpable burdens. Yet the resolution leans on intuitive recall rather than hard-won discovery, slightly softening the escalation’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—embracing paradox as strength—is signaled early and deepens via archival research. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise: Elara steps into the world newly armed with perspective. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven turns; discovery is passive (books “hold a piece,” Thaddeus explains), and no tangible price is paid—only internal reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring meaning in ruin—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s actions, fitting the Accumulative lens. Her guerrilla gardening represents agency via attention and endurance, not confrontation. However, the cost remains abstract: no tool is lost, no time forfeited, no social consequence incurred. The “tenuous absolution” is felt but not priced; the story implies sacrifice without dramatizing a trade-off that alters tactics. Still, the lavender planting after the plaque find shows a meaningful tightening of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when the anomalous slide reveals the library as a conduit. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to step into the projection triggers the transformation, forcing renunciation of passive order for urgent connection. Cost is felt: her orderly world trembles, and she accepts ongoing labor (“work was far from over”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the “tightening” is thematic rather than tactical—no lost tool or time—but still sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens when Lila confronts the necklace-wearer. Her agency drives the climax: she rewrites rules through rhetoric, not force. But pressure plateaus; the men’s unease reads as narrative fiat, not earned resistance. Cost is felt conceptually (“trust… never fully repaired”), yet no tangible loss (time, tool, ally) alters her tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her luminous nature and the weather-carriers—is signaled early and deepens when the ring identifies danger/opportunity. The tightening occurs when the figure reveals Elara’s election, raising personal stakes. However, escalation relies on revelation, not protagonist-driven agency; Elara reacts rather than acts. Cost is felt emotionally (loss of skepticism) but not viscerally demonstrated—no tool lost, time spent, or relationship altered. The forests’ election remains a backdrop, not a live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creative authenticity vs. safe repetition—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts her forgotten self-portrait, foreclosing her old path. Agency is clear: she chooses to paint her true self, not another commission. The escalation hinges on protagonist-driven discovery, not luck, and the cost (a decade of stifled potential) charges the final image. Yet the “inescapable calling” remains abstract; its pressure lacks tangible consequences beyond internal unease, slightly softening the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth to revive Verdania—is signaled early and tightens when Elara learns the oasis was sacrificed deliberately. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to transcribe painful truths despite her script’s wilting. The cost—facing systemic betrayal—is felt in her trembling hands and the narrative’s emotional weight. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though the stakes could feel more viscerally immediate during the chamber scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens texturally via the iceberg’s intensifying glow. Yet pressure remains static; no reversal or meaningful narrowing occurs. Elara faces no obstacle, only process. The climax arises from completion, not conflict. Cost is implied (fleetingness) but not paid through agency—luck or ritual, not choice, drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the farm against internal chaos—is signaled early and tightens when fears manifest. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to open the box and initiates miniaturization. Cost is legible (memory loss) and scales to length. Yet pressure relies heavily on internal sensation (“static,” “dissonance”) without external complication; the magnetic shift adds texture but no tactical constraint. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but the conflict remains largely solitary, limiting friction depth expected at elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden stories—is signaled early and deepens into emotional healing. Pressure escalates via the locket’s warmth and Mrs. Ellis’s revelation, narrowing Clara’s path to action. But agency is passive: she’s told she’s “worthy,” then finds a key conveniently hidden in the locket. The cost is emotional (confronting loss/forgiveness) but not dramatized as a trade-off—no option is foreclosed, only accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—liberating buried knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals its dance-based cipher. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the anomaly “appears,” the pedestal “rests,” and the walls “shift” in response to Elara’s dance without resistance or trade-off. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent; the conflict resolves through attunement, not pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, this works partially, but cost isn’t legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is signaled early and deepens through Eli’s ritual. The escalation hinges on his agency: reciting patterns triggers the gravity shift, a credible intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt conceptually (years of searching, fragility of hope) but not viscerally paid in the moment—no tool broken, no time lost, no physical toll. Still, the stakes remain coherent and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—containing the prophecy—is signaled early and tightens once: the coded words “thrash like a trapped animal,” forcing Elara’s “final surge.” Agency is present (her will seals the void), and cost is conceptual (eternal watchfulness). But escalation lacks tangible trade-offs; no stamina, time, or tool degradation alters her approach. The “tranquil blaze” stakes feel atmospheric, not viscerally tested—chaos remains abstract, never threatening a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering silenced histories through relational listening—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reframes the seal as a key. The tightening occurs when Clara accepts the sugar pouch, foreclosing continued isolation. Escalation is driven by Clara’s curiosity-turned-commitment under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost (emotional vulnerability, confronting neglect) is felt but could be more viscerally rendered in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating isolated memories into resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Elara accepts archivist duty. Pressure escalates via the shell’s hum and flood of foreign emotions, narrowing her options to resistance or integration. Her choice to stop resisting carries cost: loss of skepticism, absorption of others’ pain. Agency drives escalation; coincidence doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts her father’s letter. The tightening occurs at the thorn’s touch: she must choose between preserving pain or risking emptiness. Cost is visible in the “weight lift[ing] from her chest” and the irreversible blankness of the scroll. Agency drives escalation—her micro-choice to whisper the mantra initiates the dissolution. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some people echo—is signaled early and deepens through the pool vision, which reweights the premise from personal mystery to cosmic design. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through narrowing options; Elara faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off. The figure’s challenge (“ensure you are ready”) lacks teeth, and the “cost” of clarity is purely emotional (melancholy lifting), not consequential. Agency is passive: she receives truth rather than wrests it through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early and tightens through each dream shard, narrowing Elara’s focus to one family’s tragedy. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to interpret, record, and finally speak the names. The cost is felt in emotional labor and implied lifelong burden, though not dramatized as a tangible forfeiture. Coincidence (dreamers’ unrelated locations) complicates but doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through her method, satisfying lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s meditation, but there’s no meaningful escalation or pressure that forces a trade-off. The “conflict” is entirely internal and static; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. While thematically coherent, the absence of tangible stakes or agency-driven turning points limits tension under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens when Elara learns the stillpoint is a prison. Her agency drives escalation: reassembling letters, pressing the diamond, chanting. The deepening (stillpoint feeds on life) credibly narrows options. Cost is visible: she stabilizes the threat but loses the orchard’s protective bubble. However, the “ancient danger” remains abstract, slightly weakening the visceral weight of the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—choosing between upholding or unfolding world order—is signaled early and tightens at the climax. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers messages, approaches the portico, and activates it. Cost is visible (lost connections, sanity) but remains abstract; the “variant allegiance” isn’t dramatized as a tangible trade-off, weakening the moral calculus under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—redeeming lost voices through sound—is signaled early and tightens when the music box resists, forcing Elias into vulnerability (“Speak to me”). The escalation peaks not through external opposition but internal pressure: his willingness to risk silence, then accept shattering glass without flinching. Cost is visible—the broken jar—and conceptual: he trades control for surrender, enabling the box’s autonomy. While the protagonist’s agency drives the turn, the resolution leans on the object’s sudden cooperation, which borders on convenient unless read as earned through his prior humility.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (protecting the key to preserve balance) is signaled early and tightens when the figure appears. The deepening—revealing the world’s disharmony—tests Elara’s conviction, but the reversal (figure’s true intent) arrives via visual spectacle rather than protagonist-driven discovery. Cost is implied (ongoing vigilance) but not felt; no stamina, tool, or opportunity is lost during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—sculpting patience from impatience—is signaled early but never tested through escalating pressure. Elara’s “work” involves observation and meditation, not decisions with consequences. The arrival of visitors introduces social pressure, but their transformation is summarized, not dramatized, and no option is foreclosed with cost. Under an Accumulative lens, a single deepening suffices, but here the “tightening” is thematic repetition, not narrative intensification that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional corruption—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the photo reveal, which forecloses loyalty to her mentor. Pressure escalates via protagonist-driven empirical observation, though the “web of corruption” remains vague. Cost is conceptual (loss of trust, professional risk) but not viscerally dramatized; no tangible sacrifice (time, tool, safety) alters tactics. Coincidence is avoided, but stakes stay intellectual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Thomas’s innocence and Elias’s complicity—is signaled early and deepens when Alistair links mending to truth. The tightening occurs when Elias realizes repair demands action, not just belief. Cost is felt in lost time and moral burden; agency crystallizes in his silent departure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—pressure stems entirely from character choices under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking humanity’s unspoken yearning—is signaled early and deepens when the algorithm stabilizes into the bell. Lira’s agency drives escalation: feeding images, adjusting code, ringing the bell. Cost is legible in her bloodshot eyes and calloused hands, though not sharply consequential. The bell’s resonance awakens the world, reweighting the stake from personal obsession to cosmic signal—but no path is foreclosed, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—solving the Echo-7 disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara lies to continue offline, foreclosing safe compliance. The recurring numbers deepen the mystery and narrow her focus, culminating in coordinates that reweight the mission’s fate. Cost is felt: she risks her job and safety. Escalation is driven by her agency, though the system’s “Access denied” momentarily leans on external obstruction rather than her choices alone.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—mending fractured souls through empathy—is signaled early and deepens via mirror visions. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally: each glimpse adds meaning but doesn’t raise personal risk or narrow tactical options. Elara faces no opposition, loss, or trade-off; the “cost” is implied but never dramatized (e.g., no stamina drain, time pressure, or emotional toll from confronting her fears). The climax resolves through convergence, not agency—fragments float together by “unseen force,” undercutting earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the “sound of approaching endings”—is clear early and deepens through survivor encounters, especially the man’s whispered question. Yet escalation relies on passive immersion, not protagonist-driven agency; Elara doesn’t trawl or volunteer actively, merely receives wisdom. The cost (emotional recalibration) is felt but not forged through resistance or sacrifice, softening the pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling love’s mismatch—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s meditation, but pressure remains internal and untested by external opposition. The burned letter and empty station frame a situational constraint (isolation), yet no meaningful tightening occurs; her “rediscovery” is contemplative, not consequential. Cost is implied (lost love, solitude) but not dramatized through trade-offs or renunciation that alter behavior. Agency resides in attention, but the lack of active conflict limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving echo of wisdom—is signaled early and deepens via ritual. But pressure remains static: no opposition, complication, or tactical shift arises. The “prophet’s imminent arrival” tightens time, yet Elara faces no obstacle, dilemma, or consequence beyond internal solemnity. Cost is implied (change is coming) but never felt in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into healing—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s arrangement of photographs. The tightening occurs subtly: as dusk falls, the ruins shift from symbols of loss to “living monument,” reweighting her mission. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; no obstacle challenges her method, and the “hum” of the field remains atmospheric, not adversarial. Cost is conceptual (emotional labor), but not dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost language—is signaled early and deepens as the crystal’s echoes reveal a “blueprint of growth.” The meaningful intensification occurs when Elias realizes decoding will exhaust the crystal, forcing a trade-off: knowledge for the object’s life. Cost is felt (“triumph and sorrow”) and visible in his trembling hand. Agency drives escalation: his humming provokes responses, shaping the discovery. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his method earns the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing aging’s sound—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from passive echo-clinging to active sound-hunting. The tightening occurs at the pond: his chalk-dip transforms markers into a circle, foreclosing linear searching. Cost is felt in his relinquished tools and the irreversible acceptance of ephemeral sound over tangible proof. Protagonist agency drives escalation, though the fog’s thickening briefly flirts with coincidental complication.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (“harness the ephemeral”) is signaled early and deepens when the spinning hand becomes “time itself spiraling.” The tightening occurs when Elara shifts from repair to reimagination—a renunciation of control that forecloses fixing time. Escalation is driven by her agency (dismantling the clock), not coincidence. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of stillness, though the price lacks tangible consequence (no lost tool, stamina, or irreversible trade-off).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is clear early and tightens when Elara initiates contact with Claire, narrowing options from passive accompaniment to active intervention. Cost is felt (emotional labor, confronting estrangement) but not deeply dramatized; the resolution leans on coincidence (Claire arrives within hours) without showing resistance or negotiation. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, though agency could be more contested.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—solving where shadows go—is signaled early and resolved, but escalation lacks tangible pressure. The “sealed awakening” is treated as atmospheric backdrop rather than an active threat; the isle drifting lower creates mood, not meaningful constraint. Elara’s agency is intact (she chooses to relearn, to wait at noon), yet no real risk or opposition tests her—luck or coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does genuine resistance. Cost is conceptual (lost mentor, solitude) but not dramatized as altering tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turning mistakes into constellations—is signaled early and deepens when Elara sacrifices her stone of certainty. Pressure escalates coherently under a Causal lens: tooth enables entry, fountain demands price, choice forecloses old self. But the “substitute body” backstory introduces external stakes that aren’t tested in-scene; the real conflict is internal, making the village’s fate feel ornamental. Cost is felt (loss of control) but not viscerally dramatized during the offering.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—sharing non-consuming light—is signaled early and deepens through the polishing act, which narrows her path from memory to creation. Pressure accumulates texturally: mist thickens, memories intensify, glass glows. The escalation is protagonist-driven (her hands, breath, focus), not coincidental. Cost is felt in her irreversible step from sanctuary to village—a quiet but definitive trade of safety for purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding protected space for vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens when Kai arrives, testing Elara’s refuge. Her choice to let him in constitutes a meaningful tightening: she risks re-exposure for connection. Cost is felt (her instinctive shielding via the pendant), though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than high-pressure conflict. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices as a resonant deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—collecting and solemnizing ephemeral hopes—is signaled early and escalates via accumulating cameos. Elara’s agency drives progression (choosing to follow the path, accepting each story), but pressure remains abstract; the nexus poses no active opposition, only passive haunting. Cost is emotional but not dramatized as a foreclosed path—e.g., she doesn’t reject personal ambition to serve these voices, muting the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring healing songs—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes alignment is fleeting (“timeframe was crucial”). Her humming initiates escalation, and the vine’s response narrows her path to song-as-remedy. Cost is conceptual: the burden of teaching her village, implied in “work was far from over.” However, the conflict lacks external pressure or tangible loss; success arrives through attunement, not sacrifice, softening the felt price required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—translating heartbeats into emotional maps—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains static, not escalating. Elara faces no real obstacle; the ritual proceeds unimpeded, with success guaranteed by patience alone. The “tremor” introduces mild tension but resolves without cost or trade-off. Agency is performative rather than consequential: her actions demonstrate devotion but don’t foreclose alternatives or extract visible price, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s meticulous labor. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: days blur, dreams fill with angles, twilight offers revelation. The tightening occurs when dusk alignment clicks, narrowing options to one solution. Cost is visible (exhaustion, isolation), but the “wounded season” clock doesn’t force urgency—time feels suspended, not scarce. Protagonist agency drives the turn, yet stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—carrying others’ burdens at the cost of self—is signaled early and tightens when the figure questions Elara’s own load, forcing a trade-off: continue self-effacement or reclaim agency. The deepening occurs via Elara’s realization that understanding must begin with herself, narrowing her prior infinite scope to a personal fractal map. Cost is felt in the “fissure” within her soul and the implicit loss of purity in her original purpose. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harvesting meaning from loss—is signaled early and deepens via the carving process. The “here and gone” philosophy tightens options: Elara chooses creation over paralysis. Agency is clear in micro-choices (sipping tea to ground herself, tackling the mane). Cost is felt emotionally but not materially dramatized beyond interiority; no tangible forfeiture beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with eroded ambitions—is signaled early and deepens when the camera wheel delivers Mara’s own voice, forcing a reinterpretation of her ghost. Agency is clear: she chooses to follow the wheel’s hum, foreclosing passive despair. The tightening occurs at the voice-loop beat, narrowing her path to active reconstruction. Cost is felt but not visibly paid beyond emotional weight; a concrete forfeiture (e.g., abandoning safety) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting meaning from ruin—is signaled early and deepens when Eli shifts from assessment to active intervention. The tightening occurs when he chooses to manipulate the terminal’s systems, narrowing his role from observer to co-creator. Cost is conceptual (investing labor in a futile gesture) and felt in the stoic dawn departure. However, pressure remains internal and untested by external opposition, limiting escalation under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices, but stakes never risk tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reconciling abandoned dream with duty) is signaled early and deepens when the crystals whisper “bear,” forcing Elara to confront buried longing. The tightening is protagonist-driven: she chooses to finish her father’s clock, altering her relationship to time itself. Cost is unmistakable—the “void” of the blank clock face mirrors her emptiness, and completing it requires enduring that pain. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure crescendos via sensory density (rain scent, humming stones) culminating in the sanctuary’s “held breath,” making her choice feel inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth beneath deception—is signaled early and deepens when the captain’s confession reveals personal cost. Elara’s agency drives the turn: she chooses to salvage, reads the journal, and interprets the sundial’s glow. Yet the escalation lacks tangible pressure; no opposition, time crunch, or physical/emotional risk raises the cost. The “serene upheaval” remains tonal, not tactical—luck or ease resolves the search, undercutting earned tension. A single meaningful tightening occurs, but without visible price altering later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the rope reveals itself as a map. Pressure escalates through cognitive intensity, not external threat, fitting the Accumulative lens. Elara’s agency lies in sustained attention; her “coaxing” yields revelation, but the cost is subtle: years of isolation, the burden of being the sole listener. While stakes feel viscerally urgent to her, the lack of tangible consequence beyond personal fulfillment slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—grieving a living absence—is signaled early and deepens when the traveler writes an obituary not for the husband but for the waiting self. This act narrows options: the woman must confront her endurance as a form of loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the single tightening (writing/reading the obituary) forces emotional reckoning. Cost is visible: silent tears, relinquishing the ritual of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Kael confronts the machine’s presence, forcing him to question his methods. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to assemble the fragments despite betrayal. The cost is legible in his dread and the realization that progress demanded sacrifice. Under a Causal lens, this tightening forecloses the fantasy of easy restoration, charging the final image with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“transform damage into beauty”) tightens through Elara’s grafting—a single, meaningful deepening that narrows options to this fragile act. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: clouds migrate, wind carries rain-scent, villagers’ whispers loom off-page. Cost is felt (years of battling fires, hardened heart) but not dramatized in active opposition; escalation relies on internal resolve rather than external complication. Still, the stakes are viscerally rendered and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens via breadcrumb discoveries that narrow options (e.g., the fountain inscription demands action). Elara’s agency drives escalation: each shard retrieval tests her skepticism. Cost is legible—the emotional toll of confronting her younger self—and the city’s revival hinges on her persistence. Coincidence (the box’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax stems from her decisive placement of the mirror shard.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (“share light without fire”) is signaled early but never tested by concrete opposition—there is no antagonist, obstacle, or failed attempt. Escalation occurs texturally (brightening blooms, intensifying gear-glow) but not causally; Elara’s “sonar pinging” yields success without resistance. The absence of meaningful pressure or tactical adaptation prevents stakes from feeling urgent. Cost is implied (“weight of purpose”) but never manifested as a foreclosed path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—carving the uncarvable essence of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes grief as movement, not form. The tightening occurs when she abandons literal representation for symbolic weaving, narrowing her approach to one that honors process over permanence. Cost is felt in her surrender of definitive answers, though the pressure remains internal and meditative rather than externally tested. Agency is present but low-intensity, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reinterprets his role. The tightening occurs during the pendulum’s pause, where he shifts from mechanic to moral agent. Cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid duty for uncertain human connection) and felt in his solitude-to-community arc. Yet pressure remains abstract; no concrete obstacle opposes him, and the townsfolk’s healing arrives via convenient vignettes without resistance. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but lacks the visceral friction that would elevate stakes beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to recover lost intentions—is signaled early and deepens through sustained focus. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias shifts from observation to active decoding, committing hours until the clock runs down. Cost is conceptual (time, solitude) but not viscerally felt; no trade-off forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation via density suffices, but the absence of a concrete forfeiture limits pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation in a fear-frozen world—is signaled early and deepens when Ignorance abandons predictive models for intuitive writing. This tightening forecloses reliance on logic, forcing vulnerability. Yet escalation leans on magical quill rather than protagonist agency; the “distant laughter” and sudden forest feel coincidental, not earned by his struggle. Cost remains abstract (“doubters ahead”) rather than immediate or visceral at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (“resurrect lost narratives”) is signaled early and tightens when the pirate broadcast arrives—a live option emerges. Agency is shown through frantic transcription and tactile engagement with the radio. Cost is felt in the abrupt silence post-broadcast and the unanswered “how? by whom?” gnawing at her. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (the song’s responsive tempo) suffices, though the stakes remain slightly abstract rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring the dead through ephemeral art—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the mask’s fragility. The single tightening occurs as the chair stops, forcing her to act before stillness becomes final. Cost is felt in her emotional burden and the irreversible scattering. Agency is present but muted; she endures rather than decides, which fits Earned Stasis but slightly softens escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge vs. adapting to survival—is signaled early and deepens when Lira challenges Kael’s narrative. The collapse raises pressure credibly, forcing a trade-off between hoarding relics and risking loss for potential collaboration. However, escalation relies partly on coincidence (Lira’s timely news), and Kael’s agency in the climax is reactive rather than decisive; he follows, doesn’t choose. Cost is conceptual (risk of losing artifacts) but not viscerally felt in the moment, softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through choral unity—is signaled early and deepens via the “subtract noise” ritual. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: hums intertwine, audience appears, library “pulses.” But escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; change arrives via ambient transformation, not a costly choice that forecloses alternatives. The “traveled stillness” trait never forces a trade-off—resignation evaporates without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving care in a careless world—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts her fear that her rebellion is “too gentle.” The celestial alignment creates a live clock, forcing immediate action, and her pruning of the greenhouse embodies agency that narrows options (choosing restoration over passive waiting). Cost is felt: hours of solitary labor, emotional vulnerability. Yet the escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than concrete opposition—no external force challenges her, making the conflict feel internalized to the point of abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses descent over safety. The deepening occurs at the orb, where knowledge forecloses ignorance as an option. Cost is felt (isolation, burden of truth) but not visibly paid in action; the tower humming back to life risks undercutting sacrifice by implying easy restoration. Still, pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when the shard reveals displaced objects as vessels of memory. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he collects, arranges, and sanctifies, transforming passive noticing into active ritual. Cost is conceptual (he now bears witness to hidden narratives), though not viscerally felt; the tightening is tonal and thematic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—saving lives via a fragile cure—is signaled early and tightens when Liora reveals the ampoule’s structural weakness, forcing Elara to confront her blind spot. Agency lies in Liora’s choice to intervene and Elara’s subsequent decision to retest, both driven by kindness and doubt. Cost is felt in Elara’s lost certainty and the implied risk of delay. Escalation is clean under a Causal lens, though the “cascading revelations” remain abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightens when the chipped die tumbles irretrievably, forcing renunciation. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s roll of the remaining die is an active choice that deepens thematic pressure. Cost is legible (“weight… now light”) but slightly abstract; a more tactile consequence would heighten stakes. Coincidence never resolves—pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost kindness through art—is signaled early and tightens when the brush “urges her to begin,” transforming painting from solace to duty. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to dip the brush, then paint furiously, altering her relationship to the past. Cost is conceptual (carrying the weight of a forgotten city’s language) and felt in the “strange calm” that replaces exhaustion. However, the pressure lacks a concrete trade-off—no time, tool, or social credit is visibly forfeited—which prevents full 8.8+ eligibility under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving dying traditions—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara risks emotional exposure by baking for strangers. The deepening occurs when the lens chimes in approval, transforming private ritual into communal catalyst. Cost is felt: years of isolation, fear of irrelevance, and the vulnerability of offering something fragile to indifferent neighbors. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (baking, displaying bread), not coincidence—the beekeeper’s honey complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rewriting destiny—is signaled early and tightens when the stone glows and the island resists, raising cost. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his dismantling of the yoyo initiates the climax. The turn forecloses return (“no going back”) with conceptual cost—unpredictable consequences of bending time. However, the island’s “resistance” borders on coincidental personification rather than earned environmental pressure, slightly softening the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting the fear of being forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through paradoxical notes and shifting reflections. Clara’s agency peaks when she “unbosoms” her terror, triggering the climax. However, escalation relies heavily on the advisor’s exposition (“Fear hides its weakness…”) rather than Clara’s independent discovery, weakening pressure coherence. The cost—emotional liberation—is felt but not visibly paid beyond atmospheric shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming chaos into harmony—is signaled early and tightens through Leeward’s deliberate note-striking, which narrows interpretive options. Agency drives escalation: each mallet strike deepens understanding and reshapes the clouds. However, the “dissonance” lacks tangible consequence beyond mood; the cost remains abstract, preventing full high-band entry despite strong thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving Valtara by restoring balance—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the turtles are dying. The tightening occurs at the chamber: knowledge replaces hope with urgent duty. Cost is legible (“time is running out”) and shapes her next journey. However, the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active trade-off; she gains insight but forfeits nothing tangible in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the humanity behind deception. Pressure escalates via textual clues (ledger, letter) under an Accumulative lens, though the “challenge” feels low-risk; no real opposition or consequence threatens failure. The tightening occurs in her conceptual stance, not external options, which fits the lens but lacks visceral cost. Agency is intellectual, not physical, limiting felt escalation despite thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten dreams—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals the community’s belief that dreams “carry creators away.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: his repair work and note-writing actively contest that vanishing. Cost is visible (raw hands, soaked clothes) and conceptual (bearing witness to interlaced absence). Coincidence (finding the journal) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his labor earns the mosaic’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering buried truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts from cataloging to decoding spatial anomalies. Yet escalation relies on discovery rather than active pressure: books are “out of place,” ink “doesn’t match,” but no opposing force or consequence tests her resolve. The blackout functions as atmospheric catalyst, not a live clock altering tactics. Final cost is conceptual (truth revealed) but lacks tangible forfeiture—no tool lost, time exhausted, or path closed—limiting stakes’ visceral grip.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into light—is signaled early and deepens when Lira challenges its premise. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael chooses to enter the basilica, narrowing his options from crafting escape to confronting truth. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each folded crane, each avoided glance at the lantern, tightens the emotional coil. Cost is felt in the “luminous torment” and the abandoned masterpiece—visible prices that charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding unused potential—is signaled early and deepens through Zara’s study of crystals, culminating in her realization that resilience lies within. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each observation tightens her focus, though escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options. The cost is conceptual (abandoning passive grief for active seeking) and felt in the “bleak exhilaration” of irreversible change. However, the “hunt” remains abstract; no tangible trade-off (time, safety, tool) alters tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (“decode frequency of belonging”) is signaled early but remains emotionally abstract, never tested by concrete loss or trade-off. Each piece is found via drone-assisted convenience, not protagonist-driven risk—agency is passive reconnaissance, not decisive action. Pressure accumulates linearly without deepening; the “star trails” method introduces no tactical complication. Cost is implied thematically but never felt in narrowed options or sacrificed resources.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—moral integrity vs. professional complicity—is signaled early and tightens when the buried memory resurfaces, foreclosing further deception. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his descent, sifting, and alignment of the watch hand narrow options until only renunciation remains. Cost is unmistakable in the physical collapse (“gasping for air”) and symbolic surrender (watch sinking). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via textural intensification, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—untethering nations from mistrust—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s proposal to “recycle mistakes into wisdom.” The tightening occurs when Kael challenges neutrality as “luxury,” forcing Elara to redefine it as “presence of understanding.” Cost is felt: both must relinquish moral superiority. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the reversal lacks visceral consequence—no tangible loss, only rhetorical concession.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming navigational agency—is signaled early and deepens when Mara abandons celestial tools for terrestrial poles. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses adaptation over perfection, narrowing her options to human-scale markers. Cost is felt in her physical fragility and emotional weight, though the escalation lacks a concrete trade-off (e.g., sacrificing safety for insight). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with regret as a persistent undertow rather than a resolved obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming empathy through understanding rather than erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses immersion over retreat. The meaningful deepening occurs underwater, where he realizes the labyrinth is internal. Cost is legible: he forfeits the baseball (his map) and accepts that the past cannot be undone. Agency drives escalation, though the time traveler’s role remains coincidental rather than pressurizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens into self-reconciliation. The tightening occurs when the guardian reframes the quest, forcing Elara to choose between memory and metamorphosis. Cost is felt (letting go of the past), but escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than protagonist-driven pressure. The conjuring act is reactive to the guardian’s prompt rather than arising from a series of escalating tactical choices under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the saucer’s crack reveals floating fireflies of missed moments. Elara’s agency drives escalation: drawing cards, unfastening her cloak, pressing her palm to the saucer—all narrow options toward presence. Cost is unmistakable: the stone-like weight of absence, crystallized in her nephew’s untouched hand. Coincidence (clouds guiding her) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her willing engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (humanity’s survival via compassion) is signaled early, but pressure remains abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. “Shadow work” deepens thematically but doesn’t alter tactics; stitching air resolves conflict through metaphor, not causality. Happiness-induced gravity shifts complicate nothing and exact no price, violating lens coherence for Accumulative design requiring felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—grasping transformation through surrender—is signaled early and deepens when the detour replaces the planned pilgrimage. The tightening occurs at the archway, where Elara must choose between keeping the bottle or releasing it; this forecloses her old symbolic relationship with change. Cost is visible: she relinquishes her “most cherished possession.” But escalation relies on external mysticism (“whispering hush”) rather than protagonist-driven agency, weakening causal ownership of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—awakening the oppressed without bloodshed—is signaled early and deepens when Thorne appears as ideological opposition. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to act despite risk, foreclosing covert safety. The cost is conceptual (exposure, potential arrest) but legible in Thorne’s narrowed eyes and her retreat into shadows. However, the blackout’s resolution via the cradle borders on convenient if not for its thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns—is signaled early and deepens when the sequence becomes a “key.” Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to scatter the dust, triggering the climax. Cost is legible: years of torment, trading his “most prized eel,” and enduring near-madness. However, the resolution leans on mystical causality (aurora surging, eels leaping) that borders on coincidence; tighter linkage between his actions and cosmic response would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—confronting one’s mapped scars—is signaled early and deepens when the envelope reveals a body-map tied to memory and betrayal. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara breaks the seal, foreclosing continued avoidance. Agency is internal but decisive: choosing to write uncensored constitutes renunciation of protective silence. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability) and conceptual (reclaiming authorship of pain), though external pressure remains abstract—no live antagonist or tangible consequence beyond self-reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the overture’s truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from seeking location to process. His agency drives escalation: each verbal parry narrows interpretive options until Mara’s hesitation creates opening for his insight. Cost is conceptual (abandoning certainty) but legible in the arm’s stillness and shared silence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and sustained, with the library’s restoration as its vessel. Pressure accumulates texturally through shared labor and discovered letters, but no meaningful tightening occurs: no setback, resource loss, or opposition forces a trade-off. The conflict remains abstract; external chaos is declared but never concretely impedes their work. Cost is implied (“wounds healing”) but not dramatized as a price paid that alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elara risks hope via the film reel. The meaningful tightening occurs when she steps into the reel, trading passive refuge for active immersion, with visible cost: confronting painful memories. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens; coincidence (the reel’s existence) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Final cost is conceptual: she surrenders the fantasy of rewriting fate for the harder truth of composing anew.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory before monsoon—is signaled early and tightens via fraying rituals. The creature’s challenge deepens pressure by testing Elara’s understanding of memory’s dual nature. Agency is present (her answer unlocks the seed), and cost (carrying darkness with light) is acknowledged. Yet escalation relies on a single test; earlier signs of decay aren’t woven into active obstacles, softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving regret over unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens when Elias discovers the unsent letters. His agency drives escalation: he follows the compass, deciphers the lace, reads aloud. The cost is felt in relinquishment (leaving relics behind) and emotional exposure (giving voice to others’ pain). Coincidence is minimal; pressure coheres under accumulative design, though the lace’s “instructions” verge on convenient magic without clearer mechanics.
