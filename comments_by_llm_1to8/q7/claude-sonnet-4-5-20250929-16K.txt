  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character (scarred hands), investigation (ledger gaps), or atmosphere (frost retreat). Rhythm varies—short declaratives at the reveal ("She was simply geography"), longer accumulative sentences during the frost passage. Minor loop: "steadily adaptive" appears in paragraph one and late-story interiority without functional change. The metaphor strand (glass/light/frost) is coherent and pays off, though "silver shadows" is near-cliché. No major artifacts. The final sentence risks overwriting with three similes stacked ("like breath, like the hum of cooling glass, like everything that continues"), but the parallelism reads purposeful (lyric closure) rather than muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Unshaken Marvels" names the project and introduces theme in one beat). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, several phrases edge toward stock lyricism: "frozen cathedral," "invisible symphonies," "topographical map of heat signatures" are vivid but slightly familiar. The capsizing summary in paragraph two uses passive nominalizations ("the sudden pressure change rupturing something irreparable") where active syntax would sharpen. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph lands without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance both atmosphere and plot (the kelp-wrapped package, the lens catching invisible energies, the library's folded dimensions). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the placement sequence and breathing in the threshold moment. Two minor line-level frictions lower the score: "chased stillness she had pursued" in the penultimate paragraph is near-tautological, and the closing's "the underwater city remembered its purpose again, and the lighthouse lens, broken into new truth, showed the way" stacks two summarizing clauses that tell rather than show the transformation. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; syntax supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence structure and no major loops or scaffolding. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (e.g., "her heart hammered against her ribs, but her voice, when she spoke, was steady"). However, the final third includes near-paraphrase: "build intergenerational support" echoed in "create new ones together," and the closing lines restate the theme mechanically rather than charging the image. No figurative muddle, but propulsion softens in the ending exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in sensory passages. Minor scaffold appears: "Marina understood then" tells rather than shows the decision to proceed. The phrase "spiritually curious" repeats twice in close proximity. Metaphor density is elevated ("like smoke on her tongue," "light through a pinhole," "ink in water, like stars in fog") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are maintained, though the healing sequence could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and vocabulary is controlled, but several phrases edge toward overwriting: "like watercolor on wet paper," "like fading photographs left too long in sunlight," "like standing in a doorway between two mirrors" stack similes densely in a reflective mode without clear pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary. Minor paraphrase loop: "not dying but dispersing, becoming part of the garden's memory" restates the dissolution concept already vivid in prior lines. Clarity remains high; no major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the puzzle sequence. Minor loops: "The chains…she'd worn them" restates possession, and "Seeds…heritage varieties, drought-resistant strains, plants that remembered" drifts into list mode. The phrase "staggering grace" in the final line aims for lyricism but feels slightly forced. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: "seconds stretched like kelp in current" and "a violet-edged keen that tasted like autumn" deliver high information density with sensory precision. The opening and middle paragraphs vary rhythm and syntactic structure effectively. However, the final paragraph ("The sound sang crimson. The sound sang true. And somewhere in its resonance, trust learned...") stacks parallel constructions and leans into elevated register that borders on lyric overwriting; the repetition of "The sound sang" and the abstraction "trust learned how to begin reknitting itself" soften propulsion at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence elsewhere, but the ending's figurative density slightly obscures the concrete outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the flower-code paragraph and the moonbeam-curtain sequence. However, several metaphoric constructions border on overwriting: "bleeding orange and pink," "rustling petals," "luminous seeds," "luminous disbelief" cluster without always doing causal work. The final two paragraphs loop thematically—"threshold," "illuminated moment," "impossible light"—restating the premise rather than advancing it. Clarity remains high; no paraphrase loops or filter stacks in peak beats, but the figurative density in the closing third slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm. The opening lines anchor voice effectively. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "safe zones for inquiry" / "places where questions could exist," and "frozen moments" / "frozen motion" within two paragraphs. The metaphoric density in the final third ("winter's architecture collapsing, spring's beginning") occasionally tips toward decorative rather than propulsive, though it doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with selective sensory detail (rust-scented air, rough seashell edge). Opening and closing lines attempt resonance but the final paragraph loops thematic claims ("fear into purpose, vulnerability into the firmest foundation") in near-paraphrase. Template cadence appears in the climax: "She had outwitted him not through courage but through accepting..." followed by similar "not X but Y" constructions. The seashell "whispered approval" is a stock metaphor that blurs agency. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She heard," "She saw," "She felt") appear but do not pervasively dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level control is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful rhythm ("Another blast... Another gale"), high information density with most lines doing double work (setting + character state). Minor scaffold appears in the oracle's backstory paragraph with slight paraphrase loop ("listening to the spaces... the hush... the quiet"). The "summarizing silence" conceit risks abstraction but stays grounded through concrete examples (child's cry, predator's passing, snow falling). No major loops or template cadence runs; figurative language (amber, marble, veins in stone) remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives for sweeping, longer accumulations for reflection). Information density is high—most lines advance understanding of the loop-structure or J-7's evolving recognition. Two patterns create minor drag: "remarkably composed" appears three times (paragraphs 1, 7, final) without evolving meaning after the first use; "amalgamate/amalgamated/amalgamation" clusters heavily (paragraphs 2, 7, 8, 9) where synonyms like "merge," "synthesize," or "compound" could vary texture. Figurative language ("fractals," "sheet music written in pure cold") sharpens perception without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Weakness: "ambiguously clear" phrase recycled verbatim; "sacred silence" / "resonant hush" / "clean, rain-washed night" trend toward stock atmospheric phrases. The final paragraph's layered abstractions ("toward morning, toward accountability, toward whatever came after words became unnecessary") loop conceptually without adding concrete propulsion. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but figurative language clusters in opening and closing without all earning fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high across the excavation sequence. Clear propulsion through each marble recovery and positioning. Two minor artifacts: "blooming, withering kingdom, both verdant and dying, precisely as gardens truly are" stacks near-synonyms, and "small victories, elaborately remembered" appears twice with slight variation. The paraphrase loop "Gardens know their gardeners" (repeated three times across the piece) functions as motif but borders on redundancy in the final beat where it's rephrased as "Recognition."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean, but several issues accumulate: "mechanically warm smile, genuine beneath its practiced efficiency" is near-contradictory; "something impossible emerged, something that made her hands shake" is a paraphrase loop. "Cold light that somehow radiated warmth" muddles the vehicle. Template stems recur: "the moths had begun," "she pulled the lever," "he approached the hologram." Final paragraph over-explains theme with stock phrasing ("promise that tomorrow's twilight would bring new revelations").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong momentum through discovery beats. Information density is high: each object (program, lantern, journal) advances both plot and atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the closure: three successive "she would" constructions followed by parallel abstract phrases ("disrupt everything," "learn Magdalena's silent language"). The phrase "lately inspired by dreams of half-remembered melodies" in paragraph one is scaffolding that paraphrases the stated concept. Minor paraphrase loop: "wordless conversation" appears twice in final two paragraphs without reweighting. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity issues; deductions remain non-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during confession memory and breathing at the aurora description. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "the sorrow of it—how something so luminous could vanish" slightly over-explains what the image already conveys, and "proof that everything swayed, nothing stayed fixed" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. The smudge beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor issues: "drowsy alertness" appears three times (opening, midpoint, ending)—the final instance ("drowsy alertness of revelation") risks paraphrase loop and adds a slight explanatory cushion. The line "Eddie Torres deserved more than radio confessions and phantom sightings" tells rather than showing the cost, though it does not obscure closure. Information density is high; no major scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats loop conceptually: "witness change without judgment" / "chronicle transformation as an act of devotion rather than preservation" / "witnessing changes you even as you remain still" all restate her stance without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle ("The paper showed… She had watched… She had witnessed…") with parallel "She had" stems. Figurative language is dense ("fractal architecture that hurt to perceive," "cryptic symbols," "strange gravity") but mostly coherent. The final paragraph's summarizing reflection ("she would not remember… but she would feel") tells the aftermath rather than showing the present cost, dulling the closure beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with strong imagery ("roots ran deep and quiet," "otherworldly" light). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is solid. Minor deductions: "particular silence" and "particular satisfaction" repeat the same modifier within 800 words; "mellow presence" and "softly adaptive" sit close to label-only description in the opening; "ancient oaks" is generic. The eclipse sequence shows strong specificity (birds, temperature, double-edged shadows) without overwriting. No loops or scaffold artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with purpose. Strong specificity: "charred diary pages," "bronze quiet," "serpentine bodies woven in faded crimson and gold." No loops or paraphrase cycles detected. However, some figurative language trends ornamental rather than causal: "memories of kernels cascading like rain" and "dragons seemed to writhe in peripheral vision" are vivid but do not constrain choice or alter the historian's next move. Stock metaphor "dreams were the psyche's way of processing" appears in an expository paragraph. Overall momentum is steady but not propulsive; the reflective mode fits the design but limits sentence-level urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: "She crafted phrases like 'The lighthouse keeper knows what the tide conceals' and 'Rocky foundations hide transparent truths' with the same care a jazz musician transposes a melody…" economically establishes her work, method, and self-conception. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line ("She smiled at the familiar enigma of it all") recycles "familiar enigma" from the tone requirement rather than arising organically from prior imagery, reading slightly imposed. Two minor overwriting moments: "the enigma of someone who'd spent too long in the half-light between truth and tradecraft" and "the familiar enigma of it all" lean on abstraction. Figurative language (jazz transposition, the coat metaphor) is purposeful and controlled. No scaffolding or syntax monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structures shift between short declaratives ("It was true.") and longer syntactic builds that mirror the exorcism's layering. Information density is high: most lines advance metaphysics, atmosphere, or action simultaneously. "Decorates with silence" and "unraveled stillness" are vivid, character-specific phrases. Minor loops: "silence" appears heavily (silence, quiet, no sound) across multiple beats without always advancing new meaning, and "assumption" recurs four times in the climactic paragraph, creating slight redundancy. The phrase "muffled clarity" is used twice in close proximity (once as description, once as thematic tag), bordering on paraphrase. Stops short of 8+ due to these small density slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, several patterns weaken momentum: "chronologically homesick" appears three times in similar constructions; "upturned hush" recurs without added pressure; the phrase "unheard symphonies" is repeated identically. The opening "The glass spire caught first light like a prism" is vivid, but mid-story lines occasionally drift into abstract summary ("this mapping of moments into meaning, this translation of homesickness into hope"). Metaphors remain coherent and no major loops obscure causality, though "conductor of unheard symphonies" and "music of relationship" operate in adjacent registers without collision. Clarity and propulsion are generally strong, with minor synonym churn around "fortune" work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is generally high, with most sentences doing double work (setting + interiority, or timeline example + thematic weight). However, the story carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "The viaduct manifested every forty-three days, always after rain" repeats information already established, and the phrase "periodically eternal" recurs without functional variance. The middle section summarizing Timelines 847 and 2,193 uses template cadence ("In Timeline X, she had..."). Some filter-verb stacking ("felt all the fractured timelines pulse") and stock metaphors ("truth crystallized like ice forming on glass") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.5), and filter-verb stack penalties totals roughly −0.9, landing the score here.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally maintained and sentence structure varies, but several passages loop conceptually: "a numbing, a silence deeper than deafness, an emotional void" restates the same idea three ways without added pressure. The opening's "architecture of feeling itself" and closure's "thin, vital space where feeling breathes" carry similar abstract elevation that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language clusters in some beats ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "strange alchemy," "resurrection") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. The piece compresses weeks into summary rather than maintaining tight scene-level propulsion, and the final paragraph's "a whisper, then a song, then a resurrection" reads as rhythmic escalation but lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong specificity ("brass message tube," "amber-lit streets," "iron gate click"). Information density is high, especially in the exposition about the zone, which compresses backstory efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "recording facts / recorded the opposite / continue recording / recording in her mind" cycles across the piece without added pressure; "integrity" appears five times, three in close proximity. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "This was her integrity... It required... She wasn't choosing... She was choosing... She would continue..." The final beat is strong—"They would see the surface. She would continue recording the depths"—but the scaffold preceding it dulls momentum. No figurative muddle, and the opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor tone effectively. However, minor scaffold appears: "They didn't conquer or communicate—they simply existed" and "both familiar and utterly strange" lean on stock contrasts. The phrase "ethical playfulness dancing in her eyes" is a told trait rather than shown gesture. Figurative density is controlled, but "visual echoes," "fallen stars," and "liquid terra-cotta" cluster without clear payoff beyond atmosphere. No loops or major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally with purpose-driven detail. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character perception, or thematic resonance simultaneously. Two minor issues prevent higher scoring: (1) Near-paraphrase in the bonfire backstory—"voices layering over crackling wood, each tale building on the last" closely mirrors "how sound could gather and grow, how it could dance between people"—triggers −0.2 for loop structure. (2) The phrase "more than enough" at the story's penultimate beat edges toward scaffold reassurance. Otherwise the prose is clear, propulsive, and free of figurative muddle. Opening and closing images effectively frame the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or theme (the grotto's dual purposes, static electricity as diagnostic tool, blotter mechanics). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half truth, technically accurate" in paragraph two is restated as "another half truth forming" in paragraph nine, and "professionally thorough" recurs four times with diminishing marginal pressure. The metaphor "purple lightning" and "amber current" is vivid but slightly strained when extended to "subsume the purple chaos." Opening and closing lines bracket cleanly. Minimal filter-verb stacks; syntax is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally strong. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "She'd never thought to thank them properly" restates what the prior paragraph already dramatized through her recognition. The final paragraph layers metaphors ("symphony had ended," "music that had always played," "rhythm of hands and hearts") without clear progression. "Carrying plans to uplift those who'd been silent contributors too long" tells what the conversation already showed. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, but the closing beats over-explain.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, several phrasesLoop conceptually: "luminescent ache" appears twice, "webs of kinship" recurs without evolving pressure, and the "beyond the murmur" frame repeats at beginning and end as bracket rather than charged callback. Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors ("glass-like trees refracting light into prismatic shadows," "frozen smoke," "bioluminescent memory") that cluster without clear necessity. Clarity remains intact; no major scaffold or filter stacks. One paraphrase loop: "the search was the point" and "the searching itself" convey identical content in adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or adds sensory texture. Sentence openings vary cleanly. Minor issues: "suspended quiet" and "suspended between the towers" echo within two paragraphs; "borrowed time she'd collected hummed" employs a stock metaphor that doesn't quite land with specificity. Figurative language (time "thick as honey, thin as wire") is vivid but clusters in one beat without full payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Propulsion is strong through the cage sequence, though the opening two paragraphs lean slightly expository before momentum kicks in.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences modulate from short declaratives ("Then he waited") to longer lyric constructions. Information density is high in the cavern description. Two friction points: "That was ambiguous loss: mourning someone neither gone nor staying" interrupts with exposition; the final paragraph stacks abstract metaphors ("dovetailing loss and hope," "equations deep enough," "gently, persistently whole") that blur propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense in the closure paragraph but remains legible; however, elevated diction ("theorem," "calculus," "progression") in peak beats risks distancing emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density: "eleven months," "pipe chases," "heating ducts on the third floor" anchor survival specifics. Rhythm varies well—short urgency ("The boy didn't run") and longer reflective beats. Minor loop: "kindly methodical care" appears twice with identical phrasing, and "the sapphire hush" / "sapphire-blue light" recur without reweighting. The final line's syntax—"two people who had learned to hide began the harder work of being seen"—lands cleanly. No major artifacts; one paraphrase slip lowers momentum slightly in the middle ("She had become invisible by necessity" after prior survival detail).

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and purposeful detail (caterpillar lacework on the leaf, "heart-shaped form"). However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "study had become control, and control had become obsession" is functional but template-like; "transformation affected even his speech patterns" tells what the prior beat showed. The phrase "taking the long route they always did when he spoke difficult truths" is scaffolding that could be cut. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("growth requires surrender, that strength comes from flexibility, and that the most profound changes...") in a thesis-like cadence that dulls momentum. Minimal filter-verb stacking; no major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance image, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("the insect trapped inside perfectly preserved, suspended in its moment of golden catastrophe"). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the convergence sequence. Two minor frictions: "haggard awe that hollowed her own" edges toward stock phrasing, and "ridiculous ceremony that mattered absolutely" slightly over-explains the paradox. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (drowning/resurrection, pooling meaning, amber as suspension). The final image recharges prior motifs without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the cave-pearl sequence and shadow-emergence beats. Minor loop friction: "bright darkness" recurs three times (opening cathedral, overlapping description, final shadows), and while the reprise charges closure, the middle use feels decorative. "Steadily unpredictable" is an oxymoron that works once but draws attention. Figurative density is managed well except for a brief cluster in paragraph three ("wind chime of living stone," "cathedral of bright darkness," "throat") that slightly slows momentum. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Propulsion is strong through the middle and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with minimal scaffold. "Reactively visionary" and the staggered-interval method are compressed efficiently. However, figurative density in the opening ("air tasted of salt and forgiveness," "foam that dissolves on rocks," "cartography of what was no longer there") clusters without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "the old routes" echoed across paragraphs without advancing pressure. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose carries vivid images (crystallized silence, luminous moths) and clear propulsion through the journey. However, template cadence appears in repeated "she [verb]" openings across the fortress sequence, and paraphrase loops emerge: "mapping known territories" vs. "mapping what couldn't be seen" restates rather than advances. Figurative density peaks in the fortress description without always adding pressure—"cathedral of whispers," "luminous moths," "warm and alive" stack without differentiation. The final paragraph summarizes the resolution ("she would spend the rest of her days") rather than dramatizing it, lowering information density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Ever the sympathetic skeptic" anchors trait and stance in three words). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout; figurative language ("kindness hollowed her bones," "invisible mathematics") is purposeful and doesn't muddle peak beats. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final image attempts to recharge motifs. Minor register drift in "entangled memories binding ocean to cosmos" elevates diction slightly beyond the established medical-practical voice, but doesn't obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("She had hours, then, to discover…" versus the staccato "The fragment pulsed once, twice"). Information density is high: most lines advance both world-state and interiority. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. The figurative language ("whispered promises," "hushed thunder of dimensions rearranging") remains coherent and voice-matched, avoiding register drift. Minor scaffold appears in "what seventeen thousand years of goodbyes had actually meant," which slightly restates the premise, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening paragraph (formaldehyde, tools, Marcus Chen's roles, the arrest, the ink pot's dual meaning). The 4 AM discovery beat is clean and propulsive. Deductions: "liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry," "deathly vitality," and "mathematics of a fair trade" repeated thrice show slight overwriting and template phrasing. "Asylum in a thousand different forms" in the final line is abstracting and slightly generic. A paraphrase loop appears: "mathematics of a fair trade" (paragraph 3) and "impossible mathematics" (paragraph 8) without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for patterned metaphor density and loop; the artifacts do not touch closure directly but dull two supporting beats.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the workshop and labyrinth passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "infinite worlds" recurs across paragraphs without reweighting, and the closure's three-sentence thematic summary restates the premise with synonym churn ("collect and preserve what had never occurred" / "give weight to invention"). The lamp-hum notation is described but not shown in action on the page, creating a told-only effect. No line-level opacity at closure, but the final paragraph's summary reduces propulsion by −0.4 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but several patterns accumulate: "She'd been discovering," "She'd been a whistleblower," "She'd fled" repeat the past-perfect scaffold. "Fragments" appears seven times, creating lexical monotony. The phrase "those who'd resisted had their histories erased more permanently" and the immediate reveal "Like hers" form a paraphrase loop. Figurative density ("sedimentary evidence," "texture of memories," "contaminated with lies") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, plus −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid ("dust motes dancing over abandoned star charts"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "voices didn't disappear when forgotten" is restated as "voices go everywhere...waiting patiently" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density in the closure beat ("crystallized like frost on glass," "acoustic ghosts," "whisper of closing pages") stacks without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity (−0.4). Stock phrasing like "broken something in Marina's skeptical heart" and "gloomy cheerfulness" recycled from prompt language lower specificity. No major scaffold or text artifacts beyond these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance character, conflict, or world. Two minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats ("wanted to hate him," "felt something she'd almost forgotten") slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality. The phrase "orderly intuitive thinking" reads as convenient label rather than dramatized trait. The closing metaphor "anchor to the past, but a seed for future growth" is effective but borders on overstatement given prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Information density is high in the beacon-planting sequence, and sensory details (emerald copper, magnesium blooms) are vivid. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "crater inspector moved" / "Maya had three hours" restates WHO; "couldn't outlast the consortium's lawyers" / "could at least outlast the darkness" recycles structure; "Valentina was different. Valentina was perfect" is synonym churn. The final paragraph stacks modifiers ("golden, eternal, and hers") where one would suffice. Template cadence in backstory paragraphs ("He'd fallen... He'd filled...") and minor filter-verb clusters ("feeling the slope give way") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. Deduction −0.6 for loops and stacks, plus −0.2 for filter density.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the repair beats—each action advances understanding of method. Minor template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("The day would bring...," "Outside, the mist...") and a paraphrase loop between "magnetic calm" and "small miracles commonplace" slightly flatten momentum. The phrase "heartfelt dedication" in paragraph five reads as authorial assertion rather than dramatized state. No major loops or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Clarity is high, though "singular convergence point, working in reverse" and "deep time or geography she couldn't yet map" edge toward abstract summary when concrete image would sharpen. Minor scaffold in "She lit the oil lamp, though afternoon light still filtered" (the "though" clause adds little momentum). No loops or template cadence; information density is strong in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level clarity and rhythm are strong; sentence openings vary, figurative language (ebony fork "drinking in" light, frequency "felt more than heard") is specific and coherent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "Her motivation was simple, though the method was not" and the backstory summary ("seven years once," "entire winter") tell rather than dramatize, diluting momentum in the first third. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Information density high in ritual beats, but the closure paragraph's declarative summary ("The collapse would not come. Not today…") leans abstract rather than anchoring in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop: "lonesome splendor" appears in paragraph one and the penultimate line, which is intentional callback but borders on self-echo. Template cadence in the memory-flood paragraph: "She saw...The priests had gathered...They had nearly succeeded. Then the earthquakes came" uses repetitive sentence stems without pattern-teaching, costing momentum (−0.4). No significant filter stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery: "The lighthouse prison clung to its reef like a barnacle to dying stone," "dust hover in those amber columns like suspended secrets." Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "hush" is explained three times in slightly different language; "copper light" appears in five separate paragraphs doing similar descriptive work. Template cadence in the backstory section ("His father had shattered hush... had weaponized alarm... had been seven"). These reduce propulsion in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    Opening and closing lines are imagistic and apt, but mid-story pacing suffers from paraphrase loops and summary scaffolding. "She had been alone here for three seasons" is functional exposition, but the next beat—"Then came the first appearance"—reads as template cadence. The phrase "mournful elation" appears in the final paragraph as a label rather than an embodied sensation, reducing immediacy. Several sentences restate content without adding pressure: "Each glimpse lasted only heartbeats" and "ephemeral cameo appearances" cover the same ground. Loop and scaffold issues trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7, capping the category in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, several loops and scaffolds appear: "The labyrinth breathed" is asserted twice without new meaning; "stillness had never been its purpose" is immediately followed by "not the worship of dust but the honoring of original intent," a paraphrase loop. "Orchid solace" is defined in exposition rather than emerging from image. Figurative density ("like neural pathways, like the way water knows its course") stacks without causal work. The closing paragraph's "perpetual, communal becoming" abstracts rather than grounds the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information density is high: most sentences do double work (e.g., "roots had broken through the catacomb ceiling, snaking between skulls and ribcages, drawing sustenance from the bone-rich earth" grounds setting, advances the grotesque-sacred logic, and primes the inversion theme). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence that breathes during reflection and tightens during discovery beats. One minor loop: "She would leave again, she knew. But this time, she would return" in the final paragraph echoes the opening's "This time, she told herself, would be different" without adding new pressure, though the shift from self-assertion to grounded certainty justifies the reprise. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, no metaphor muddle. The "wooden lightning" image for roots is fresh and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (the clipboard property, the arcade's history, the Youth Communication Act context), and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively, and the final line recharges the graphite/ephemerality motif with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in the middle third—"the weight of paper, the deliberation of ink, the journey of a letter through human hands" reads slightly list-like, and "futuristic nostalgia that permeated Maya's generation" edges toward prompt echo—keeps this below the 9+ threshold, but clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance observation, pattern, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer accumulative sentences during conspiracy assembly, short declarations at the turn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges threads and synchronization. Minor loop: "adjacent possibilities" recurs four times in similar constructions without evolving semantically, trending toward synonym churn. One mixed metaphor: "conspiracies unraveling" as leaves is elegant but "unraveling in reverse, becoming visible" reverses the vehicle mid-image. No filter-verb stacks or severe opacity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("roots twisted like frozen thoughts," "singing their contents into the roots"), but some metaphors drift toward abstraction without grounding ("ghost of what you meant to send," "space where an apology waits unspoken"). The piece avoids major loops but carries minor scaffold: "The singing spirits crescendoed, their voices forming a luminous path" recaps the spirits' role without adding new pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates, and clarity holds. Line-level control is solid but not exceptional; the elevated register persists uniformly without degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high. Minor issues: "shared anxieties bloomed between them like night-flowering jasmine" stacks metaphor in a high-pressure beat; "understanding flooding through her" is stock; "the work of translation—not just of words, but of grief into remembrance, of loss into preservation, of silence into testimony" is a structured list that risks scaffold rhythm. The final paragraph's "two translators... unknotting the past one careful word at a time" borders on summary rather than image. No loops or major clarity problems, but figurative density in key beats and one thematic summary prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: fog as spilled milk, photograph developing in reverse, edible stars. Minor muddle: "fog-space" and "daydream fold" blur slightly without adding precision. Template cadence appears in the knowledge network comments section: three nearly identical "I remember/My grandmother's/This is the feeling" structures, creating a brief rhythm stall. Paraphrase loop: "The fog became her canvas" and earlier "fog made everything uncertain, dreamlike" restate mood without advancing pressure. Information density is otherwise strong, and the final paragraph propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most sentences advance situation, perception, or theme. The opening anchors setting and character efficiently. Minor template-cadence issue: "Each time, the murals were different... Each time, she found herself... Each time, she remembered" runs three identical stems in succession, creating mild monotony (−0.4). The figurative language ("memories felt thin, like paint watered down") is specific and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative pressure without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is largely clean with good information density and purposeful compression (the montage summary trades scene time for momentum). Strong specific images anchor key beats: "beetle wings," "seeds rattled inside like imprisoned thoughts," "green cursive." However, template cadence appears in the opening beat: "He'd gathered them here... He shook it gently... He distributed seeds..." creates a repetitive stem pattern. The metaphor "seeds became syntax, gardens became libraries" reads as elegant summary but arrives without prior dramatization of the coding mechanics. One paraphrase loop: "charming rogue scholar" in narration echoes "roguish charm" two paragraphs later. The final image juxtaposition (towers blink / language takes root) is visually clean but relies on parallel construction rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two frictions pull the score down: "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" repeats the "off-key" descriptor awkwardly within the same sentence, and "ensconce the bulb" leans purple where "plant" or "nest" would sharpen momentum. Sentence openings vary; no paraphrase loops. Information density is high. The closure image is clean and propulsive, but earlier beats carry slight overwriting that dulls immediacy without obscuring cause.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; no hard loops or template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting: "deserted marvels" appears three times, "foxglove regret" twice, and phrases like "the voices of people speaking words that no longer existed" lean slightly purple without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motifs cleanly. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: "buying herself precious seconds" does three jobs (characterization, pacing, stakes). Rhythm varies effectively—short declarative "Together" after the longer collaborative paragraph. Minor loop: "interconnected promises" appears three times across the piece without enough functional variation between uses. The "war in his eyes—hurt against hope, anger against fascination" construction is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language (frozen tear, prism, symphonies) remains coherent and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("throat of stone," "amber" walls at sunset). Minor loops appear: "the building breathed" recurs three times in similar phrasing, and "compassion" + "encrypted" + "harmonize" cycle without fresh angles. The phrase "fragile as hope" and "steady as breath" are stock constructions. Information density is adequate; no major clarity issues, but the final third summarizes Elena's three-day work rather than dramatizing a key moment of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("dust motes swirled to the rhythm of dead voices," "words hurt like new growth"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. The phrase "blooming with possibility and withering with guilt simultaneously" risks slight overwriting, and "blooming and withering and somehow, finally, beginning to heal" in the confession paragraph stacks similar metaphors within close proximity (−0.3 for density). No loops or scaffold detected. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the opening/closing lines anchor and resolve effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("slow-breathing glass," "whorls," "prismatic fragments"). Information density is high. Minor issues: "featherly determination" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small loop. The phrase "fractured hush that permeated the terrace" reads slightly ornamental without adding pressure. One filter stack: "She'd learned...watching him analyze...He'd taught her...told her" compresses three past actions in quick succession, dulling immediacy slightly. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; sentences advance atmosphere and discovery without loops. Opening and closing images (burnt feather drifting; plankton blooming) frame the arc. Information density is high in the data-convergence passage. However, several phrases repeat template cadence: "thick with barnacles and the weight of salt-dark mystery," "shadowseam wonder—half-glimpsed connections," "luminous respite from darkness that promises transformation." The closure beat relies on two extended metaphors (fireflies, old song) that layer rather than propel. "Softly ingenious," "captivate," and "shadowseam wonder" appear as untethered modifiers. No severe artifacts, but cumulative effect nudges toward overwriting in a high-band story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most sentences do double work. The opening grounds voice and stakes efficiently. However, several template stems recur under pressure: "She had devoted," "She had always assumed," "She couldn't restore." Minor paraphrase loop: "each one a small tragedy, each one perfectly, necessarily temporary" restates without added detail. The figurative language ("like memories dissolving into mist," "like foam dissolving into sea") is coherent but the sea-foam/dissolution pairing appears three times in a short text. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; these are hairline slips that don't touch closure but prevent entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance Marina's method or the convergence. Rhythm varies, though some passages stack filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew," "she began") without pressure payoff. Two paraphrase loops: "catalogued them all, calculating vectors and velocities, predicting convergences" restates the analytical stance already shown; "not truly random, not entirely controlled" echoes "ordering randomness" from earlier. The figurative language ("serenade monotony," "negative spaces between cause and effect") occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with the scene-level specificity. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor issues: "She had been the capital's most skilled tide dancer" front-loads exposition that could anchor through action; "She began with her grandmother's name, pressing the luminous dust into her forearm" summarizes the pivotal tattooing act rather than dwelling in its texture. Template stems appear: "She danced her history," "She stilled completely," "She began with." "Moonstone cabochon dust speck" repeats the full phrase when "speck" or "dust" would suffice. These artifacts remain above the threshold for meaningful penalty but prevent entry to higher bands. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("mist that clung to the shoreline like gauze," "cathedral of suspended droplets") is vivid without overwhelming. However, several lines loop or pad: "He'd come because he'd learned to read between the lines" followed immediately by restating the developer's contradiction; "patterns never repeated exactly; they were familiar yet novel, like jazz variations" is near-redundant. The phrase "to illuminate value in the mundane" and "watch how light bends...watch how patterns speak" use template repetition. "The prism atrium in mist had revealed its purpose through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown" is syntactically strained and summarizes rather than trusts the prior dramatization. Clarity remains high, but density suffers from these scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies adequately; sentence openings shift between subject-verb and participial. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (scars as metaphor and plot fact, box as heirloom and symbol)—but several beats paraphrase without advancement: the "bargained innocence" concept is restated three times across paragraphs without new pressure. Template stems appear ("Marcus had come to," "Marcus understood now," "Each [X] was [Y]") in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild cadence monotony. Mixed metaphor: "absorbing shame" and "burned out, fuel exhausted" apply incompatible vehicles (sponge vs. combustion). No loops touch the closure beat, capping deductions at −0.8 per the artifact pack, but cumulative scaffold prevents entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing images frame the piece cleanly. However, the middle section contains paraphrase loops: "hope wasn't a constant. It was a variable..." followed immediately by "Hope was the integral..." restates the same insight. Template phrasing recurs: "She'd learned to observe," "She felt rather than saw," "She had found what she was looking for." The formula paragraph ("hope equaled the probability...") reads as exposition rather than scene pressure, flattening momentum at the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful") without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or layer meaning (ivy recoils, equipment detects, negatives reveal, understanding shifts). Minimal scaffolding; one paraphrase near "He believed buildings remember. That they store our lives..." recaps the diary content but adds frantic tone. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates during the anomaly beat and slows for reflection. One stock phrase: "her breath caught" is functional but generic. The final beat ("corridor sighed") is clean and charged. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. A few elevated abstractions ("emotional archaeology," "legacy's burden") fit the intellectual register but edge toward thematic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "borrowed heartbeat" appears five times, "mirrors" dominates without varied proxies, and "possibilities rather than mere reflections" / "what might have been" / "the possible" cycle through near-synonyms. The metaphor "mirage painter" seeds early but doesn't constrain later choices. Two paraphrase moments: "elusive" recurs in the frame without added pressure; "sustained by the heartbeat that reminded her" restates prior interiority. Figurative language is controlled but "ribbons of color" and "landscapes of the possible" edge toward stock poeticism. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening long sentence contrasts with short declarations later ("No," Mirena agreed.). Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in the reflection block ("The price of redemption, she had learned, was remembering every failure" / "The price of redemption, Mirena thought...") which loops a phrase across paragraphs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("brittle as old parchment," "flawed beauty") is sparing and apt. The clipboard's physical weight and texture are concretely rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt that crunched like old bones" = sensory + metaphor + thematic echo). Rhythm varies purposefully: clipped sentences at climax, longer backstory blocks earlier. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "beautiful and broken, a grace assembled from fragments" stacks three near-synonyms in final paragraph, risking overwriting; "Thunder rolled again, closer now, but still distant enough" uses hedge ("but still") that could tighten. Overall propulsion is strong and scaffold is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clear and maintains forward momentum, with varied sentence structures and no major grammatical errors. However, several patterns reduce density: "bodily poetic" appears three times as a label without evolving meaning; "threads" becomes a synonym loop (untangling, knotting, separating) across multiple paragraphs; stock metaphors like "the color of pearl and promise" and "seeds in the minds" dilute specificity. The phrase "alarming serenity" is used twice with identical phrasing. Mid-story, lines like "The threads she had untangled would never knot the same way again" function as scaffold summary rather than advancing pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice adequately, but the peak transformation beat relies on assertion ("something fundamental had shifted") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in performance beats. Template cadence surfaces in the partner-conflict exposition: "thought she understood," "accusations still echoing," "words stung because" creates a mild filter-verb stack that slightly dulls the opening. The "meteor hush" metaphor appears twice with slightly different framing ("meteor's silent streak across the sky—all awe, no thunder"), which reads as intentional echo but borders on paraphrase. Propulsion remains strong through the performance sequence with no major loops.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure modulates with scene pressure. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, action, or character. Minor paraphrase loop: "the monarchs began lifting away, continuing their interrupted journey north" restates the opening premise without fresh pressure. Stock metaphor: "paper made from whispers" is evocative but leans generic. One filter-verb cluster ("She understood what drew her to this work") dulls immediacy. Opening and closing lines are strong ("bloomed green against impossible sky" / "already transiently rooted to her next forgotten place"). Grammar and sequence clarity are clean throughout. The artifacts touch mid-story beats, not closure, limiting deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("ribbons of green and violet," "snowmelt ardor") is integrated without overwriting. Minor deduction: a few phrases edge toward elevated diction ("transcribed in many ways," "shaped reality") that slightly exceed the artisan voice under peak stress, and "the aurora sang above her" in the final beat risks lyric overreach. No paraphrase loops or template stems. Sentence openings vary; clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor template-cadence slip in the dream paragraph: three consecutive "She saw/was" constructions without deliberate patterning. One paraphrase loop: "hardly mattered which anymore" echoes the prior sentence's idea without adding pressure. The "magnificent truth" phrase in the penultimate paragraph is slightly elevated for the moment. Figurative language (vines as fingers, paths as alive) is consistent and coherent, though dense in the dream beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and moves with purpose; information density is high (each paragraph advances discovery). Rhythm varies adequately, though runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems appear in the middle section without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Figurative language ("violet hour," "starlight," "dusky amber glow," "dusky harmony") recurs but stays purposeful and voice-consistent. Minor density slip: "Her motivation had always been singular: to seal a covenant with the unknown, to bridge the terrible gap between human comprehension and cosmic truth" restates the same idea in two clauses without added pressure. Copy is clean; no grammar, tense, or pronoun errors. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery: "silence could amplify the body's whispered truths," "reality was already beginning its weekly shift." Some paraphrase loops appear: "Your cells remember everything" followed two paragraphs later by "Your body remembers being a child" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in Elena's monologue beats (""Your sister's actions…," "Cellular memory…," "The resentment taught…") creates a persuasive-speech pattern that risks homogeneity. Opening and closing images are strong, but mid-scene relies on conceptual repetition (cellular memory, shifting grace) rather than propulsive new information. No major artifacts touch closure, though the final paragraph's "teacher who had finished its lesson" edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is controlled and coherent ("blown glass, refracting what little light penetrated the mist into impossible colors"). Minor loop: the phrase "firmly grounded" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs without added pressure in the reprise—a small echo that could be cut or reweighted. No paraphrase cycles, grammar is clean, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. The final image ("sharp and beautiful as glass mountains dissolving into memory") recycles the glass-mountains motif with fresh context.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong; rhythm varies naturally and syntax accelerates under pressure ("breathing hard," "fumbled with her bag"). Information density is high: most lines do double duty (the ribbon is both object and emotional anchor; the orchard is setting and thematic mirror). Minor scaffold: "Among the usual tools—grinding stones, polishing cloths, calibration rods—her fingers found something forgotten" uses a list interrupter that slightly stalls momentum. No loops or template cadence; figurative language ("apple blossoms," "fruit ripened") is selective and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("silver fruit bloom backward through time," "breath forming crystals"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Paraphrase loops appear: "backward blossoming" / "bloom backward" and "simply complicated" recurs three times without escalating pressure, feeling like scaffold. The phrase "between the first and last page" appears four times, crossing from motif into churn. Filter-verb stack in the bathroom scene ("she'd discovered," "she held," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy. Minor template cadence in the catalog of trees (pomegranate tree / fig tree / one tree). Closure image is vivid but the "grandfather's eyes" line borders on over-explicit thematic capping.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; paragraph structure supports beats. Figurative language density is high throughout ("harmonic shift," "probability spirals," "linguistic singularities," "verbal flowers," "semantic evolution," "unheard symphony") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure; this risks ornamental overwriting. Clarity holds across beats; no loops or scaffold. One minor simultaneity slip: "She began to speak…The mountain listened" implies instant response without clear elapsed beat. Information density is strong; sentences multitask. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("fog so thick it felt like breathing wool," "carousel horses stood frozen mid-gallop"). Information density is solid; most sentences advance atmosphere or concept. Minor paraphrase loop in the twins' shifting ages paragraph (yesterday/today/tomorrow structure repeats the same content without added pressure). Template cadence appears in the storytelling sequence: "She told the tale where... She told the version where... She told the story where" runs three times with identical stems, triggering −0.4. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks ("monument to trapped freedom, that vessel of unkindled solace") without clear propulsion. No major scaffold or clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with strong information density (each paragraph advances discovery or choice). However, template cadence appears in clustered sentence stems: "She'd learned," "She found," "She understood," "She set down," "Her fingers worked"—a run of simple subject-verb frames across the second half that flattens rhythm during high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "understand why these absences persisted" / "translate confusion into clarity" recycles the same conceptual content. The climactic braiding sequence summarizes action ("unbraiding and rebraiding") rather than dramatizing tactile struggle, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Gently luminous" appears identically in three separate beats (lantern, ice cracks, final glow), creating a decorative loop rather than evolved meaning. The phrase "energy beings" repeats five times without variation, and "echo chamber stone" runs through multiple paragraphs with minor template cadence. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "bloom of hush," "hammered repose," "lightning caught in stone." The loops and scaffold prevent entry to the high band despite strong rhythm and clarity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong specific images: "past bled through her fingers like water through cupped hands," "sound like an exhaled breath," "tiny parachutes of hope." However, several lines loop or paraphrase without adding pressure—"the pattern demanded completion. Because coincidence was the universe's way of insisting that meaning survived" restates the same idea across two sentences. Template cadence appears in the opening ("She had been... she'd stumbled... she'd been born") and in the star-tracking paragraph ("she'd studied... she'd begun to notice... she'd proposed"). Figurative density is high but controlled; the thistle metaphor recurs purposefully. Information density is good; momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. The piece avoids major loops, though some phrasing recurs thematically ("preemptively nostalgic," "deepening hush," "sculpt identity from experience") in a pattern-taught way. Figurative language is controlled ("solid fog rippled like muscle beneath skin," "pages made from harvested light") and serves the speculative setting. Minor template cadence in the opening ("She was...She stood...She examined") across three consecutive paragraphs, but the effect reads as intentional grounding rather than artifact. No major clarity issues; the prose propels without significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes without padding. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("gravity of hopelessness," "temporary poetry," "ash to ember, ember to sky") is purposeful and integrated. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences: "She smiled, the expression sharp..." could compress to eliminate the appositive filter. "Through ambient awareness" recurs as a label without always showing the sensory particulars of that sixth sense. The climax—fireworks sequence—sustains propulsion and vivid image without loops. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs mar peak beats, keeping the score comfortably above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the hermit crab both advances plot understanding and mirrors theme). Rhythm varies appropriately, slowing for observation and quickening in dialogue. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; sentence openings vary naturally. One minor issue: "warmly observant" appears twice as authorial commentary rather than dramatized through action, creating slight register drift. The final paragraph's repetition of "pause" and "transition" vocabulary edges toward template cadence but remains purposeful rather than artifactual. Figurative language (cicada's "interior weather," ocean's "whisper") is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. "The stalk had grown into a xenial trellis above the clouds, a latticework of green that welcomed climbers" does double work: world-building and tonal setup. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop: "The gilded hush was her obsession" (paragraph 4) and "But the gilded hush remained elusive" (paragraph 6) restate without adding pressure—acceptable transition but slightly soft. The synaesthetic cluster in the flower paragraph is dense ("tasted like honey and sounded like light, if light could resonate. It was the silence of growth, of potential becoming actual, of the moment before something beautiful is born") and risks overwriting, but the stakes are high enough and the pattern (layered sensory translation) is taught, so it reads as purposeful intensification rather than purple excess. No significant scaffold or pronoun ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the man's arc. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "the hush vaulting upward into the pale sky" and "fluidly logical as breath, as grief" are specific and voice-coherent. Minor: "catalyze effect" reads as a near-typo (likely "catalyst"); filter verbs ("she had learned," "she had tried") cluster in the reflective blocks but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. The final sentence's triadic rhythm ("as breath, as grief, as the slow work") charges the closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop near-synonyms: "cataloging the memory-circuits" / "corrupted data fragments," "wisely adventurous" appears twice as filler. "Futuristic and ancient all at once" in the final line is abstract summary rather than concrete image. Minor template cadence in the ascent paragraph ("carved with names… committing each"). No clarity breaks, but figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("compressed starlight and human ambition").

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and vivid imagery ("watercolor bleeding into paper," "drowning on dry land"). A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "I burned it all" followed immediately by a list restating the same act. The phrase "loaded emptiness" recurs three times without accumulating new meaning, verging on decorative repetition. Two scaffold phrases—"Neither did I, at first" and "Good," Maya said softly—read as template-cadence beats that could be cut without loss. No severe artifacts touch the closure image, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster in key beats: "Perhaps pressure" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs (pressure as reveal / pressure as transformation), creating mild synonym churn. The phrase "quantum promises" is repeated four times without evolving meaning. "Volunteer" appears as both noun and verb across multiple lines, flattening propulsion. The final paragraph stacks three declarative clauses in parallel ("The mushrooms blazed… Maya stood… She smiled…"), creating template cadence at closure. Apply −0.6 for loop/template patterns touching the ending and −0.3 for metaphor density ("sticky residue," "crystalline shards," "coal of regrets," "diamonds") without payoff in a single high-pressure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance discovery, reflect character knowledge, or layer setting detail. Clarity is strong; spatial choreography (room → gramophone → safe → hidden compartment) tracks cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "The dynasty was ended, but perhaps something better could begin" restates the prior paragraph's closure without adding pressure. One metaphor stack in the opening ("held its breath," "first yawn," "paint everything in sepia") front-loads figurative language before settling into clearer action. Rhythm varies purposefully, though "golden shadows" recurs four times with diminishing specificity. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image recharges the sepia/golden motif with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm and sentence variety are controlled, but the prose carries persistent elevated register and near-redundant phrasing: "terror and ecstasy braided together, a shivering bliss" restates rather than advances. Filter verbs appear sparingly. The opening "had not spoken" and "had withdrawn" are clean setup; the final image "waiting for the choreography of transformation" is slightly abstract but legible. Paraphrase loops like "not controlled but controlling, not suspended but suspending" feel decorative rather than propulsive. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize transformation rather than dramatizing micro-steps.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean with strong information density—most sentences advance discovery or characterization. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: "Inside, a matron's notes described..." flows into shorter beats at key turns. The dust-as-text opening and the benediction ending frame the arc effectively. Figurative language is controlled: button "like a flower, like a prayer," dust motes "like benedictions." Deductions: "She had arrived...six months after her husband died at Andersonville" front-loads backstory in a somewhat scaffold-like construction; "small mysteries...small mercies" leans on repetitive "small" modifiers; final paragraph risks slight overwriting with "dust motes drifting golden through the lamplight" stacking visual detail. No paraphrase loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean with strong information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, template cadence, or significant artifacts. A few lines approach stock phrasing ("the ghost geography of the vanished coastal district," "comfortable tyranny of indifference") but remain functional. The puddle-map sequence is concretely rendered. Clarity and propulsion are consistent; the piece moves efficiently without scaffolding. Minor hedge: "more than that" is a small connector crutch, but overall line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is mostly lean with strong momentum. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially in the playing sequence. Minor loop: "quietly vivid increments" in paragraph two echoes "eerie nostalgia" construction from paragraph one without adding pressure. The phrase "something luminous and alive" at the grotto entry is slightly generic. "Hush" appears nine times; while thematically apt, "hushing what needed to be hushed" in the climax reads slightly circular. Information density is high throughout; clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with short, urgent sentences during the moonstone discovery ("She recognized them") and longer accumulative cadences in the monument-building climax. However, several artifacts appear: "She who reads the falling leaves shall know the shape of tomorrow" is generic prophecy phrasing; "more vital than breath" is stock intensifier; "hammer with recognition" and "bloomed within her like flowers from ash" are familiar metaphors. Template stems recur in paragraph structure ("She built," "She placed," "She prodded," "She had decoded," "She would begin"). Information density is high in the moonstone-prodding sequence but dilutes in the reflection-heavy middle paragraphs. Clarity remains intact; no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and informationally dense. Strong opening line anchors voice and stakes. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("compass needles toward some invisible magnetic truth," "time bent around itself like light around gravity") is vivid and legible. Deductions: slight overwriting in the conservatory entrance ("loomed gray," "jungle of neglect," "vines had reclaimed") where two of three images would suffice; "uncertainly certain" and "beautiful recursion" repeat across paragraphs without additional pressure, risking decorative recurrence rather than earned motif. The phrase "watching through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse as her boots disturbed patterns" contains a minor sequence ambiguity (she is inside the conservatory, not watching "through" from outside). Overall strong clarity and propulsion with minor density slips.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop conceptually: "balanced alchemist" is restated as equilibrium/dissolution/coagulation in the opening, and "names" recur in abstract variations without new pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("luminous regret," "molecular dance," "beautiful fissures," "deep shimmer") without pattern-teaching or a cadence shift at closure. The phrase "factually mystical" is coined but not dramatized—its mechanics remain "wrapped in the language of the heavens." Minor template cadence in the ritual sequence ("heated… placed… traced… spoke… added"). No major clarity breaks, but the elevated register never modulates under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Sentence variety supports momentum, and information density is high ("distorted notes...slip between the confessions like a hand through water"). Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph: "luminous ache of dawn, healing sounded like laughter threaded through tears, wrong notes made right" stacks metaphors without adding causal detail. One paraphrase loop: "misaligned harp" recurs frequently without functional variation. No major loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Grammar and punctuation are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length modulates with pressure. Information density is high: most lines advance character state, environment interaction, or thematic exploration. Minor loop detected: "her body had become a precision instrument" and the proprioceptive descriptions risk template cadence in the middle section, though each instance adds new specificity (footfall, insects, muscle fiber tension). No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The carving sequence propels cleanly: wrong equations are crossed out on the page, showing failed attempts without summary. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges the pewter strap motif with new weight (acceptance rather than constraint). Figurative language ("each tree a glowing cipher") is purposeful and not overdense.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are strong through the market and workshop sequences. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery or deepen stakes. Template cadence appears in the research paragraph: "She held... She worked... The paintings revealed..." stacks three consecutive subject-verb openers. The phrase "elusively tangible" recurs three times without meaningful variation, becoming a tic. "Suspended in an eternal instant" and "crystallized feeling where past and future collapsed" blur into synonym loops. Minor filter-verb density in "she could have sworn she saw" when "she saw" would be more immediate. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "anchors of intuition," "hidden layers," "layered geography of overlapping realities" compress into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high in the opening paragraph. However, template cadence appears in the ghost's exposition ("Before they came for me" / "About why they burned" / "About why they burned") and summary-only beats flatten key moments—"Marcus documented the photographs" compresses what should be a discovery beat. The phrase "weightless burden" recurs without developing new meaning. Minor filter-verb stacking ("Marcus followed her gesture, his skillfully observant nature catching") dulls immediacy in a key observation moment. No loops or paraphrase cycles, but momentum sags during the ghost's backstory dump.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled. Information density is high; most lines advance concept or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "The sound that emerged wasn't heard so much as felt—a rustling awakening" uses a stock construction. The final paragraph stacks declarations—"multiplied and vanished," "got lost and found themselves," "singing its iron song, printing possibilities"—in a drumbeat pattern that risks overwriting. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but the closure beat's density slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. Two friction points: the opening metaphor "frozen tear" and later "burnished sorrow" edge toward stock elevated diction without fresh embodiment. Line "They had not been human at all" functions as a beat reveal but the short declarative after dense description feels artificially weighted for effect. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion remains steady through reflection-heavy passages. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("temporal storms," "visible river of moments," "copper and gold streams") clusters without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied with strong images: "silver swan with garnets for eyes," "dandelion seed," "dawn breaking." Information density is high. However, multiple lines loop conceptually without adding pressure: "bereft" is named, then "mending what isn't torn" restates it, then "restoring the invisible covenant" paraphrases again. The peak restoration beat summarizes "Box by box" rather than dramatizing one struggle. Figurative language ("cathedral song," "gossamer filaments," "celestial music") stacks densely in the middle third without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template stems: "He [verb]" structures appear in the final paragraph ("He climbed," where customers "would arrive," "would illuminate"). Combined: paraphrase loops −0.3, summary of climax −0.4, figurative density −0.3, template cadence −0.2 = baseline ~7.8 reduced to mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "thirst, limestone dust, the electric anticipation" conveys setting, uncle's state, and compass history in one beat). Minor issues: "She understood why her uncle had come here—this was a place where explanations failed" is a scaffold explaining what the prior image already showed. "Resonant hush" repeats verbatim three times without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "precious and irreducible as the scent of stone tears, as the memory of thirst" recycles the same idea. Small deductions keep it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence variety and rhythm support the contemplative tone, and information density is generally high. However, several lines carry scaffold or near-paraphrase: "That was her perpetual quest too, what kept her learning" immediately restates the prior sentence's idea; "through layered meanings, through patience, through scaffold of simple observations" uses template parallelism without additive pressure; "Complexity scaffolded by simplicity, meanings layered across centuries" in the final paragraph loops thematic vocabulary seen earlier. The phrase "timewoven alliance" appears three times, twice in proximity, risking decorative recurrence. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with longer contemplative sentences and shorter observational beats. Some template cadence appears: "She was a vivid mural artist" / "She was quietly driven" / "She left the pavilion" / "She returned to the amber pavilion"—four sentences opening with "She [verb]" create mild monotony. The phrase "dawning hush of twilight" contains a logical contradiction (dawning=morning, twilight=evening). Information density is generally high with dual-function lines, though the final paragraph overexplains rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong momentum and varied syntax. Information density is high: "letters...yellowed like old teeth" and "Strong hands, darker than hers, arranging fragments" do double work. Minor artifacts cluster in the reflection passages: "understood her motivation clearly now, burning like the desert sun" and "searing focus" repeat intensity without fresh embodiment. The template phrase "Maya felt X, sharp as broken glass" appears alongside "searing" modifiers in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild filter-verb stacking in peak beats. The final paragraph's "cargo of remembrance through endless sky" edges toward purple. These issues do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.7 within the category.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Some lines do double duty: "The town watched silently around her—empty shops with their faded awnings, houses with doors that swung on broken hinges." However, paraphrase loops appear: "not to resurrect what was, but to transmute it into what could be" restates the title's premise. "Not a restoration. A reimagining" repeats the same concept adjacently. Template cadence in the middle third ("She understood now... She carried the bottle... She pressed the bottle") stacks similar stems. Filter-verb reliance ("She understood," "She knew") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for filter stacks touching peak beats; total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("branches skeletal against the violet sky," "hands smelling of ancient bark and older promises"). Information density is high—most lines advance mood, memory, or mystical understanding. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "She had been cataloging emotional patterns embedded in ancient recordings—the tremor of grief, the cadence of joy" is restated two paragraphs later as "she archived emotional patterns...spent her years translating dead languages," and the phrase "why some truths can only be spoken by mistake" closely echoes earlier material without added pressure. The metaphor "fruit-ghosts" recurs but its vehicle remains vague. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the contemplative tone without sluggishness. Minor template cadence: "The tree had been...And now the horn had..." uses parallel structure effectively but borders on mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, several beats carry figurative density without clear payoff: "darker than the void between constellations," "wild serenity," "star-spotted darkness" cluster in quick succession without pattern-teaching. The phrase "furiously tranquil" appears twice as a conceptual frame rather than an embodied state, reading slightly forced. Minor loop: "potential they represented" and "stolen possibilities" restate within two lines. The closing sentence is strong and propulsive, but mid-piece compression would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Syntax varies; information density is high (glue repair, rope vibration, pressure inversion mechanics). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor and charge effectively. Minor deductions: "peculiar hush had settled" and "the air felt charged, expectant" are stock constructions; "credibly curious—that's what the head priest called her, though not always kindly" is a tell-heavy aside that could be cut. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") cluster in the tower sequence but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening period ("perched… like a forgotten prayer") sets a lyric cadence sustained through the piece. Information density is high: the lantern glass does triple duty (tool, motif, thematic vehicle). Two template-cadence artifacts appear in the backstory paragraph ("He'd thought himself broken… he'd discovered something unexpected" adjacent to "His motivation… wasn't about healing… it was about recognizing"), a minor −0.3 penalty. The final image ("carrying its glow inside himself") borders on abstraction but is grounded enough by prior concrete handling of the lantern to avoid a larger deduction. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks; zero line-level opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph structure supports beats, and information density is high (the box description does triple work: anchors mystery, signals craft, establishes color scarcity). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor opacity: "tangled and strange" in "The box was a covenant, tangled and strange" leans abstract where concrete stakes would sharpen. "Mute eloquence" and "tranquil perception" recur slightly more than needed, though they remain voice-motivated. Propulsion is steady; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Opening and closing lines are imagistic and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "numbers still meant something" / "numbers dissolved into abstraction" / "numbers have finally failed" restates the same premise across beats. Stock phrases recur: "weight of responsibility," "texture of time," "heartbeat underneath everything." Template cadence in mid-section: "Marcus [verb], [gerund]" pattern runs across three consecutive sentences. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "Heavy as three summer storms" and "smooth as the moment before sleep" are poetic but lack concrete anchors. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during the kite snap, longer reflection in Maya's notebook explanation. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The prose compresses transit efficiently ("walked closer," "settled onto a smooth stone") and dramatizes key beats fully. Figurative language ("red prayer of release," "woven dawns") is purposeful and voice-consistent, never stacking into purple density. One minor note: "warmly attentive to the discord she sensed in him" uses a filter construction that slightly distances, though it remains voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most lines advance understanding, action, or atmosphere without padding. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. The copper-wire sequence is concrete and propulsive. Minor deductions: "bones within bones" and "roots that remember" are atmospheric but slightly vague; "methodical grace" and "seamlessly integrated" edge toward stock phrasing. The final diary entry risks thematic summary but earns its place by reweighting prior material. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high in the formulae-discovery beat. The opening anchor ("rainwashed," "darkened by morning's downpour") grounds efficiently. However, the piece carries minor loops: "homecoming as a chemical process. Not metaphor—actual chemistry" restates without added pressure, and "converge/convergence" appears five times with decorative rather than escalating function. The final paragraph's "which version of yourself you'd been traveling toward all along" abstracts rather than trusts the prior image. Filter verbs ("feeling its weight," "felt something crack") occasionally dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("narrow vastness," "twilight stained the horizon purple"). Information density is high in botanical and linguistic detail. However, two adjacent sentences in the opening third paraphrase the obsolescence of coaches ("No one hired coaches anymore" / "he had driven passengers between words"), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Figurative language occasionally clusters ("oracle bones," "keyhole that opens onto an ocean") without muddle, but the accumulation slightly thickens texture in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively across beats; the leaf-decoding sequence tightens syntax while the reunion slows to accommodate reflection. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in the war-backstory paragraph ("tracked bodies through rubble and ash, her intuition reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture")—the final clause feels like prompt-element insertion rather than organic voice. The phrase "wild hush" recurs three times, charged with meaning each time, so no loop penalty. Sentence openings vary. One clarity slip: "translate the distance between them into something closer" in the penultimate paragraph paraphrases the motivation already stated, adding −0.2 for near-redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (frozen supernova, time-lapse film, cosmic clock) is coherent and POV-appropriate. Minor: "Days passed, or perhaps weeks—duration meant nothing here" is a small scaffold phrase, but it serves the temporal-stretch premise. One run of "She sketched…She drew…She began" in mid-story compresses without adding pressure, costing ~−0.2. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph's stacked clauses ("to witness…to map…finding her way") create purposeful rhythm without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages slip into ornamental phrasing that stalls momentum. "The wind screamed secrets she couldn't quite hear" is generic mystery-speak. "Sacredly playful" appears three times as a label without sufficient dramatization. Minor paraphrase loops: "twelve pieces… each one hollow, each one containing" and later "piece by piece" recycles structure. The metaphor "old bruises" for sky color is apt, but "wrongness" is vague. Figurative density in the opening third risks over-writing without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 per the non-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the chessboard and method-building passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Strong line: "The absence glowed in her mind" sets up the revelation economically. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph: "luminous absence" returns as charged motif but "unbind us from forgetting" and "quiet gestures that unbind" create a near-synonym loop within four lines, reducing sharpness at closure (−0.3). The phrase "small gestures refused to die. They walked themselves into permanence" also edges toward metaphor stack without full clarity. Grammar and sequencing are clean; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or theme. However, several scaffold patterns appear: "The mercury-glass seer had wandered… ever since remembering became painful" front-loads exposition rather than anchoring in immediate scene, and "But the fiction never satisfied" / "But seeds… were meant to travel" repeats the contrastive opener. "This was her home's language. Her people had shaped meaning…" loops the concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. The metaphor "buried talents rising like water from a forgotten well" stacks vehicles (buried/rising, talents/water, forgotten/well) in ways that blur rather than sharpen. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the score in the solid band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "Once, she had tutored...her exile had been immediate, absolute" compresses backstory economically. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective and purposeful ("amber silence," "platinum labyrinth," "woven hush"). Minor overwriting in the final third: "the woven hush of forgiveness that makes all other conversations possible" and "the language that exists between heartbeats" add slight metaphorical density without advancing action at peak closure. Clarity remains intact and propulsion holds through the decoding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift with emotional intensity. High information density: "towers of bone rose like broken fingers" anchors setting, tone, and metaphor in one image. Minor scaffold: "She had come here not to hide, but to prepare" could be cut without loss. The phrase "innocently mischievous act, she'd told herself" reads as mild filter cushioning that slightly blunts the self-deception beat. "Forged hush...hammered into shape" is strong figurative work at closure. No loops orTemplate cadence runs; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the final crisis accelerates with shorter clauses while reflection moments breathe. Some ornamental phrasing appears: "joy from a wedding celebration interrupted by plague" lists rather than dramatizes, and "between breaths held underwater, between living and drowning, between meaning and void" stacks poetic parallels at a peak beat, adding slight density without advancing clarity. Information density is generally high. Minor paraphrase loop: "Each depression was a template, a mold for specific emotional weight" restates the map realization. No major scaffold or template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies well; opening and closing images bookend cleanly (mirror's fractured angles → seeing clearly). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor loop: "The promise she'd made wasn't to Thomas—not really" then "At nineteen, painting that shell, she'd promised herself" restates across two beats without added pressure. Stock phrase: "yawned ahead" for cave entrance. Filter verbs ("she'd meant to leave," "she understood") occasionally dull immediacy but remain voice-appropriate. Figurative language (mineral sculptures, light-shaft glow) is controlled and legible. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor artifacts: "vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," "screaming tenderness" are abstract labels in high-pressure beats rather than concrete images. The phrase "calcified into stone" and "fury that dressed itself up as rage" are near-paraphrases. The final paragraph's "Whispers, Mara thought, remembering Silas's words" is a slight echo of the already-landed theme. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality, but figurative density in the vial sequence approaches overwriting without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and free of scaffold or loops. Figurative language is purposeful: "starlit signal station perched on its cliff like a broken lighthouse," "moon hung thin as a fingernail scraping the sky." Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor template cadence in the phone-call sequence ("Good," Mara said / "Touch it," Mara said) is brief and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops, no register drift into corporate diction, no grammar errors. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentences anchor, then tighten at the eye-press beat. Information density is high: "the virus had left her involuntarily truthful" does double work (backstory + motive). One template-cadence run: "She felt her fear... She felt her own heart" in the penultimate paragraph (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. The "fractured grace" motif recurs without redundancy, reweighted at closure. Clarity and propulsion hold; the piece reads aloud cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high: "that liminal hour when sea and sky merged" establishes time and atmosphere economically. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (memories "like waves wearing down stone") stays coherent. Minor scaffold detected: "The borrowed memories would die with the flower, and perhaps that was the point" verges on thematic summary. The closing "cutting softly, persistently through the gathering dark" balances literal and emotional registers cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The creek's roar seemed distant now, muffled by stone and earth"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. However, the opening contains light scaffold: "conversations with customers felt like performances in a language he'd nearly forgotten" could be cut without loss. The phrase "a lingering promise unfulfilled" appears twice (title concept and narrator summary), creating slight paraphrase loop. The final paragraph cycles through decision framing ("He could return...Or he could honor") in a way that reads purposeful but edges toward redundancy. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("blade of stone cutting through morning mist," "wounds across the sky"). Sentence rhythm varies appropriately. Minor issues: "This mystery belonged to her alone" and "Disenchantment had settled into her bones like winter cold" feel slightly stock. The phrase "shared silence, and then, with a shared exhale" in the firefly moment uses "shared" twice in close proximity. Information density is high, and the climb sequence propels efficiently without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. However, scaffold patterns appear: "This was" opens two paragraphs in close succession, and "the weight of" recurs three times ("weight of moments," "weight of being," implied in "density"). Some figurative language clusters without full payoff: "swirled...like lazy stars," "settled...like falling ash," and the extended "spiral inward and outward" metaphor in the final paragraphs. The phrase "directed spontaneity" in the penultimate paragraph feels like a conceptual label rather than embodied action. Propulsion remains strong through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high (nearly every line advances character or atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: "tangled fishing line," "origami," "feral nostalgia." A few near-synonyms appear ("shattered," "fragmented," "chronologically confused") but each serves a distinct nuance. Minor deduction: one scaffold-like moment in the middle third where "small impossibilities accumulated" feels slightly summary rather than showing accumulation through fresh detail. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, and the final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the shop description and dialogue. Two friction points: (1) Paraphrase loop in the aromatherapy theater paragraph—"she could still blend" / "she had learned to read" restates her adaptation twice without added pressure (−0.2). (2) The final paragraph over-explains theme ("not as a burden of memory, but as proof that broken things could still measure time, still mark the precious moments, still matter") with stacked clauses that summarize rather than trust the image (−0.4). No template cadence or generation artifacts. Propulsion is steady but the ending loses concision.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor issues: "peculiar and specific" is redundant modifier stacking; "the way their own breath wanted to escape but couldn't" uses a stock breathlessness construction; "hard-won truth" is a near-cliché closing phrase. The loop "crystallization wasn't a flaw. It was preservation" then "ice is water waiting to transform. Fear could become something else" restates the same insight across adjacent beats without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, and artifacts do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual variety. Information density is high—most lines advance character, mood, or stakes. Two minor issues: "suspended moment before irreversible change" and "the hush deepened" are near-paraphrases of the same atmospheric state (paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2). The metaphor density in the opening and closing paragraphs (paper ghosts, frozen prayers, invisible symphonies, paper cathedral) approaches saturation without full pattern-teaching, though it does not obscure causality (−0.3 for density in non-peak descriptive beats).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high and rhythm varies naturally; no grammar or continuity errors. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "journeying inward while walking out" is restated as "deeper into the library and deeper into himself," then again as "simultaneously deeper into the library and deeper into himself." The opening's "wanderingly exact" is elegant, but later lines rely on stock spiritual diction ("provisional truths," "eternal present," "cosmic illusion") without fresh imagery. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job (reflection) without advancing action. Figurative language is coherent but dense in reflective passages without pattern-teaching, nearing overwriting in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is purposeful ("line so precise it could split reality," "human need to contain infinity within numbered boxes"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or philosophical stakes. Clarity is strong; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor loop: "Clocks did not measure time's passage. They measured attention" repeats the core claim in adjacent sentences without added pressure. "Understanding finally" and "she understood" are scaffold phrases that dull immediacy at the climax. Sentence openings vary well, though participial openers ("watching," "squinting") appear in clusters. No major artifact debt, but the closure beat could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary naturally, and rhythm modulates with emotional beats (short, decisive at the syllabus; longer, contemplative at the ending). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful (mica pane, clover as prisms, "prisoner/jailer"). Minor: "living contradiction so lucid it hurt to contemplate" edges toward telling; "traversing the notebooks" and "traversing the same territories" repeat the verb within close proximity. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with vivid images: "prismatic shadows," "copper thread of hello," "waters seeds." No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs mar the flow. However, passages like "collector of estrangements both deliberate and accidental" and "architect of impossible reconnections" lean toward thesaurus elevation without adding density. The phrase "cultivated estrangement as both art and service" is stated twice, verging on scaffold. Information density is moderate; several summary blocks compress action that would benefit from scene. No major artifacts obscure causality, but the line-level work does not reach the high compression or propulsion of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; the walnut-ink recipe and the jetty's history both advance character and theme. However, minor loops appear: "small moments" recurs four times across the piece without accumulating new pressure each time, and "gently thorough" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "contextualized changed" (paragraph five) reads like a typo for "context changed." Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the logistics beats. Minor loop: "The beautiful anarchy of it—polite, structured, yet completely subverting every official channel" restates what prior action already showed. "Cathedral of controlled chaos" and "crept through cracked windows like curious parishioners" stack metaphors in the opener without later payoff. Sentence-level propulsion is strong in dialogue exchanges but slows in reflective blocks ("This stranger had just named the thing she'd been trying to fix"). No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character state, spatial position, or stake. The opening grounds voice and the final image reconfigures prior motifs cleanly. However, multiple abstract doublets ("syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting" / "not a place but a moment, not an absence but a presence" / "love for her wife and her grief for her wife") create a mild template-cadence effect across the piece, reducing propulsive variety in peak beats. One paraphrase near the end: "no map through grief, no chart that could contain it" restates the unmappability claim without adding pressure. These patterns lower Q7 but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language serves purpose. Information density is high in the pen-discovery and signal-revision beats. Two clusters of artifacts lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph 8—"She began to unbend her thinking" immediately follows "unbend reality's rigid spine," restating the concept. (2) Template cadence in paragraphs 10–11: "In one... In another... In a third..." runs three identical stems without tension. The final paragraph stacks "strange comfort," "confidently uncertain," and "dried-up fountain pen wrote nothing, yet... revised everything" as thematic summaries rather than images under pressure. No filter-verb stacks or egregious opacity, so penalty remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the harbor-observation sequence where each image advances Marina's realization. Two friction points: "timeframe in her life" (line 7) is awkward phrasing, and the phrase "joyful sorrow" appears identically in paragraph 3 and the final paragraph, creating a minor template echo. The closing lines accumulate some abstraction—"courage to listen differently," "hands that refused to be still"—that dilutes the concrete momentum built earlier. Figurative language is generally apt (pearls of moonlight, waves as symphony), though "adagio" in paragraph 9 feels imported rather than earned by Marina's vocabulary. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but the final paragraph's stacked dependent clauses slightly blur propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is generally strong, but several artifacts weaken momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "The fires had been necessary" is restated across multiple sentences explaining the poisoned donations. Template cadence in the middle section: "She found X… She worked through Y… She had it…" creates a procedural rhythm that dulls urgency. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("volcanic tenderness," "avalanche of accessible lies," "flames of institutional erasure"). Filter-verb stacks ("she found," "she knew," "she suspected") appear in the discovery sequence. The final image ("promises burn too bright to extinguish") is evocative but borders on cliché. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty, but the two-year search summary adds little pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery and varied syntax, but several artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "The garden existed only for patients like her—experimental treatment guinea pigs" immediately followed by detailed explanation of what we just learned. Template cadence in paragraph four: "remembered being five and eighty-three simultaneously, remembered a first kiss... remembered learning to walk and learning to use a walker" stacks three identical stems without tension. The phrase "auric lagoon" appears five times, crossing from motif into repetitive anchor. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph seven ("she felt them all with her") during a peak beat. These accumulate to −1.2 total within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or plot. The opening hooks cleanly ("geomagnetic storm… violet and green… alien light"), and the final paragraph reprises maps and storm-light with purpose. However, a handful of template cadences appear: "She'd worked… She'd been leaving… she'd been tracking… She'd proven." The phrase "whispers traveled farther than shouts" is stated twice (once in reflection, once in closure thought), creating a minor loop. The metaphor "pathways blooming and collapsing like origami" is vivid, but "infinite configurations" and "endless dance" edge toward stock. No major artifacts obscure causality, and the chase sequence is propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; paragraph lengths create visual flow. However, several repeated stems and near-paraphrases appear: "He didn't greet her" → "Instead, he reached"; "Then his hands began to move" adjacent to "He began to weave patterns"; "stars—or the idea of stars—pinpricks of light" → "creating constellations with their windows." The phrase "spiralingly calm" recurs in both the opening and close without evolving. Figurative density is high in non-peak beats (fragments of twilight like scattered coins, stillwater tension, architecture of light) but remains mostly coherent. Proofreading is clean; no loops severe enough to obscure causality, but synonym churn and template cadence in the middle third apply −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled (no mixed metaphors or purple prose). Minor issues: "hush where past meets prophecy" is elevated but earned by context; "amplified quiet" recurs purposefully. Some phrases verge on stock ("mist pressed against windows like unspoken questions"), and the phrase "forests of second thoughts" is poetic but slightly abstract for the stakes. No loops, scaffolding, or template cadence detected. Propulsion is steady through both reflective and scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and images are specific: "anemones bloomed like fists waiting to open," "kelp sliding against her calves." Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. One paraphrase loop appears: the "guarded heart" and "heart locked behind iron gates" restate the same metaphor across two beats without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. The line "the furious love she still felt, the tender rage of having no one left to fight for or against" stacks near-synonyms ("furious love," "tender rage") in a way that blurs rather than sharpens, costing another −0.3 for figurative muddle. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with no template cadence or major loops.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during narration ("Just reducing.") contrast with longer, lyric passages anchored in perception. Information density is high; most lines advance character (whittling as grief work), atmosphere (turbine hum), or theme (lightness/weight). Minor scaffold: "The turbines groaned" and "The turbines didn't care. They kept spinning" are near-paraphrases of earlier turbine descriptions, creating slight conceptual redundancy. The opening line ("blades carving silence into smaller, more precise silences") and closing spatial image ("stood in their shadow, lighter now") bookend effectively. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats; the voice crack and bouquet disintegration are rendered concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and sensory specificity ("cobalt atrium," "quartz colonnade," "lantern-moth hush"). Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or internal progression. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the ban/lifting context is restated across multiple paragraphs; "boundaries" and "dissolving/permeable" recur without added pressure; and the "tremor of certainty" phrase is repeated verbatim. Template cadence appears in the backstory section ("had been," "had found," "had been"). Figurative density is high throughout ("winter breath," "cloud-shadow," "silk," "first ice," "fractured silver") without clear pattern-teaching, bordering on overwriting in a lyric mode that doesn't fully earn its ornament through constraint or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "Being colorblind had taught her to find beauty in texture, shadow, and form—in the imperfections others overlooked" restates the premise already shown through her actions. "Your perfection is a cage" and the subsequent dialogue ("I've spent my life eliminating every imperfection") echo each other. Template stems appear: "She'd help them see differently... She was innocently cunning... She'd positioned each element..." Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed metaphor: "scatter ash and renewal" treats renewal as a tangible substance. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the demonstration beat: "layering the corrupted fragments...church bell's echo, children's voices in an empty school, wind through a factory's broken windows" does multiple jobs (action, sensory detail, thematic texture). Two minor slips: "They worked through the night" summarizes the pivotal reconstruction rather than dramatizing key choices within it (−0.3). The phrase "Each fragment they restored wasn't cleaned of its corruption but honored for what the silence had made of it" edges toward authorial summary rather than showing the honor in action (−0.2). No loops or template cadence. Figurative language remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across the craft beats. Minor scaffold appears: "After Vincent's death, after the creditors, after waking on her sister's couch" is clean parallelism, but "genuinely artificial" and "honestly artificial" repeat the oxymoron without reweighting it. The phrase "curtains of intention—how people hung barriers" paraphrases itself across the dash. No loops obscure causality, and the figurative load (cherry blossoms as resurrection, stars as language) remains coherent. Line-level clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean with strong specificity: "onyx ink," "spidery handwriting," "measuring tape...worn soft from constant use." Rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor friction: "compelled by an urge she'd resisted for months" tells motivation that could be shown through hesitation or body language, and "the inherited mystery" phrase in Mira's direct speech leans slightly expository. Opening and closing images (rain on skylight) frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, knowledge, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, though some paragraph-length exposition risks momentum drag in the middle third. Minor template cadence in the discovery sequence ("The pagoda rose... The pagoda's entrance... The console's instructions...") but not pervasive. No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks. "Anguished joy" recurs as a phrase without fresh embodiment. Clarity is strong; no causality obscured by line-level artifacts. The closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("shadow unbound from despair," "breathing cotton"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, two paraphrase loops reduce momentum: "preserve the shape of hope" is restated as "preserve...without confronting what hope required" within two lines, and "flowers that never died because they'd never truly lived" echoes "flowers that had forgotten how to wilt" without added pressure. Template cadence in the Lyssa-comparison paragraphs ("same chair, same procedure, same electrodes") is intentional parallelism but borders on mechanical. Apply −0.4 for loops.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high in the middle third (Adrian's fraud enumerated, animal inventory, report drafting). Minor issues: "shimmering" recurs four times, risking synonym fatigue; "quietly vivid" appears twice in identical phrasing. The opening and closing images are strong, but "felt something settle in her chest" is a stock interiority marker. No loops or causality-obscuring artifacts touch the closure beat. Clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. "The anesthesia wore off slowly, leaving Maya suspended between dreaming and dawn" opens strongly. Information density is high in the coffee-ring examination beat. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "opening wounds she'd rather leave sealed" echoes "seeking closure" without adding pressure, and "both acts were rooted in care. Both mattered" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences. The "stories written in flesh were never just about closing" penultimate paragraph summary slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "incubate in the dark like seeds waiting for impossible spring" and "shaking her at frequencies below sound" in the same narrative window create figurative density without progressive revelation. The phrase "finally, finally" repeats across two paragraphs (once in paragraph six, again in the finale), a paraphrase loop that blunts urgency. "Hushed, holy, and finally, finally seen" in the last line stacks modifiers and echoes prior phrasing. Sentence openings vary and no major template cadence appears, but the figurative load in high-pressure beats (projection scene) reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence lengths modulate with rising tension. Minor overwriting appears in metaphor density: "ribbons that wrote languages," "shadows...with fingers of darkness and ecstasy," "light made flesh through the dreaming" cluster without clear payoff. Stock phrasing surfaces in "whispered with her final breath" and "brave enough to listen." One paraphrase loop: "unspoken words" / "unexpressed creativity" / "unuttered word" recur without added pressure. The closure beat avoids major artifacts, but mid-story figurative saturation costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines do double work (world-building + character state). Minor scaffold appears: "What mattered was the resonance" feels slightly explanatory, and "her motivation had become singular" tells rather than embodies. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language (amber specimen, quantum foam, probability fields) remains coherent and legible throughout, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: "each one clicking softly in the wind," "roots made of interlocking gears that pulsed with slow, deliberate rhythm," and "willow-thoughts flexible and quick, pine-thoughts sharp and resinous with old trauma" deliver high information density with purposeful rhythm. A few artifacts diminish momentum: "He had been a professor once, before the awakening—before his students called him mad" front-loads backstory without immediate pressure, and "To understand this place, he needed to unravel it. Not destroy, but carefully trace each connection back to its source" loops the unraveling concept across adjacent lines. No paraphrase loops in peak beats, and the closing wind-song whisper lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies and sentences propel without stalling; openings and lengths shift. Information density is high in the station beats. Two paraphrase loops appear: "courage never left" / "It waited here" and the triple simile closing line ("like a map, like a promise, like the first line"), which reads intentional but borders on template cadence. No filter-verb stacks, no major clarity loss. Figurative language is dense (fog, stars, tides, leash, veils) without obscuring the narrative spine; the overwriting threshold is approached but not crossed in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph structure supports beats. Minor template cadence appears in the opening exposition ("Then came the avalanche. Twenty-three students buried. Twenty-three voices extinguished") but the parallelism reads purposeful and does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn touch the closure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "remain" and "sing" with cost. A slight register elevation ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable") fits the lyric-textural mode without violating POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates appropriately as the library dissolves ("She had perhaps three more cycles…"). Grammar and pronoun references are clean. Two issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop—"The diminutive titan had tended" and "She stood barely three feet tall" restate her size across adjacent beats without added pressure; (2) elevated diction in peak beats ("temporal mathematics," "sunder the lies") is voice-consistent but borders on explaining the premise rather than trusting image. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks beyond the single instance noted in Q6. Clarity at closure is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances data interpretation, character thought, or thematic layering. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and the three-two rhythm is woven through action and perception without becoming mechanical. Minor scaffolding appears in phrases like "The atlas page lay on her desk, torn deliberately" where "torn deliberately" feels slightly over-explained. One paraphrase loop: "The paths aren't disappearing… They're shifting" followed immediately by "what if the paths aren't disappearing? What if they're returning?" restates the insight without adding pressure. Overall propulsion is strong, figurative language is controlled, and no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or thematic charge. Minor scaffold: "awkwardly confident" repeated verbatim in final paragraph; "hum" appears frequently but functionally distinct each time. "Thunderous serenity" and "margin of daylight" recur purposefully to charge closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language (ribcages, smoke, tuning fork) stays coherent and serves the accumulative design. Propulsion steady through twilight to night transition.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive. Strong images: "roots clutched volcanic rock," "steam rendered everything dreamlike," "pulsed with bioluminescence." Sentence rhythm varies and supports scene urgency. However, minor template cadence in the middle section: "The bamboo showed her... The moss revealed... The reeds whispered..." runs three parallel constructions without payoff. The phrase "gardening futures, tending an implanted destiny toward harvest" layers metaphors that blur slightly. No loops or major scaffolding, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally with stress (short bursts during the helicopter trigger, longer syntax in the propagation tasks). Minor loop: "It was enough. It had to be. And some days, like today, it almost was" is intentional cadence but borders repetition without added detail. One filter-verb cluster ("begin to ease," "formed slowly") in the recovery beat slightly dulls immediacy. No clarity breaks; the prose propels cleanly to closure with concrete images anchoring each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with strong images: "cards scattered like fallen teeth," "lighthouse contracting around her like a closing fist." However, several artifacts accumulate: "necessary darkness" and "necessary breaking" repeat the modifier; "redesign" appears in three contexts without clear distinction; "luminescent ache" in the antepenultimate paragraph feels forced. The rhetorical questions stack in the middle section without always advancing pressure. Rhythm varies well, but figurative density is high in spots without always serving urgency. Information density is good overall.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery or deepen motivation. The opening paragraph efficiently anchors setting, character trait (pink eyes), and stakes (someone disappeared). Minor scaffold appears in "That day, time had slowed" transitioning to backstory, but it's anchored and brief. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("anger was a still lake," "consciousness...touching something") is coherent and pressure-driven. Propulsion is strong through the alcove discovery to the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong; the opening line ("frozen inside a meteorite fragment") anchors immediately. Information density is high: most lines advance both setting and stakes. However, three minor artifacts: "Within the blink that follows surprise, everything changed" is a scaffold phrase that summarizes rather than enacts the pivot; "The dangerous liaison letter had done its work" is a paraphrase of the prior paragraph's effect; and "echoing library" recurs four times without pattern-teaching or evolving meaning. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Clarity is strong overall. Two deductions: "That particular quality of fierce peace she'd created here" is over-explained where "tranquil blaze" already carried the effect (−0.3 for minor scaffold). "Harvested" as metaphor for killing is apt but "what you want to grow instead of what you've harvested" risks slight on-the-nose thematic phrasing in a high-stakes beat (−0.2). No loops or template cadence; figurative language is generally controlled. Sentence openings vary well.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high density ("She cupped her hands around the sound, feeling it translate her desperation into something that pulsed with possibility"). Minimal scaffold. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges prior material (constellations, singing daughter). One cluster of adjacent figurative constructions in the middle third ("emotions swam too fast," "frequencies that erased," "garden shuddered") approaches density ceiling but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character or plot. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several prose patterns recur: "Adelaide + verb" sentence stems appear frequently, and some metaphoric density in the opening ("realm beyond consequence," "echoing dome," "orbits of regret") frontloads texture before pressure peaks. The phrase "devotedly observant" appears twice in similar constructions (lines about stars and photographs), creating minor synonym churn. "Solemn" appears three times in similar emotional contexts. No major loops, but the figurative load in reflective passages occasionally slows momentum before the confrontation with Marcus.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense ("memories the way amber holds ancient insects," "temporal sensors flickered") and occasionally stacks without progression. The phrase "meteor hush of 2 a.m." recurs without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "untranslatable, untetherable" and "dissonance… harmonize what cannot be changed" restate the same idea adjacently. Rhythm varies and information density is high, but filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she understood," "she had never questioned"). The final paragraph elevates into thesis-like phrasing that abstracts the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is vivid without clutter: "limestone walls curved into natural parabolas," "the mist thickened." Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or symbolic resonance. However, several phrases approach overwriting: "multiplying into whispers," "the mess was the message," and "mist finding a new shape" stack figurative language in the closure beat without full coherence. The final paragraph summarizes the emotional payoff ("their breathing synchronized, amplified, became a rhythm") where a sharper image would have landed harder. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Opening and closing images are charged and specific. Minor overwriting appears in the reflection: "another weight in her steel hands" and "Perhaps that was the burden" deliver the theme a bit directly. One paraphrase loop: the "shattered sky" recurs four times with similar descriptive function, though the final recurrence reweights it successfully. Information density is high in the retrocognitive sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is selective: "amber-warm triumph, blue-cold regret, green-bright resilience." Information density is high in the orchard sequence, where image and action advance simultaneously. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Tonight, she'd sensed someone...A young man...had stood outside...His despair had tasted..." restates the same observation across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the vision sequence: "She saw him find...saw his hands...She tasted his recognition," stacking "saw/tasted" constructions. The final paragraph—"Perhaps this time, someone would recognize...Perhaps this time, the encore she sought"—cycles "perhaps this time" without causal progression. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ending image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high throughout. The opening beat economically establishes backstory, relationship, and conflict. However, the three-week montage suffers from summary compression: "For three weeks, they worked" followed by process description lacks the propulsive particularity of surrounding beats. Minor template cadence in the Dr. Chen section: "It's not telepathy...It's better. It's a lexicon" / "Not telepathy, but something..." recycles the same rhetorical frame. The somatic-marker catalog (curiosity spirals clockwise, fear fractures, love blooms) edges toward ornamental listing. No major loops or scaffold, but these mid-story artifacts prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths shift with Mira's movements. Information density is high in the opening third (cave, mapping, Dormancy, technology) but the middle and closing thirds loop thematically: "speak for them," "translate mystery into meaning," "map it all" recycle the same concept across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in "The unknown would not remain voiceless. She would witness…she would map it all"—three stacked declaratives with identical subject-verb stems at closure. Figurative language is controlled (tidal breathing, green-black water) but "factually mystical" as a repeated phrase feels like scaffold. No major clarity breaks, but the loops and stems dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level clarity is strong with good information density and rhythmic variety. However, mild scaffold appears: "This one: resignation… This one: hope… This one: rebellion" is a three-beat anaphora that reads purposeful but borders on template cadence. The phrase "unearthed silence" recurs twice without added meaning, and "the warehouse… hummed with unearthed silence, its secrets finally given voice, its scattered wisdom made whole and shared" in the final paragraph stacks three near-synonymous clauses. These issues are confined to non-closure beats and do not obscure causality, so the penalty remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the first half (handler assassination, network compromise, weather station cover, pillbox coordinates). No major loops or scaffold. Two craft issues: the phrase "unused courage had been waiting here all along, patient as snowfall, persistent as wind" is repeated verbatim at the end, creating a bookend effect that reads as intentional but borders on summary; and "silver hush" recurs three times without evolving meaning, edging toward decorative recurrence. The barometric-pressure encoding is mentioned but not shown in concrete action, a missed opportunity for tactile specificity at a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; no scaffold loops or paraphrase cycles detected. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor frictions: "closely attentive" in the second sentence feels slightly elevated for the POV at that moment, and "meanings nested within meanings" borders on abstract phrasing during a high-texture beat. The phrase "sometimes the answer wasn't in adding more words" in the penultimate section reads as light authorial tilt rather than strict POV thought. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance understanding or action. Two frictions: "fractured timelines layered like geological strata" and "thrummed at its own frequency" lean toward stock metaphor without fresh specificity. Minor paraphrase loop: "the oasis grew toward care itself, not mere light" and later "phototropic to kindness" restate the same insight. The final paragraph's "walked differently now" and "understanding that her pottery, too, would resist time" could be tighter. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so accumulation cap applies: −0.4 total.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening (rose, grandmother, diagnosis, locksmith trade, brass tooth). Clarity is strong; no loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "The building behind her held its breath—or perhaps she did" is a hedged metaphor that dilutes rather than sharpens. "Protected vulnerability" and "quivering hush" appear as label-insertions rather than emerging from embodied perception. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent, though "vulnerable to the tides" inside the boathouse slightly strains spatial logic (the text implies tides threaten the structure, yet the children wait safely inside).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "Each day brought...that her old skills...that the books shifted...that time moved" and parallel "The hum was navigation, warning, and welcome." The phrase "brittle awakenings" recurs three times without evolving meaning until the final deployment. Figurative language is dense (fractures sharp enough to draw blood, bones breaking to reset, clouds like applause) but occasionally stacks without breathing room in high-concept beats, pushing toward overwriting. Clarity remains intact and no loops obscure causality, keeping this in the serviceable mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and information density is high (the opening efficiently anchors character, profession, and secret archive). Clarity is strong throughout. However, "each one" appears five times in close proximity across the final third, creating a mild template-cadence effect that dulls propulsion. The closing image ("fracturing into a thousand crystalline notes") is vivid but borders on overwriting given the already heavy use of "prismatic" earlier. No loops or scaffold otherwise, and the storm-to-spiral sequence advances cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. Minor template cadence appears in the opening (list of signal effects: "rhythms that felt almost conversational... vibrations that made her teeth ache and her vision blur") but does not obscure causality. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop: "The effect was immediate and strange: the air seemed to thicken, gaining texture" restates without added pressure, triggering −0.2. No figurative muddle in peak beats; the oscilloscope waveforms and constructive interference carry technical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("starlight poured through like silver rain," "spaces that folded into themselves like origami nightmares"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or action. Minor issues: "The architect had discovered something he shouldn't have: that certain places refused..." uses a colon that introduces a nested clause awkwardly, and "the key she sought had been lost three centuries ago when the architect discovered" front-loads backstory mechanically. A few template cadences appear ("She understood now," "Then she heard it") but do not pervade. No loops or major scaffold; figurative language is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the workshop-realization beat. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "a portrait artist cursed with prosopagnosia" and "stone walls rising like silent witnesses" front-load without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loop: "Vera descended" / "The quarry floor materialized" / "Here: where the first victim fell" restates arrival across three beats. Figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching: "lance," "lanced through her," "unified love with a lance" cycles the same vehicle. Template cadence in the masquerade paragraph: "Guests had descended... torches burning... masks transforming." No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "rusted sentinel," "verdigris patina," "sky churned with colors that shouldn't exist." However, several scaffold phrases reduce density—"The pattern had become clear," "the spongey dread... intensified," "perhaps, Mira thought"—and the final paragraph loops thematic summary ("honoring bravery that had waited too long") rather than trusting the image. Sentence openings vary, but mid-story exposition about the Meridian Papers and shipwrecked journals slows momentum without immediate pressure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor pattern artifacts: "about the woman... / About the names... / About amnesty..." in the penultimate section reads as anaphora but edges toward list structure. "Suffused with luminous disbelief" and "dynamically observant" feel slightly elevated for the POV under stress. The phrase "pixelated amnesty... forgiveness broken into fragments" performs a explain-the-metaphor move mid-discovery that slows momentum. No loops or major scaffolding; clarity and concision are strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure supports beat shifts (short fox paragraph breaks the reflection). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., foreign bills are backstory anchor, thematic object, and tactile present stimulus). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: a handful of near-synonyms cluster without added pressure ("burned bright" / "smoke," "transcendence" / "transformation" / "transmuted" implied by context) and the phrase "claiming it as his kingdom" + "sense of control, of ownership" paraphrases slightly across adjacent beats. The overwriting is light and does not obscure causality, but it slows one mid-paragraph moment. Otherwise clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong images (telegram pressed with daylilies, stars harmonizing, dawn approaching). Information density is high in the collaborative-decoding beat. However, paraphrase loops appear: "some weights grew lighter when held between two pairs of hands" / "shared burdens" / "burdens halved" recycle the same concept across paragraphs. Template cadence in the opening: "Mira had spent," "she was accustomed," "she adjusted." The final paragraph's thematic summary ("wisdom lives not in lonely stars…") reads as scaffold rather than image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines carry redundancy or scaffold: "She had expected failure. Charlatans dealt in surfaces; curses required roots" restates the same idea twice. "The vision struck like a blade" and similar constructions lean on stock metaphor. Filter-verb stack in the final paragraph ("she had won," "she had found") dulls immediacy. The phrase "the lake became still, and in that stillness, finally rested" loops the concept of stillness without adding pressure. No severe loops, but cumulative minor inefficiencies lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    Opening and closing images are strong ("shadows stretching like fingers," "the living intersection of what was, what is, and what must come to be"), anchoring voice and stakes. However, several prose artifacts cluster in mid-story and closure beats: paraphrase loops ("The intersection of dreams" / "Not just dreams anymore" / "intersection of dreams"), template cadence in the Intersection introduction paragraph (woman with X, man whose Y, child whose Z), and elevated register drift ("transcendent purpose," "pure crystallized possibility") that abstracts rather than grounds. The maze-building sequence summarizes key action ("they began to work… their maze began to take shape") rather than dramatizing tactile steps, flattening momentum. Pronoun references remain clear, and no simultaneity errors appear, but the figurative density in the final third ("blazed forth in recognition," "crystallized possibility") risks overwriting without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (roots threading through ribcages, fruit glowing phosphorescent). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing. However, multiple lines carry overwriting: "dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle," "the great web of exchanged futures" pile figurative language without clear necessity. Paraphrase loops appear: "she would try. She would always try" and "wondering if...wondering if" in adjacent lines. The phrase "half-lit corridors" is used in both the opening and near the end without reweighting. Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("even knowing...even knowing") and the ornate register in high-pressure moments (Kael's revelation) slow momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme without padding. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes appropriately (clipped during appraisal, expansive in reflection). Two minor template-cadence instances appear in the backstory paragraph ("After the applause ended, after the lights went dark" / "the empty venues, the long drives, the morning light") but remain voice-motivated and do not dull closure. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The final image is propulsive and image-driven: "pulled another estate box toward him, and began again." Figurative language (echo valley, dust motes, hollow quarry) is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with strong images (clouds "like thoughts trying to form words," leaves "unfurling like cuneiform wedges"). Two patterns flatten momentum: paraphrase loops in the reflection-heavy middle ("Those same ambitions now haunted Asha" echoes "His ambitions had haunted him" within two paragraphs; "physics of transition" recurs six times without reweighting). Template cadence in the climax: "She understood then," "She had bridged," "she finally touched" stack explanation where image could carry the work. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed ("roots in clay, branches in starlight" works; "touching distance to understanding" as both metaphor and closing phrase feels forced). No major artifacts touch the closure image directly, but scaffold phrasing lowers information density in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (tidal atrium "breathed," knowledge "transforms through being known") charges key images. Information density is high in the smelting sequence. However, several beats loop conceptually: the idea that wonder requires change is stated in the founder's pages, then restated by the scroll, then paraphrased in Maren's realization and again in the closing paragraph—four iterations of the same insight without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final lines ("already planning...already forgetting...already"). The phrase "wintersun serenity" recurs three times as a label without evolving meaning. Filter-verb density ("understood," "felt," "discovered") in reflective passages dulls immediacy. Subtracting −0.8 for loop and template issues under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or deepen Mara's shift. Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats for the bunker entrance, longer for the confession discovery, compressed again for the final choice. Two minor artifacts: "heartbeat between silence and speech preserved in spiral form" (metaphor stacks without clear vehicle), and "clicking gently in her hands" (generic embodiment). Paragraph four uses "realize/understood/became clear" in quick succession, creating mild paraphrase drift (-0.2). The "contagion of courage" phrase in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the established voice (-0.2). Otherwise clean with strong propulsion and no loops touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("ivy cascading," "green waterfalls frozen in time"). Minor loop: "the truth was" repeated three times in quick succession in the bathroom scene creates mild redundancy. The patched-bellows detail recurs with purpose. Sentence openings vary, and no major scaffold artifacts appear. Clarity and propulsion are strong. The loop deduction is modest (−0.3) because it doesn't obscure causality, and the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and purposeful figurative language: "spectacles that reflected nothing, as if their lenses absorbed light," "veil trailing like smoke." Information density is high in world-building passages. However, the final two paragraphs contain mild template cadence: "She had found it. / The library of unspoken words existed… / Outside, the mist swirled. / Inside, Elena wrote…" and a paraphrase loop ("documenting the impossible" echoes "began to document" three lines prior). Stock metaphors appear: "heart sank, then lifted as understanding bloomed." No major loops or register drift, but closure beats lack propulsive specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-first, prepositional, and participial without template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "ice crystal harvested from the northernmost glacier" anchors object and world rule; "ferns whispered constantly about light and water" establishes telepathy and their simplicity). One paraphrase loop: "preserved by methods its creator had taken to the grave" and "its creator had meant it to be played, not imprisoned" restate the maker's intent across paragraphs without added pressure. Minor figurative muddle: "bruised twilight that never quite resolved into clarity" and "mulberry ache" are lush but verge on ornamental in adjacent beats. No grammatical errors; spatial choreography (display case, corner desk, observatory windows) tracks cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("some things must be scattered to survive") closes with image and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high (each sentence advances ritual or atmosphere), and clarity holds. Opening and closing images anchor well. Overwriting appears in stacked modifiers and figurative density without pattern payoff: "sacred rhythm of the loom," "gossamer-thin," "radiant hush," "luminous fragments," "consecrated winds" cluster without reweighting meaning. Two paraphrase loops: "The emerald chip glowed with soft inner light now, saturated with what she'd gathered" restates the work already shown; "prepared for the next soul" recaps the vigil claim. Deductions: density overload −0.3, loops −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong imagery ("translucent, confused, flickering like candlelight," "scalloped pattern of their past lives"). Rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: "kindly decisive" appears twice in close proximity without added pressure. The metaphor "scallop away the excess barnacles of resentment" is vivid but slightly mixed (scalloping is a cut pattern; barnacles are removed by scraping). A few filter verbs ("watched him witness") dull immediacy slightly in a peak beat. Information density is high; no major scaffolding. Sentence-level propulsion is strong through the confrontation and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong sentence variety and purposeful cadence shifts (short exchanges during confrontation, longer descriptive passages at dawn). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic weight. Opening and closing images (campfire dying/ashes scattering) frame the arc without redundancy. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffold: "sincerely insincere—the practiced warmth of someone who'd learned to smile" over-explains a phrase that could stand alone, and "protected vulnerability, raw and real" stacks near-synonyms.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or meaning. Figurative language (erosion in reverse, sediment layers, rings/crescents) coheres around the central image without muddle. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully. Minor template cadence appears in consecutive "She had wanted…" / "She had been…" constructions mid-story, and "the starlight became less vivid than the shadows it cast" closely echoes the prior line's structure. No paraphrase loops or clarity-obscuring artifacts touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean. The final image propels without summary, though a few filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "realized") reduce immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("folded into itself like prayers spoken in rounds," "coating itself in the dust of countless seasons"). However, several adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The pulse showed her this through the birds' sudden scatter and regroup—the pattern of interruption, of motion arrested. The consciousness had been so focused on the chase that it couldn't conceive of stillness, even in death." This paraphrase loop and the summary-heavy middle section ("She showed it what she had learned through centuries") reduce information density and slightly flatten momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the teaching sequence leans on telling over dramatized embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory anchors ("translucent layers," "water droplets," "muscles burning"). Minor loop/scaffold: "The fit was perfect" is a one-line beat that could integrate with the luminance spread sentence for tighter momentum. The phrase "she had finally passed the only examination that mattered" is near-summary; the prior keystone press and pulse carry the real weight. Figurative language ("light chasing itself," "brilliant dimness") is consistent and controlled, though density is high in the final third without obscuring clarity. No major syntax monotony or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Sky lanterns rose like slow-burning stars, their reflected light dancing across the black water where the *Meridian* had sunk forty years ago" anchors event, setting, and backstory). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor friction: "mnemonic system she'd explained once: 'Every sound needs an address, darling, a room number where it lives'" is functional exposition but slightly scaffolds the hotel-key logic rather than letting it emerge through action. Figurative language (cathedral of rust, meteor hush) is controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or ritual. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The backwards prophecy resolved slowly" is followed by restated content about temporal echoes; "quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt" recurs in two forms without added pressure. Template cadence is light but present in coin-listing constructions. Figurative language (amber silence, stellar doubt, physics stumbling like colts) is evocative but risks overwriting in a compressed space. No severe clarity breaks, but some scaffold persists ("Show me which frequency," she whispered to them, to herself, to whatever might be listening").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "I'm not afraid" motif with earned weight. Information density high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and symbolic structure simultaneously. Minor template cadence in middle section: "She had come/She had found/She understood" stems repeat across four paragraphs, creating slight rhythmic monotony (−0.4). One paraphrase moment: the hollow-place filling is described twice in adjacent paragraphs with different metaphors that don't add new pressure (−0.2). No loops in closure beat; propulsion clean.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in the setup (cosmic balance, dew timing, bell history compressed efficiently). Loops present: "dripping rate" appears six times, three in close succession in one paragraph ("dripping rate of dew matched the dripping rate of memory matched the dripping rate of cosmic balance"), reading as intentional pattern but borderline churn. "Brittle devotion" and "earnestly naive" are label-repeated without fresh dramatization. Figurative language is dense in the climax ("tone that fell upward," "dew weeping upward," "clouds remembered rain") but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold: "She was what the remaining villagers called" and "The elders said...But Maren had noticed" are slightly expository. Apply −0.6 for loops and label repetition touching multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high in the discovery beats. However, several artifact patterns appear: "precisely humane expression" and "precisely humane vigilance" repeat the phrase without functional evolution; "mirrored hush" appears twice as a stock descriptor; the penultimate paragraph's "spin stories into shared meaning" reads like mission-statement diction outside Mara's established voice. The closing sentence stacks three "everything it" clauses in a way that feels rhetorically intentional but slightly over-written for the moment's pressure. Mid-story exposition about the Dutoit family ("she had heard stories") tells rather than shows, though it's brief. No paraphrase loops, but the figurative language clusters ("accusations," "restoration," "spin stories") in the final third without anchoring in immediate sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, though some phrases veer into stock lyricism ("settled over her like snowfall," "struck her like lightning"). Two paraphrase loops appear: "She was secretly sentimental, though she hid it" immediately restates the prior internalization; the penultimate paragraph's summary of "logic and intuition" echoes the orchard realization. Template cadence emerges in the backstory paragraph ("She kept… she told herself… she sometimes sketched"). The climactic flame sequence is crisp, but the final two paragraphs compress momentum with summary ("everything had changed," "the harmonious marriage of head and heart") rather than sustaining propulsion through image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity is strong through most beats. Notable weaknesses: paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("Being attentively inventive had always been her strength—seeing connections others missed, finding meaning in seemingly random arrangements") restates without added pressure. The phrase "soundless echo of truth reverberating through her bones" mixes metaphor (soundless yet reverberating). Template cadence in paragraph seven: "Three steps left, duck beneath the lowhanging bough, reach up to touch the intersection point" reads procedural without pressure modulation. Modest line-level artifacts accumulate but don't obscure closure. Apply −0.8 for two distinct issues (paraphrase + metaphor muddle) per accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with strong imagery (brain pulsing with electric light, forests stuttering into prairies). Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Minor loop detected: "The therapy had worked too well" and the subsequent explanation could compress. The phrase "vivify each other's humanity" and "vivifying its opposite" lean toward elevated abstraction in peak beats, slightly blurring immediacy. One filter-verb cluster in the dojo scene ("watching," "stared at," "looked at") dulls a high-pressure exchange. No major grammatical errors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Overall momentum is strong with minor textural friction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. No major loops or template cadence. Clarity holds across beats. Two distinct artifacts: "something else—an off-key wind" / "something else: a kind of wild joy" repeats the "something else" construction within close proximity, creating mild synonym churn. The closing sentence stacks three abstract nouns ("wind and leaves and impossible, mournful hope") where one concrete image would land harder. Figurative density ("curl around the hearts," "calcified into silence") is elevated but remains legible; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance situation and interiority). The piece avoids major loops, though "she had been/couldn't remember/couldn't recall" in paragraph two shows mild synonym cycling. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("boundaries where illumination met shadow" ties to premise). One metaphor strain: "veil of sleep" as travel mechanism is asserted but never embodied with sensory grounding. Propulsion maintains through accumulative patterning rather than causality, fitting the chosen lens. Minor template cadence appears in "she had stopped" repetitions (paragraph five).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("veins carrying luminous blood," "wooden tendrils unfurling like frost patterns"). However, metaphor density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and some vehicles mix registers: "hope calcified into habit" (geological + behavioral), "glacier...freezing every wild possibility" (extended but stock). Template cadence appears in the failures catalog: "The first attempt...The seventh...The fourteenth." The phrase "the penny finally dropped" is idiomatic but tonally jarring in this high-fantasy register. Information density is strong; propulsion is steady but occasionally slowed by reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("static whispers," "inverse symphony," "cradle suspended between earth and sky"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or understanding. Minor template cadence appears in the discovery sequence: "It wasn't silence...it was the sound" echoed by "They were the same frequency, just tuned..." The final paragraph's "Tomorrow, during the next perigee, she would listen deeper still" adds a forward gesture that slightly dilutes closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences advance situation and atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The ferry shuddered. Mrs. Chen materialized... Mr. Okafor appeared... then Sarah Michaels... then the businessman" uses identical syntactic stems across four beats. Stock metaphors recur: "translucent around the edges, her outline shimmering like heat waves." The phrase "resiliently positive" appears twice identically. Figurative density in the grotto passage (limestone constellations, bioluminescence, parallel timelines) risks overwriting but remains mostly legible. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops per patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantments"). However, mid-story template cadence emerges: "The thread glowed faintly now... The optical illusions were changing too..." and the final paragraph stacks conceptual claims ("texture of a connection," "rational enchantment," "boundary between minds") that blur into abstraction rather than concrete image. No paraphrase loops, but the closure beat's figurative density ("fever dream made flesh," "mapped in sinew and light") slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean with strong information density and purposeful rhythm. Sentences vary in structure and the opening/closing images bracket effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; technical terms are precise and voice-appropriate. Figurative language ("pressed down like history, like forgetting," "darkness was absolute") is controlled and doesn't muddle high-pressure beats. The chain link description recurs with evolving meaning rather than static repetition. Minor issue: "wondering/mystery" and "horizons/unfolding" cluster slightly but don't obscure momentum. Zero artifacts that touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is generally high. However, several phrases carry ornamental weight without advancing pressure: "potted ferns that seemed to lean toward secrets," "reeling hush," "the weight of incidental heroism." The phrase "incidental heroism" appears twice, creating mild redundancy. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd discovered," "she realized") when immediacy would strengthen key beats. The closure image is clean and propulsive, largely untouched by these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or plot. Minor scaffold appears in "The facility seemed to breathe, moving between states: exposed and submerged, air and water, remembered and forgotten"—the list feels slightly mechanical. "Crashing hush, crashing hush" as onomatopoeia works but borders on over-writing. The closing paragraph edge toward summary ("Tomorrow she would return again, gathering piece by piece") rather than image. Overall clean with strong propulsion, but the final beats soften into exposition rather than leaving the codex glow to carry closure alone.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is vivid ("pearl in the throat of winter," "liquid geometry"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase: the opening paragraph describes the observatory, then the second restates "waiting three hours in the midnight darkness, counting heartbeats, waiting for clarity." The reflection on defragmentation and the teacup shard as "bridge" versus "talisman of endings" recycles the same conceptual ground. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. "Ephemeral patterns, fractals blooming and dissolving" and "mathematics of love translated into liquid geometry" stack metaphors in quick succession. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative paraphrase and decorative layering reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each beat advances encoding progress or thematic weight). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("swallowed the old ways like a flood," "crack like a thread"). Minor density slip: "She had studied the problem for years, but the breakthrough came from watching birds" could tighten by embedding the contrast in action rather than summary transition. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong specificity ("flint arrowhead, ancient and precisely knapped," "wind through a canyon, overlaid with human breathing"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The phone mechanism (copper wire, static, electromagnetic spaces) is rendered with tactile clarity. Minor overwriting: "frostbitten hope—the look of someone who'd glimpsed warmth through ice" stacks metaphor without adding clarity, and "tears froze on her cheeks in the garden's strange microclimate" edges toward purple in a high-emotion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through the discovery-play-liberation arc. Minor artifacts cluster: "the gap between knowing and understanding" appears as both title-phrase and summary; "beauty" recurs as an abstract four times without fresh embodiment. "Resonantly soft" is used twice identically. The final paragraph slips into thesis-language ("her purpose: not just to play beauty into existence, but to free it entirely") rather than image. Information density is generally high and no major loops appear, but the elevated register in key beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong verbs ("skimming," "cradling," "reweights"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in the third paragraph's passive construction "the brittle hush...settled" immediately after "owners pulling down metal shutters with practiced silence"—two mood-setting gestures in sequence without advancing action. The phrase "fractured geography of separation" in the penultimate exchange is slightly elevated. Final line "carrying what the borders couldn't stop" provides propulsion and image. No major loops or template cadence; figurative language (cobalt, oceanic shadow, indigo) is controlled and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and clarity holds throughout. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges motifs (wind bells, halo, turning). Figurative language is purposeful ("water from deep stone," "crescents across the train car's walls") and consistent. Minor deductions: slight repetition in "The carousel began to turn" followed by "the carousel turned on" and "It would turn for anyone"; "chiming" recurs frequently in close proximity. Template cadence appears in a few transitions ("She worked… She cleaned… She sang…"), though the parallelism feels intentional and voice-motivated. No loops obscure causality or closure; overall momentum is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high. Two minor issues: the phrase "sanely eccentric" (paragraph 2) is tell rather than show, and "emotional coordinates on translucent sheets" (paragraph 3) mixes metaphor slightly. The final paragraph contains mild overwriting—"the hyperbolic geometry wasn't a method for finding where stories lived; it was the place itself" followed immediately by another restatement. No loops or severe artifacts, but the closure beat could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—nearly every line advances atmosphere or Marina's interior arc. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (honey light, paint-wells as oceans). Deductions: "vitalize" appears three times as a thematic keyword, edging toward prompt-artifact repetition. "Cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" recur as labeled concepts rather than fully embodied images. Template stems appear twice: "She carried… She painted… She was learning…" in adjacent paragraphs. These accumulate to −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "wisps of smoke," "instruments that defied classification," "raw need beneath," "architecture of feeling," "scaffolding on which notes might climb," "constellations finding their shapes in the infinite dark." This clusters in every beat, including the disorientation climax, applying −0.5. Stock metaphor pairs appear: "trembling with improbable longing," "deepening blue," "streaming tears." Template cadence in the reflection beat: "I was afraid... And now?... The device chimed... The walls steadied. Understanding flooded..." reads as stacked filter-verb + declarative summary. Paraphrase loop: "the fear had never protected Clara, only imprisoned the full truth" restates the prior realization without new pressure. Cumulative Q7 deductions: −1.2, and the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is often striking ("moonlight like scattered pearls," "gap in her mind like a missing tooth"). Yet paraphrase loops appear: "chronically curious nature" recurs three times with minimal variation, and "the weight of decades"/"weight of a secret" echo without added pressure. The phrase "decades later" and "forty years ago" and "now" cycle through temporal framing redundantly. Filter verbs ("she'd been," "she'd spent") stack in the backstory paragraphs, dulling immediacy during a reflective stretch that already risks momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative language ("afternoon shadow caught...like amber," "resilience like a lantern") serves image without density overload. Two mild artifacts: "with visible reluctance" and "nervous energy making her retreat" lean slightly tell-y, and "ghostly arc" is a minor stock phrase. Information density high in tea-leaf and shadow-glass beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Propulsion steady; final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and largely propulsive, with vivid sensory anchors (mist, wet stone, spray) and purposeful diction. However, mild overwriting appears in stacked modifiers and slightly precious phrasing: "verdant parapet," "radiant hush," "insatiably creative," "luminous coral-gold that seemed to hold dawn itself." The essence-capture sequence ("consciousness stretched thin, weaving between") leans abstract where concrete sensory struggle would sharpen pressure. A brief paraphrase loop: "the work took hours" followed by "sun rose higher" restates duration without added detail. Sentence openings vary, paragraph rhythm breathes appropriately, and no major scaffold or template cadence disrupts flow. Figurative density is moderate and does not obscure causality, though one mixed vehicle ("grafting invisible branches onto a living root") blurs physical logic momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening line anchors voice and stakes. High information density (most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere). "The interlaced hush" recurs with shifting meaning. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the unraveling cascade. Minor artifacts: "exhume from the weave" is slightly strained (exhume typically applies to buried bodies, not woven objects); "ground you properly" carries a faint therapeutic-register echo in a peak beat. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and controlled with varied syntax and strong rhythm: "the damaged murals seemed to frame absence itself," "a monument to the unmappable, a chapel constructed from gaps and stone." Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor deductions: "methodically curious by nature" is label-only exposition; "shielded openness—revealing what she'd discovered while protecting what she couldn't prove" uses a dash to define the phrase rather than letting it emerge from action; and the penultimate paragraph's "map of human longing" phrase risks abstraction. No loops or template cadence; momentum is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong with varied syntax and purposeful imagery: "the library appeared through the murk like a cathedral's ghost," "brass cylinders remained intact, scattered like dropped cigarettes." Information density is high, compressing two years of backstory efficiently. However, several phrases rely on elevated abstractions that slow momentum: "sophisticated melancholy," "theoretical collaboration," "strange mathematics of connection across time and loss." The final paragraph contains minor paraphrase loops—"threads connecting" is restated conceptually three times across adjacent sentences. The phrase "delivered by different hands into different depths" gestures toward lyricism but lands slightly ornamental. No grammatical errors or significant filter-verb stacks. The read-aloud rhythm varies naturally until the closing, which adopts a more uniform meditative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, discovery, or action. Clarity is strong with no major loops. However, a paraphrase-loop appears: "The ghost wanted her to do" (paragraph 4) immediately followed by "what the ghost was trying to articulate" (paragraph 6) restates the same realization without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence emerges in paragraph 8: "She painted... each brushstroke... The graffiti spiraled... The ghost helped her encode..." runs a parallel structure across four sentences without taught pattern (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "frost on glass" (paragraph 2) is a familiar image for ephemeral patterns. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The closure beat ("The storm sang with them") is clear but leans slightly abstract. Cumulative deductions place this in mid-7s; artifacts do not touch closure directly but appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies across the climb; floor markers ("Fifth floor. Sixth.") create propulsion. Information density is high: each diary entry advances both plot and emotional charge. Minor scaffold: "She had served Captain Thessaly for twelve years aboard the Nimbus Cloud, cleaning quarters and mending sails, until the airship had made its final mooring at this frozen tower above the world" compresses necessary backstory but reads slightly expository. "Affectionately detached" borders on abstract label-speak. Opening and closing images (frost-etched window, patient ghosts) are strong. No loops or metaphor muddle. Overall clean, with one or two lines that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declarative "Grief, she wrote" against longer accumulative sentences building atmospheric detail. Information density is high—most lines advance memorial hypothesis through concrete observation. Minor template stems appear: "She thought of Victor's last transmission" and "She touched the telescope's worn surface" follow identical subject-verb-object patterns in the final third. "Memory written in absence. Wholeness spooled through air" delivers fragment variation purposefully. The phrase "clouds gathered in a formation she catalogued simply as homecoming" lands the closure image cleanly, though "satisfied" in the penultimate sentence tells rather than showing closure through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clarity and momentum are strong; sentences carry high information density (the tree library description does triple work: setting, guild philosophy, impending destruction). Rhythm varies naturally with no template cadence. Minor issues: "sacred, doomed attempt" and "mirroring the sky inside walls" recur across multiple beats without evolving—risking loop territory—and "heightened stillness" + "held breath" is a slight cliché pairing. The closing triad ("walked out... took its first swing... thought") stacks three moves cleanly but edges toward mechanical symmetry. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts. One paraphrase wobble: paragraph 8's "paradox of crafting recognition without possessing it" closely echoes earlier phrasing about assembling components into wholes she can't verify. Still, the prose remains propulsive and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively between technical observation ("Twenty-three years old and diligently curious since childhood") and action propulsion ("She didn't wait for permission"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "The stranded luminance" appears in both Maren's explanation and the narrative closure paragraph, creating slight synonym churn. No metaphor muddle or template cadence. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the cartographic motif. Clarity and concision are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose maintains clarity throughout. However, several issues accumulate: the mirror-chamber beat relies on a cluster of filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she saw it finally") that dull immediacy at a pivotal moment (−0.4). The phrase "hauntingly bright" recurs without evolving its function, and "ancient and new as driftwood washed to unfamiliar shores" is a strained, over-reaching simile that muddles rather than sharpens the closure image (−0.3 for figurative incoherence). Template cadence appears in the reflection paragraph: "One showed her younger… another depicted her ancient… In the center reflection, she saw herself…" (−0.2). Paraphrase loop: the penultimate and final paragraphs both restate that Celeste now possesses "the rhythm of repair" without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is moderate; many lines perform description without advancing stakes or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in early paragraphs (ghost, wars, seeds, settlement, nebula compressed efficiently). However, several phrases loop: "strangers became family" appears three times, and "floating rock arches" recurs without functional variation. The phrase "organize work crews that crossed factional boundaries" and "sharing economy they'd built" read as abstract summary rather than concrete action. Minor filter-verb stacking in the middle ("began organizing," "watched as her words catalyzed") dulls immediacy. The final image ("eternal, violet sky") recharges earlier motifs cleanly, but mid-story beats lean on stock connectors ("But lately," "But success bred") and template cadence. No clarity-breaking artifacts, but momentum sags in the merchant-offer paragraph due to expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent—"land forgot itself," "silence became absolute," "fractals of moments folding into themselves"—but some vehicles strain: "bleeding into waves that had long stopped counting their own rhythm" anthropomorphizes without grounding. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully. Two paraphrase loops appear: "not to stop the end" / "but to plant something" restates the same content across adjacent clauses; "not as sound, but as the shape sound once made" recycles the concept. Template cadence: "Not her voice…but the structure of it" / "Not about salvation…This was about remembering" uses parallel negation twice in close succession. Information density is moderate; some lines ("the clock itself had long since stopped meaning what it once did. Now it measured something else entirely") could compress. Rhythm supports mood but does not accelerate or breathe with scene needs because there is minimal scene pressure. No major clarity breaks, but the figurative overlay and minor loops prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively ("She heard the cry before she saw them" vs. the longer blueprint-parsing sentence). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor loop: "lost souls who wandered" / "lost travelers" is near-synonym churn. The fruit that "screamed when picked" and "graceless beauty" carry vivid specificity. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images bookend with charged recursion. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "different molecular chains playing off each other" is restated as "polymers that could self-organize after separation, materials that remembered their connections" within two paragraphs; "the divergent path she'd advocated and the one he'd wanted weren't actually contradictory" is followed immediately by "they could pursue both simultaneously." The final paragraph contains template cadence ("She would return… She would finish…") and slightly elevates register ("transformation meant letting go of one form to achieve another") in a way that drifts from the established voice. These patterns cluster in the closure zone, triggering the artifact penalty. Propulsion is otherwise clean, and the foam-pattern observation integrates action with perception effectively, but the loops and slight overwriting in the final third lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: moonlight as "distilled absence," books like "luminous fruit," grooves as "anonymous confession." Two frictions: "mindfully scattered" in the opening feels like decorative diction, and "glimmering parole" in paragraph five introduces an abstraction ("release into understanding") that paraphrases the prior concept of clean slates without advancing pressure. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, but the lyric register occasionally tips into ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative control: "slick and glistening like bone," "feast of failures," "ice began to weep." Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Two frictions lower the score: (1) "The stored remorse of the fortress tried to subsume her entirely" tells peak pressure rather than showing embodied threat in real time; (2) a slight density dip in the middle stretch where action compresses into summary ("she moved from pool to pool, from coral branch to frozen coral branch, touching and tasting and analyzing"). Information density is high elsewhere, and the opening/closing lines charge effectively. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is moderate—lines often do two jobs (e.g., weight description + metaphor). Two text-pattern issues deduct here: "empathetically decisive" echoes as a label in two separate paragraphs without dramatized cost, and the final paragraph stacks template-cadence constructions ("the gradual, inevitable turning…of isolation into communion" parallels "bridges…constructed from…"). Figurative language (gears, borrowed starlight, breath/song) recurs purposefully but "bridges built from voices raised in shared song" in the closing line borders on stock metaphor. No paraphrase loops or severe scaffold; proofreading is clean. One minor artifact penalty (−0.4) for label repetition and template cadence in the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm ("canyon walls rose...like the curved interior of a skull"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "modify not circuits or machinery, but the fundamental architecture of human recall" restates the Memory Archive Project concept redundantly. The final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes ("began to work...began, finally, to make it whole"), losing sentence-level propulsion at closure. Figurative density is high ("helix-minded," "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "oblique observation") without always advancing scene pressure, trending toward overwriting in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances setting, stake, or action). Minor loop: "She'd explored it once before, mapping its turns by lamplight, finding nothing" restates the prior failure without added pressure. A few stock phrases ("echo of her own breath," "hair drifted like seaweed") lean generic. Sentence openings vary; clarity is strong. The closure beat is clean—no artifacts touch the planting moment. Figurative language (serpentine, intestines, spider silk) is purposeful but occasionally clusters without payoff. Overall propulsion is steady with minor scaffold in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in technical passages (wire tension, porcelain properties, stress-crack mechanics). However, two paraphrase loops appear: the paragraph beginning "She had spent weeks analyzing" repeats the concept that cracks tell stories across three sentences with synonym variation (fissure/crack, forces/tension, empathy/responding). The climax paragraph stacks filter constructions: "felt rather than heard," "felt the rhythms," "felt the vibrations." These clusters dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character (worry stone, exile shame), world (covenant mechanics), or pressure (beings' responses). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at "The magnetic beings blazed suddenly" and breathing at "She pressed her thumb into the dent." Two minor loops: "thoughtfully, precisely" appears twice in identical positions (paragraphs 3 and 5), and "beauty in the difficult" / "beauty in difficulty" / "most beautiful truths" recur without additional pressure. No clarity breaks; figurative language (constellation, poetry) is coherent. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third; the frequency-tuning sequence advances pressure through concrete image. However, the final third shows paraphrase loops: "cataloging human silence and human endurance were two paths toward the same destination" restates the diary's contents just summarized, and "her sister's voice teaching her that empathy begins…" recaps the insight already shown. "Varieties of silence" / "varieties of resilience" is purposeful parallelism but borders on mechanical. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the closure beat could tighten by one or two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages rely on paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "Her motivation had crystallized… to cultivate serenity… to find stillness" restates the same idea without added pressure. "She began to journalize… her entries covering… 'Day one with the seed,' she wrote" is redundant narration of the same act. Template cadence appears in the opening ("was an ambitious herbalist… was both gift and curse"). The corpse flower's stench is described vividly but the final paragraph leans toward thematic summary ("the greatest cultivation was not of plants, but of presence itself") rather than propulsive closure image. Clarity remains intact but momentum dips under reflective weight.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high throughout—most lines advance setting, character goal, or world rules simultaneously. The "whirling silence" phrase is evocative and voice-motivated. However, a few scaffolding patterns appear: "Kael + [verb]" stems repeat across adjacent paragraphs ("Kael followed," "Kael anchored," "Kael held," "Kael fired"), and minor paraphrase loops occur (e.g., "ancient rock arches" in paragraph two, "ancient stone formations" in paragraph nine). The final two paragraphs shift toward summary and thesis statement ("She'd discovered not just... but...") rather than sustaining the image-driven propulsion of the discovery beat. No major filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and purposeful with strong momentum through discovery beats. Information density is high: each paragraph advances investigation or reweights understanding. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately. Minor scaffold detected: "hazy precision" appears twice as descriptor, once narratively and once thematically, without sufficient dramatization of the concept in action. The phrase "singular convergence" is used three times, bordering on keyword recurrence. Figurative language ("wound in the labyrinth's geometry," containers "singing their warning") is coherent and restrained. No major loops or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are well-distributed; the ritual sequence propels with concrete actions ("pressed the bell silent," "struck the three smallest bells"). Figurative density is high ("ribbons of violet and gold," "doors opening inward," "chains breaking in reverse") but mostly serves the synesthetic premise and remains legible. Two patterns weaken momentum: (1) The motivation paragraph front-loads abstract telling ("to certify wonder as essential...awe was not luxury but necessity") that could be compressed, and (2) near the end, "somewhere" is repeated in adjacent beats ("Somewhere, a sculptor...Somewhere else, a child") in a told summary rather than dramatized consequence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; minor register drift in phrases like "chromatic light" during peak action, but voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "silvered wood she'd placed two days prior" = marker function + timeline + her agency). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the shimmer sequence, breathing in the final beat. Two minor slips: "avalanchingly quiet" in paragraph one feels slightly coined without full pattern-teaching, and "fold into inaccessible distance" borders on abstract metaphor. The final image—touching stone, feeling silence pool—is concrete and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("Joy propagates at measurable speeds. Longing has half-lives"). One mixed metaphor: "shadow fracturing across his workspace" (shadows don't fracture) reduces clarity mid-beat. A paraphrase loop appears: "Emotion has structure...It follows laws" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the exposition block ("The stars are equations too. Each one a variable...") slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure the closure image. Information density is strong; lines multi-task without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening paragraph's trembling syntax mirrors Kessa's state. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, the phrase "fade from memory to myth" recurs three times without added meaning, creating mild redundancy. The herbalist's "I still grow flowers from that conversation—planted them after we spoke and they've never stopped blooming" edges toward on-the-nose metaphor but stays within voice. No opacity or loops that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high. Strong images: "quartz arbor," "frost… ferns and spirals," "prism itself darkened, shot through with cloudy threads." However, several lines loop concepts: "shifted hush—that peculiar silence"; "truthful lies" is defined twice; "commune with the world" and "learn to see properly" overlap. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("objects absorbed emotions," "world was stranger," "impossible truth") instead of letting the prism image do the work. Template cadence appears in the backstory section ("He had taught… He had also whispered…"). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid images (amber "glowing with trapped sunlight," silence "knitting itself closed"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "raveling silence" / "unraveling" recurs without added pressure; "stoically sparkling" is used identically twice; the final three paragraphs restate the message's success and the mother's completion in overlapping language. The phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" (title element) functions as throat-clearing rather than concrete image. Filter-verb stacks ("could hear," "would reach," "would wonder") appear in several beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters heavily in descriptive beats ("broken promises," "dissolved into confusion," "bartered awakenings," "refusing entropy's claim") without clear pattern-teaching. Some phrases loop conceptually: "quietly determined" echoes across paragraphs, and "deliberate" recurs as a modifier four times. The striking sequence propels cleanly, but earlier exposition slightly drags momentum. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with high information density and strong rhythm modulation. Figurative language ("murmur of half-remembered dreams," "petals around a center") is controlled and voice-consistent. Two pattern slips lower the score: "cyclically spontaneous" recurs as a phrase in paragraphs two and four without evolving meaning, creating a minor loop; and "coordinates no computer could parse" / "mapped themselves as coordinates pointing everywhere" share template cadence. No major artifacts touch closure, but the repetitions dull momentum slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (sea glass "blue as forgetting," shadows moving "against the light's rotation"). Information density is high in the opening and lantern-room discovery. Several template cadences appear: "This became their language… This was how you bottled safety… The ghosts would stack… She would read…" in the final third, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: "The air shifted, and she felt it—that elusive sensation" immediately followed by "She understood now" restates rather than advances. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation. Minor: "smooth stones" and "sea glass… worn smooth" repeat the descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the piece maintains forward momentum through the ritual sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "laughing as dark clouds gathered" / "still chuckling" / "found herself laughing again" recycles the same character note without added pressure. The phrase "otherworldly routine" is both a concept label and a thematic echo that abstracts rather than dramatizes. Filter-verb stacks in the lamp-room sequence ("felt the familiar surge," "saw three ships alter course") dull immediacy. No proximity to famous lines; clarity remains high despite moderate density loss.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies well across the piece, and sensory detail is vivid without overwriting. However, several scaffold patterns weaken momentum: "She had been watchful all her life—observant of..." restates the same idea across the dash; "Not the polite exchanges...but the quietly explosive confessions" uses a standard not-X-but-Y template; and "inevitable, essential" stacks near-synonyms without adding meaning. The opening's "painting everything in shades of pearl and amber" and later "golden threads" risk stock imagery, though the morpho wing's specific optical mechanics ground the light motif. "Stories found her the way water finds cracks" is effective, but adjacency to "inevitable, essential" in the same sentence creates density without propulsion. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and grammar is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or plot. Minor template cadence in the dream-mapping passage: "Here: a woman… There: a man…" reads list-like but serves the accumulative design. One paraphrase loop: "the labyrinth had always been incomplete" → "Sorrow could be measured… But healing happened in the spaces between" restates without added pressure. No figurative muddle or register drift; clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level clarity is generally high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("luminous moths," "threads of gold and rose") is vivid and mostly coherent. Two issues lower the score: (1) "bound release" is named twice in final beats where image could replace label, edging toward thematic echo (−0.3). (2) Sentence openings in the middle third show mild template cadence: "They had been sung," "The melody was simple," "The mica window began," "The woven dawns responded" (−0.4 for template-cadence cluster). Information density is adequate; momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is solid in the first half. However, several beats loop: the "nestled paradoxes" concept is restated three times (shelves paragraph, book title, Eleanor's realization) without added pressure. "The woman" is repeated as a subject stem across multiple paragraphs in the final third. The clock-strike ending is clean, but "smoothed the crumpled invitation once more" paraphrases the opening gesture without reweighting it. Minor filter-verb cluster in the middle ("feeling," "sensing") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean with strong rhythm and controlled density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Information layering is purposeful: "creeping normality" defined through concrete examples before being named. Minor loop: "small act" appears twice in the final paragraph ("small act of memory," "small acts of creation"), slight synonym pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Sentence variety supports momentum; figurative language ("morning mist," "earth that remembered") is coherent and restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and vivid imagery ("breath forming constellations," "needles on brass dials began their trembling dance"). Information density is high; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in the accumulation of figurative language: "ice-veined corridors," "crystalline script," "quartz hush," "luminous vows" cluster densely without always earning their metaphoric weight. "Imposed their own quartz hush" borders on precious. No loops or scaffold detected. The final image is strong and propulsive. Template cadence appears briefly in paragraph structure but doesn't harm momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery: "dying stars," "salt-thick darkness," "comfort in his expression curdled into something desperate." Minor template cadence in the setup: "She'd told Marcus… She'd whispered to Old Chen… She'd confided in Vera…" runs identical stems across three sentences without taught pattern payoff (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the sound of trust breaking" (paragraph 2) and "the sound of trust shattering" (paragraph 7) restate without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (compass mechanics, taste-mapping, forest elections compressed efficiently). Figurative language mostly lands ("symphony of minerals and metal," "atmosphere as identity"). Two friction points lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph six—"hadn't been transformed…had always been" restates the emergence idea across two sentences without added pressure. (2) The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" recurs as both descriptor and thematic flag without dramatized cost, trending toward stock poeticism. Minor template cadence in the list of weather-carriers (woman/man/children parallel stems). Closure beat itself remains clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively; information density is high. Some overwriting clusters: "spectral shards that painted the walls with auroral sorrow" stacks metaphors, and "mnemonically gifted" appears three times as identical phrase across the piece (template repetition). "The words landed like hammer blows" is a stock construction. Opening and closing lines are strong (descent/ascent frame). Clarity remains solid throughout; no causality breaks from line-level issues. Figurative density is controlled except in the cave description paragraph, where "cathedral," "confessional," and "auroral" compete slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and the opening anchors voice effectively ("gilded-leaf calligrapher's fingers trembled"). Information density is high in the Archive discovery sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the way people spoke to each other" followed by "Conversations became transactional, clipped," and "words rest when they're too true to be spoken, waiting for someone brave enough to listen" echoes the earlier setup without adding new pressure. The phrase "something older and more resilient began to bloom again" is generic metaphor. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "watched") cluster in the middle third without voice necessity. Minor scaffold: "She said nothing, and he left uncomfortable" tells rather than shows his discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory specificity is high—"crystalline structure centuries of frozen time," "thumb-sized piece remained." Minor scaffold appears: "Each bell hung... mechanisms of counterweight and wind-catch that kept the bells in constant, subtle motion" could compress. The phrase "muted vigor" in the penultimate paragraph echoes the prompt tone label without organic integration. Information density is solid; no loops or template cadence runs mar clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high: "strangely organic" recurs with escalating function (texture, then combustion property, then thematic charge). Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short during crisis ("The android needed fire."), longer and syntactically complex during ritual. No paraphrase loops, though "strangely organic" appears three times; each use advances understanding. One minor friction: "strangely organic cells seeming to breathe while Unit-47 suffocated" leans slightly purple in register, but the personification serves the android's desperate state. The opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes cleanly. Zero scaffolding or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images (bougainvillea, dawn light, fountain). However, prose artifacts cluster: "sandstorm calm" appears three times with identical phrasing; "vibrant courtyard" and "liminal hours" recur as stock descriptors; the final paragraph stacks exposition ("Listening…wasn't passive. It was following…holding space…proving through presence") in a tell-heavy summary that dulls momentum. "The way plants hear rain after drought" is fresh, but "discerning curation of compassion" elevates diction beyond the scene's needs. Template cadence appears in the neighbor-interview sequence ("Old Mr. Hernandez…Mrs. Okoye…the teenager"). No major loops, but repetitive framing and the scaffold-heavy ending lower density.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but mostly purposeful (kelp hymns, spider-web closure). However, several lines loop conceptually: "calm defiance" appears three times with minimal variation; "encoding her own liberation/autonomy" restates across paragraphs. "Mysterious familiarity" in the penultimate paragraph feels ornamental. Template cadence in the opening: "its corroded walls draped... each bloom a syllable... She was what they called..." creates rhythmic monotony. The metaphor stack in peak beats ("lattice of strength," "frequencies only she could generate") blurs concrete action. Apply −0.8 for density and loops; no closure-beat artifacts prevent deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong specificity ("barnacled body," "salt crystal growing chamber," "coffee grounds forming a perfect match"). However, the phrase "gleaming silence" appears four times, and "deleted," "evaporate," "disappeared" cluster in the dementia passage without sufficient variance. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the recovery work ("Each recovered memory crystallized and held"), flattening momentum at closure. Information density is high elsewhere, but the closing beat needed one concrete image instead of abstract confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and carries a consistent lyric rhythm. Some figurative language is fresh ("roots drinking starlight"), but several phrases feel overwritten or abstract: "tranquil blaze of focus," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic alignment." Minor template cadence in the gathering sequence: "She touched…she offered…they forgot" follows a repetitive stem pattern. The final paragraph moralizes slightly ("that ignorance…was the truest form of salvation"), telling rather than trusting the image. No severe loops or artifacts, but density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and largely free of loops. Strong lines: "meteors scored white lines across the August sky," "the quality of something ancient wearing a contemporary face." Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. No major artifacts, but "patiently nimble" recurs identically three times (a minor template echo), and "mysterious familiarity" appears twice in quick succession. The final paragraph's metaphor cascade (sugar → tea → lessons → bridge) compresses meaning efficiently but risks slight over-explanation where image alone might have sufficed.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong opening line and purposeful final image. Information density is high, especially in the demonstration beat. However, repetitive phrasing appears: "tragically radiant" recurs three times, "resonance/resonance structures" echoes across many sentences without varied texture, and "through resonance" becomes template-like. Paraphrase loop at "Memories aren't meant to be stored like data. They're living architectures" / "preserve the pattern, not the thing itself" restates without pressure shift. These artifacts accumulate but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and mostly propulsive, but several patterns drag momentum. "Pearl twilight" appears four times, "wisely enduring" twice, "stalactites dripped" three times—these recur as labels rather than evolving images. The phrase "calibrated treason" is introduced in dialogue then repeated twice more without reweighting. Paragraph structure varies well. Sentence openings show some variety, but runs of "The [noun]" and "She [verb]" create mild template cadence. No major loops or contradictions, but density could tighten; the penultimate paragraph restates theme already established. Stock metaphor: "keys open locks we didn't know existed."

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm and no major loops. However, stock metaphors appear without transformation: "webs of intrigue," "shadow government," "lived in the spaces between words." The phrase "the universe hummed its secret song" recurs four times, becoming a thematic label rather than an image that accumulates pressure. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she understood," "she felt") cluster in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. Figurative density is moderate but several vehicles (seashell/nexus/echo) compete without sharp integration.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The opening and closing images (candles, aurora) bracket the piece cleanly. Minor deductions: "borrowed starlight" appears three times with slightly different vehicles (candles/ice, aurora/magnetic fields, ghosts/truth/love), creating mild figurative drift. One scaffold phrase: "She had to expose this truth—not for sensation, but because it mattered" explains motive already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The piece avoids major loops, but a few phrases trend toward ornamental repetition: "hidden patterns" appears in setup, middle, and closure without added pressure each time; "scintillatingly somber" is used twice in near-identical phrasing (moonlight pools, fireflies against night) without transformation. "Everything was knotwork and tension, invisible effort made briefly visible" summarizes rather than showing a new instance. Minor template cadence in the teaching-plan paragraph ("if she saw... if she understood... then Chen would teach"). No grammar errors. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the pacing fits the Accumulative mode. Overall clean with small texture drag in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high in the reconstruction sequence: memo fragments, geometric anchor detail, and radiation-push mechanics unfold without redundancy. However, paraphrase loops appear: "spent fifteen years debunking conspiracy theories" / "Come to tell us our diamond curse is nonsense" restate the same setup, and "They sacrificed everything else to save the orchard. The diamond is buried here, still working" repeats closure logic already clear from Maya's prior thought. Template cadence in the climactic paragraph ("The comfortable lie had been...The uncomfortable truth was...") flattens propulsion. The opening sentence effectively anchors voice and stakes; the final line's "stop digging" metaphor charges earlier excavation language.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is controlled with strong opening and closing images. Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears in the middle: "The truth was grittier than either side wanted, whimsical as a drunk oracle, practical as a farmer's almanac" uses parallel construction that feels decorative. "Gritty and strange and perfectly, whimsically true" in the final line echoes the earlier pattern without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language is mostly coherent. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes appropriately at transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do double work. Two issues dock this: (1) "lonesome splendor" appears three times (music box, chest feeling, final paragraph), creating a pattern-echo that reads decorative rather than charged; (2) minor scaffold in "This was why she'd begun her strange work, her true motivation finally crystallizing"—the phrase tells what the composite moment has just shown. No loops or filter-verb stacks harm closure. Figurative language is controlled andlegible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance image, character, or conflict. The opening "drift-ice marina groaned beneath Maren's boots" anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several beats lean on elevated metaphor that slows momentum: "frequencies only she could feel," "crystallize into something structured, beautiful," and "sonic absolution" recur without accumulating new pressure. The phrase "logically emotional" appears twice in identical phrasing (orientation and Maren's self-description), creating a small paraphrase loop. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the viaduct crossing and breathing at waypoint arrival. Information density is high: most sentences do double work (advance plot and world or character and theme). Two minor loops appear: "the sensation of the world's hidden forces becoming tangible" restates the magnetic pull already shown, and "their prison transformed into a mirror" echoes the earlier lake-as-reflection image without adding pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("revolution like moonlight across ice") appears sparingly and remains coherent. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies well; information density is high in the evidence-gathering beats. Two paraphrase loops: "made deaths like his possible" / "preventable death" recurs without added pressure; "reverberate/reverberating" appears four times, twice in the same paragraph, creating synonym churn around the prompt keyword. Template cadence in "She found... She documented... She felt..." across adjacent paragraphs (−0.4). Figurative language is generally clear, though "entangled memories" and "fortified vulnerability" are prompt imports that feel affixed rather than organic. Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate to cap the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; no template cadence. The opening line ("the weight of fifteen years pressing against his chest") is vivid and stakes-charged. Clarity is strong; no loops or synonym churn. Two issues lower the score: (1) the simile "understanding arriving by the way light breaks through storm clouds—gradually, then all at once, illuminating what had been obscured" is overwritten and explanatory, violating show-don't-tell in a key recognition beat; (2) "This was the calm before realization, that suspended moment where truth gathered itself to strike" is authorial commentary that tells what the scene should dramatize. Both occur in non-closure beats but slow momentum. Information density is otherwise high; final image is concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and figurative language is generally clear ("currents of yellow fog," "prophecies written in refracted light"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "yearning algorithm" is restated across adjacent paragraphs ("algorithms of desire," "mathematics of human hunger," "yearning to understand yearning itself") without new pressure. The phrase "steadily curious" recurs as a template stem. These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality or closure, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and good information density. "Brightly attentive" and "moving brightly across her keyboard" feel ornamental—the adverb doesn't add pressure or POV color. Minor template cadence in the investigation sequence: "She found breadcrumbs. A comment thread... A tagged photo... Then the numbers..." The pacing works but the parallel structure is mechanical. The final paragraph repeats "numbers pulsed" and "timestamp, coordinate, promise" in a way that edges toward summary. No major loops or artifacts that obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative work: "moved through disputes like twilight through trees," "ice floes groaned and separated." Information density is high. Two deductions: mild overwriting in the opening third ("shadow-laced," "impossible fruit," "weighted breath...thick as fog" cluster within 150 words without pattern-teaching). One paraphrase loop near closure: "gathering fragments" echoes earlier "scattered truths...reshaping" within three lines without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., parasol establishes heirloom,break, prophetic feeling in one beat). Rhythm varies purposefully—longer reflection in shelter, shorter action on boat. Two minor artifacts: "she simply opened her eyes and found that her relationship with reality had loosened" leans scaffold-like (the "simply...found" construction); "sounds like ice breaking, like spring approaching, like the earth itself exhaling" stacks three similes in sequence, diluting specificity. No paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary. The final paragraph delivers clean propulsion without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, the final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops: "rediscovering in each other what had always grown there, waiting for the right season to bear fruit" restates the grafting metaphor without new pressure. The phrase "destined mismatches silently proving that the best unions are those everyone doubted" summarizes theme rather than advancing action. Stock metaphor reliance ("bud break in spring," "suspended in honey") and template cadence in the closing ("They sat together…as autumn deepened…waiting") dull the ending's propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high in the opening and middle. Minor scaffold detected: "the prophet said" / "Maya said" alternation is functional but slightly mechanical. "Touch the void," "touch the echo" is near-repetition. Figurative language ("desert thinks," "kinetic parapet rose like breaths") is vivid but sometimes borders decorative. Final paragraph ("It would hold. It would remember") uses parallelism purposefully but risks loop. No major clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but gentle. Zero hard artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied, with strong images (dove gray case, vines climbing walls, arcs in black-and-white). Information density is high in description, but several beats loop conceptually: "not preserving puzzles but creating them, offering frameworks where meaning could grow wild" paraphrases the earlier "fragments...arranging them until meaning emerged," and the final paragraph restates transformation themes already dramatized. Template cadence surfaces in the summary passage: "They would photograph...They would paint...They would plant" uses parallel stems without variation. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts touch the closure image, but the paraphrase loops and summary phrasing lower momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (crystal's sonic property, etymology examples, testing against archives). Clarity and concision hold. Deductions: "suspended hush" appears three times in slightly varied phrasings (library held its breath, suspended hush of dawn, suspended hush that would follow), creating minor loop pressure. "Serendipity" sequence is vivid but borders on illustrative rather than propulsive. A few filter verbs ("thought of," "hoped") dull immediacy in peak preparation beats. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("fog moved through the sculptures like something alive," "cells whispered their slow surrender"). Some elevated metaphors risk overwriting in close proximity ("tidal longing," "magnetic memory," "film dissolve before it could be developed"), though they remain legible and voice-consistent. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the setup paragraphs ("He believed," "He pulled") but not pervasive. The closure beat is sharp and propulsive without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied rhythm and concrete imagery. Information density is high in the repair sequence. Two minor drags: "changelessly constant" appears twice in identical phrasing (Moon description), a small loop. The phrase "luminous ache" recurs without variation, functioning as a motif but creating slight template feel. Opening and closing lines are purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops in peak beats. The prose propels cleanly through the repair sequence without scaffolding, though the double "changelessly constant" and recycled "luminous ache" prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates controlled rhythm and vivid imagery ("cotton-sea of clouds," "jagged piece of a broken vinyl record, its grooves catching the mountain light"), with strong verbs and concrete nouns in most beats. However, several lines show decorative stacking without advancing pressure: "pulsing stillness, the kind that exists in the breath between heartbeats" is metaphor-on-metaphor, and "the scent of hope—something like lavender and ozone and possibility—perfumed the air" lists three near-synonyms for an abstract concept. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("about breakfast routines, about Linda's favorite color, about the squeak") and filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("She called," "She recorded," "She explained"). The phrase "hymning the mundane" recurs without variation, and "radiant haven" appears in both the opening and closing paragraphs as unearned bookend repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance mystery or atmosphere. However, several passages loop or over-explain: "The question seemed trivial until she realized it was fundamental. If shadows could disappear without traveling, then space itself had seams" restates the same insight. "The quietly deliberate scholar in Mira warred with the terrified shadow-being who'd believed herself real" tells rather than showing the internal conflict in action. The phrase "quietly deliberate" appears three times, creating minor scaffold. The spoon-bending exposition ("when ordinary cutlery twisted into impossible geometries and rewrote the laws of causation") is vivid but slightly overwrought for a single beat. No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats ("Show me," she said) alternate with longer lyric passages. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Minor template cadence in paragraph three: "His voice carried...," "The bones he arranged...," "What are you making..." uses similar stems but within tolerance. One paraphrase slip: "the universe was stranger and more merciful than she'd ever imagined" in the penultimate paragraph echoes the earlier "chasm" realization without adding new pressure, a −0.2 nudge. The closing image "nostalgic innovation, where old magic and new understanding grew together" walks the line between evocative and slightly overwrought but remains legible. No major loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high in the polishing beats. Two paraphrase loops: "as memories resurfaced" appears in paragraph 3 and 19 without added pressure; "earthbound" recurs in paragraphs 1, 11, and final without evolving meaning. Template cadence in paragraph 9–10 ("This amber shard... That green curve... The blue fragments...") teaches a pattern but stretches three beats. No major clarity breaks. Final image propels cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with most sentences doing double duty (setting, character, theme). However, several paraphrase loops and template constructions appear: "the watchful dreamer tending her impossible garden" echoes "the watchful dreamer, tending to the garden" from the opening; "began to speak" followed by quote is scaffolding. The phrase "honeyed hush" appears twice in similar contexts without added pressure. A few figurative choices muddle slightly: "grafting hope onto ruins" in the final line feels abstract after concrete moss and amber work. No major artifacts touch closure, but mid-passage loops reduce density by ~−0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("Critics would call it experimental, she knew. They would discuss...") but does not dull the closure beat. The final paragraph's figurative density ("each word a collected hope, each sentence a small ceremony") is pattern-taught and pays off without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the ritual beats (silk threads, tiny bells, musical notation). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "felt it pulse gently as though awakening" and "felt the shift, subtle but unmistakable" use parallel "felt" stems without added pressure. The phrase "she spins golden stories" is explained in reflection rather than dramatized, creating a small loop between metaphor and exposition. Clarity remains strong; no major artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, the opening contains minor paraphrase loops: "breath crystallizing" and "cold it seemed to stop time" restate freezing. The phrase "patterns that echoed the constellation visible the night her daughter had wandered" and later "her daughter's heartbeat had matched the pulsar rhythm" recycle the cosmic-entanglement concept without added pressure. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("cartography, cosmography") feels ornamental. Stock metaphor: "branches reaching upward like petrified fingers." One clarity slip: "discarded items" is vague until specified. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete detail ("bronze doors corroded shut," "velvet cloth"). Minor loop issues: "arriving at dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight" / "Morning light... At noon... Midnight" restates the same pattern within two paragraphs. "Understanding bloomed slowly, like ice melting in reluctant spring" is a mixed seasonal metaphor (bloom/melt/spring overlap without coherent vehicle). Filter-verb density is moderate but not intrusive. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary well. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and image-rich, with strong specificity ("kerosene lamp burner, its glass chimney cracked in a pattern that reminded her of branching tributaries"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Two friction points: "shingled hush—layers of silence stacked upon silence, each one slightly different from the last, creating a quietness so profound it became almost audible" is a minor paraphrase loop explaining the coinage in the same breath. The phrase "boundary-lessly trapped" is used twice with identical framing ("trapped... but by"), creating template cadence. Information density is generally high, but the closure paragraph leans toward summary ("understood then why," "some traps were also sanctuaries") rather than propulsive image. No major artifacts touch the final beat, but cumulative minor issues prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do two jobs), and sentence openings diversify. Minor overwriting in the final third: "humble alchemy of blade and wood and crystallized time" stacks abstractions, and "rust-hued peace of acceptance" edges toward label-speak in a high-stakes closure beat. The paraphrase loop "Viktor had been here. He was gone. But...he remained" recaps without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She'd been trying to negotiate, to explain, but how did one justify the slow abandonment of everything one had meant to become?" advances character, stake, and tone). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening at key beats. One pattern artifact: "perhaps" recurs as a hedge across multiple paragraphs without clear escalation of its meaning. The opening's temporal slippage ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") is pattern-taught and pays off, so no penalty there. Minor filter-verb use ("saw," "felt") is voice-consistent and doesn't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with strong specificity ("brass sextant piece, the navigator's arc still gleaming") and purposeful compression. Information density is high in the systems-mapping passage. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "questions" (end of paragraph two) and "puzzle out new equations" (paragraph six) restate the same curiosity without added pressure; "maze of intentions" appears three times with minimal functional shift. Template cadence in the montage section: "They worked...They channeled...The solar energy was rerouted...The excessive heat...warmed" stacks passive and list-like constructions. No artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalty under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short urgency at "one note, thin and wavering" vs. longer reflective sentences). Information density is high in the opening (clock scribe, conservatory history, stage fright) but some scaffold persists: "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times, "glacial hush" twice, and "soundless sanctuary" twice without added meaning. The phrase "dreams were fragile things" is a near-cliché. No loops that obscure causality, and the final image is clean. Sentence openings vary, but the pattern of "She [verb]" recurs noticeably in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is strong and information density high in action beats. Overwriting issues: "serene upheaval" appears three times, "thoughtfully clear" twice, "architecture of lies" twice—these recur as thematic markers but edge toward stock phrasing. "Hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water" is a generic metaphor for realization. Template cadence in the middle section: "Marcus had sought…Now, standing…he understood" and "The legend was false…But standing here…Marcus understood" loop the revelation structure. Sentence variety is good overall, but figurative density in reflective passages (second half of story) accumulates without always advancing pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock metaphor density touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean and mostly propulsive with varied sentence rhythm and no grammar errors. Two significant pattern issues: (1) Paraphrase loop in the final paragraph—"carrying humanity's patient wisdom" restates the preservation theme already established, adding no new pressure or detail. (2) Stock metaphor string at closure: "oceanic hush followed her like a benediction, vast and approving" and fish "following memories encoded in current and tide" layer generic elevated language without concrete sensory anchors. The phrase "understanding flooding through her" is a label-only emotion beat at a pivotal discovery moment. These artifacts don't obscure causality but they dull the line-level execution, especially in the final third where precision matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; opening sentences are long and lyric, closing lines short and charged. Information density is high in the catalog passages. However, multiple phrases lean into decorative figuration without propulsion: "bronze leaves collected like forgotten correspondence," "cathedral abandoned to starlings," "geography of thread and tension." The phrase "projecting presence through her words like a medium summoning spirits" is abstract and elides the actual mechanics of Marina's method. Minor paraphrase loop: "explained absences" is restated conceptually across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Syntax is controlled; no template cadence or grammar errors. Figurative density in several beats (garden, Thomas's hands, the leaf) does not teach a pattern early or pay off with concrete constraint at closure, reducing line-level urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Glass tubes stolen from the medical wing" conveys theft, setting, and risk simultaneously). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "hypothesizing about everything" is vague scaffold; "quaking reverie" appears twice as an external label rather than dramatized state; "bitterly sweet" functions as prompt-element insertion. The phrase "It was small, featherless, translucent. Part organic tissue, part something else—filaments that caught the light like fiber optics, bones that seemed partially metallic" shows strong specificity, but the prior paragraph's "through weeks of discovery" summarizes key work that could have been compressed differently to preserve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies with strong opening and closing images. However, line-level craft shows repeated scaffold: "She had been coming here for three years" immediately followed by exposition; "Today she'd brought Marcus" starts a new paragraph with similar stem. The phrase "gracefully alert quality" appears twice in identical form. Mixed metaphor: "rippled landscapes of third-degree burns" conflates topography with injury in ways that strain plausibility. "Kelp-drift peace" is evocative but the metaphoric vehicle (kelp drifting) does not clearly map to the tenor (calm after storms). Information density is generally high but some lines do double work inefficiently ("The other firefighters at Station 12 knew her story; some looked at her differently, wondering if flame-setting ran in blood" could be tighter).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Figurative language is purposeful ("stone basins collecting only leaves," "emotions swirled around her"). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolution. However, runs of template cadence appear: "She found... Then another... and another"; "They remembered weddings but not joy, funerals but not grief" is elegant parallelism but borders paraphrase. "The memories hadn't vanished; Mara suspected they'd been collected" restates across adjacent clauses. Baseline −0.6 for patterned loops across three instances.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and high information density; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "They harvested seeds from the most stable blooms, each one pulsing with patient luminescence" advances action, image, and theme). Figurative language is purposeful without overwriting. Minor loop observed: "sonar pinging" appears three times with near-identical phrasing ("pulse-nodes singing their sonar pinging," "sending sonar pinging ahead," "The sonar pinging echoed back"), creating template cadence in a recurring action beat (−0.4 in Q7 per the Paraphrase-loop and Template-cadence checks). Propulsion is steady; no clarity issues touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied. Information density is good in descriptive passages ("ancient structure, with its cracked panes and rust-eaten frames"), but several beats loop thematically: the ribbon's lesson is stated twice (rhythm/variations, then music/chorus), and the penultimate paragraph summarizes insights already conveyed. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative") that feels slightly imposed rather than POV-organic. No serious artifacts, but propulsion slows in the final third as summary overtakes scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; information density is high (the opening line anchors ridge, tide, and volcanic glass in twelve words). Figurative language (names "swirling like schools of silver fish," tower as "sentinel") serves concrete images rather than ornament. Two minor frictions lower the score: the phrase "the pause that shouldn't exist, the fraction of time when momentum died and reversed, when the laws of physics held their breath" loops conceptually across three clauses without added detail, costing ~−0.3; and "both eternal and precisely measured, both searing and sacred in their reverie" in the final line stacks parallel structures into template cadence, costing ~−0.4. No outright loops or scaffolding, but these instances dull propulsion slightly at high-value beats.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language ("moth wings," "star-lanced darkness," "velveteen gloom") is vivid without overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. However, two minor issues appear: "velveteen gloom" recurs three times without evolving meaning, trending toward ornamental repetition, and the final paragraph summarizes Mira's future intentions ("already organizing") rather than holding the present-tense image of the rose decision, which would sustain propulsion through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear, varied in syntax, and free of major loops or scaffolding. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe. Information density is solid; each paragraph advances situation or stakes. Minor issues: "trembling threshold where possibility still breathed" leans purple without grounding; "the quill never faltered, the kingfisher's gift of precision" repeats the quill's symbolic role without fresh detail. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but figurative language occasionally substitutes for concrete action (e.g., "her predictive models flowering across the pages").

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (copyist work, radio ritual, encoding method, dust motif, patrol threat, all in ~790 words). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong; grammar and tense are clean. Minor overwriting: "thistled calm—sharp as the danger, peaceful as inevitability" is a near-paraphrase within one sentence, and "stories persist, stories return, stories written in dust and air cannot be burned" in the final line cycles through three restatements of one concept where two would suffice. The metaphor "captured fireflies" for dial glow is vivid but slightly incongruous with the established ember/coal imagery. No major line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating as the chair slows. Figurative language (wind through hollow reeds, powdered hands) is purposeful and sparse. Clarity is excellent; spatial and temporal tracking never falters. Minor deduction: "the paradox of finding beauty in dissolution" in paragraph 5 edges toward abstract philosophizing, though it remains anchored in the moment. The opening and closing lines frame and recharge cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence structures vary throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean with strong information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language (sedimentary layers, brass teeth, seafarer precision) integrates without overwriting. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Evidence that contradicted the Council's narrative" immediately after showing the same idea through nautical charts; "Ancient methods weren't just techniques; they were frameworks" restates the prior paragraph's epistemological claim. The template cadence "This was why he agonized... The Council couldn't execute him... but they could make him irrelevant" uses parallel construction that reads scaffolded rather than voice-driven. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and the prose is largely clean. Two issues lower the score: "denoting a principle" and "denoted belonging" recycle the stem from the required action, creating template cadence; "traveled stillness" appears three times (opening, middle, end) without evolving meaning, reading as ornamental repetition rather than charged motif. Information density is high in the opening third but thins in the summary middle. No paraphrase loops or major clarity issues, but the closure beat ("something ancient and essential had been passed forward") abstracts rather than concretizes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("scissors flashed silver in the tripled moonlight"). Some paraphrase loops appear: "She could taste what each cutting had contained" is immediately followed by a catalog that restates the same content. The phrase "something beautiful" recurs across three paragraphs without reweighting. Light filter-verb stacks in the middle section ("could taste," "could still taste") and one template cadence in the pruning sequence ("a memory of cruelty here, a moment of willful ignorance there") reduce density slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("skeletal finger," "sun melted into honey-colored haze"). Sentence variety supports rhythm and the opening/closing lines bracket effectively. Minor scaffold: "She revealed everything: the riddle, the pollen, the forgotten knowledge..." reads slightly list-like when dramatization might deepen the moment. The metaphor cluster around honey/nectar/amber is purposeful and coherent. No loops or template cadence detected, and information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specifics are strong ("pale as bone, still faintly fragrant with its violet-iris scent"). However, figurative density clusters without pattern-teaching: "hushed blaze," "quiet bay held its breath," "floorboards singing," "thresholds hum," "rooms expand with presence" appear in rapid succession without differentiation or escalation. The phrase "inadvertently profound" and "sanctifying its own history" drift into academic register. Minor paraphrase loops: "teaching itself to remember" / "help the house remember faster."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "coral threading through the cracks," "flowers opening in time-lapse," "stone hearts beating in slow geological time." Information density is high; most sentences advance revelation or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in "Marina felt the cascading revelations unfold" and "understanding finally displacing certainty," where the narration summarizes rather than showing the woman's cognitive shift. Sentence openings vary well, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are present. The "incisive kindness" construction recurs without mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. Minor scaffold appears in the third paragraph's "Three years ago—or was it three eternities" parenthetical, which pauses momentum to explain rather than trust context. The phrase "capturing what she'd lost" recurs in slightly different forms across paragraphs without adding pressure. "Boundless yet utterly confining" in paragraph three and "boundless confinement" in the final paragraph loop the same paradox. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with no filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (the brush's Tangut script, the landlord's compassion, the seventeen faces). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is controlled: "saffron quiet," "amber uncertainty," "moonbeams seem almost liquid" all serve the accumulative design. Minor overwriting: "methodically hopeful" and "amber uncertainty" feel slightly self-conscious. The transition from waking action to daydream lacks a mechanical cue, creating brief opacity. Closure beat ("continue proving that in this smog-choked city, strangers remembered kindness") is clean but edges toward summary. No major artifact penalties; high density with minor register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high without padding. Clear propulsion through the tour structure and no major loops. Two frictions lower the score: "rosewater dread that perfumed everything now, sweet and nauseating" stacks metaphorical vehicles (perfume/sweet/nauseating) that blur rather than sharpen; and "that spelled names, that spelled continuity, that spelled defiance" uses template parallelism at closure that dilutes impact. Otherwise clean grammar, vivid specificity (emerald-tinted lens, water-damaged manuscripts), and strategic telling that compresses transit efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; the yoyo disassembly sequence compresses three tide cycles efficiently. However, paraphrase loops appear: "latent radiance—energy waiting, coiled in time itself" and "radiance made solid, time made tangible" restate the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the workshop passage ("Coffee went cold. Rain hammered. Wind screamed. Silas barely noticed.") reads as list-like stacking (−0.4). Figurative phrases ("hunger stone emerged like a gray tooth," "trailing light like a comet") are vivid but cluster without pattern-teaching, nearing overwriting in the final third (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty totals −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive; sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor loop: "She'd been afraid of disappearing, but what if disappearing was the point?" restates the prior beat's realization without added detail, triggering −0.2 for paraphrase. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "silk dragged across broken glass" and "smoke, like possibility" are vivid. Template cadence appears once: "She looked like smoke, like possibility, like something…" (parallel stems across one sentence) but does not reach the three-sentence threshold. Information density is high; no significant scaffold or synonym churn. The final paragraph ("gloriously, impossibly alive") leans slightly toward elevated abstraction but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentence openings shift, but figurative density is high throughout without always serving immediacy: "fractal clouds," "recursive patterns," "geometric ghosts," "restless euphony," "agitated beauty" cluster in descriptive passages. The opening's "roots that had learned to drink from the sea itself" and "clouds sketch their prophecies" are vivid, yet the metaphor load in the middle third (fractal rules, resonance as instructions, tide as symphony) risks overwriting. Information density is strong—most lines advance situation or atmosphere—but the line "The orchard began to sing, a restless euphony of creaking wood and humming fiber, anxious but controlled, agitated beauty that matched her racing pulse" stacks modifiers without full clarity. No loops or scaffold; clarity holds. Deduction for elevated metaphor density in peak beats: −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. However, minor scaffold appears: "The expedition had been gone for forty-three days. They had descended..." uses a distanced summary opener when a tighter integration would increase immediacy. The phrase "pattern language" recurs five times, verging on synonym loop but justified by Mira's expertise. "She played Kade's whistle" / "She played the whistle again" repeats the stem across paragraphs without added pressure. Clarity and grammar are clean, and the opening/closing images anchor stakes effectively, but the scaffold and minor loops prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with some rhythmic variation, but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("truth was dangerous, so authority must recapture and contain it" / "recapture her narrative... bury her findings"), stock metaphors ("strangled by decades of ivy," "fingers from the past"), and template cadence in the reflection blocks ("The parallel was devastating... The Council had tried to recapture... Now she would recapture"). The closing paragraph stacks figurative language without fresh synthesis ("pit of lies," "whispers became shouts"). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate stakes rather than advancing them. No severe clarity breaks, but cumulative scaffold lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("columns listing like drunken dancers," "hushed blaze"). Information density is high and sentences typically do multiple jobs. However, several phrases veer into overwriting: "hushed blaze, silent yet burning with memory" mixes metaphors (a blaze that is silent), and "interlaced" appears three times, risking redundancy. "Wrestled it into the column's crack" introduces a verb ("wrest") that feels forced by the prompt requirement. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("He moved...," "He unscrewed...," "He tightened...") slightly flattens momentum. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in reflective passages occasionally slows the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences vary in structure and the prose advances efficiently. However, several text artifacts accumulate: "reclaimed stillness" appears as a repeated phrase in abstract context without dramatized pressure (opening and closing); "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" are descriptor insertions that feel templated; "honest origins" recurs three times as a thematic label. The phrase "understanding shifting through him like light through deep water" is poetic but slightly mixed (light and water don't quite cohere as metaphor vehicles). These patterns don't obscure causality but do create minor friction across multiple beats, triggering cumulative deduction in the −0.8 to −1.0 range per the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly purposeful. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("paper alone could not contain" / "something more permanent, more crafty, more true" restates without added pressure) and the stacked trio "descending while ascending, transforming while remaining, crafting light" in the final paragraph, which reads template-like. The phrase "dream-recording gems that captured sleepers' visions" contains filter redundancy. Clarity remains high; no causality break. Information density is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theory. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("The concentration was growing") punctuate longer exploratory sentences. Two frictions: "bleak exhilaration" appears identically twice (label loop), and "the physics of small disturbances revealing hidden structures" reads as scaffold exposition mid-beat. The geode's "facets dig into scarred skin" and "observing drifted three miles above" anchor concretely. Propulsion is strong through the final sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "pockets of brilliant dimness" is a strained oxymoron, and "brilliant points in gathering dimness" repeats the light/dark motif without fresh charge. "Perpetually surprised" appears three times as a template phrase. The phrase "not quite a question" and "surprised again despite herself" are near-synonym loops. Two instances of "by following star trails" within close proximity (title echo) read as scaffolding rather than purposeful reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong with good information density and varied syntax. The opening "Maren had made a career from rewriting the past, but she could not rewrite her own conscience" establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is purposeful (tapestry, threads, weight). Two issues lower the score: "under the weight of unspoken words that illness would soon make permanent" in the Iris paragraph creates mild opacity—the construction buries the time pressure. Second, the phrase "haloed by the failing light" deploys a stock visual at a key entrance beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; propulsion is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in key beats (the drawer pull's backstory compressed into three sentences). Minor scaffold: "This was neutral territory" followed immediately by dash-elaboration reads slightly explanatory; "This too was part of their method" and "This is where we untether" create a template cadence of demonstrative pronouns across the middle section. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("storms had stripped away all pretense of ownership," "moon continued its patient arc") is consistent and legible. The final image—lights flickering like uncertain stars—recharges the opening mist and storm motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Opening and closing images (cracked compass, kayak cutting north, utility poles as sentinels) frame cleanly. Two deductions: "merrily melancholic" recurs three times, creating a minor template echo, and the phrase "flickering faith written across her features" in the attendant's gaze reads as externalized label rather than dramatized perception. The gravitational metaphor is extended but coherent. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but the recurrence of the titular phrase and one filter-verb cluster ("seemed to say") in a charged beat slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the newspaper-clue paragraph. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. "Delicately robust" appears twice with intentional reweighting. Minor issue: "The labyrinth of choices began there" tells the thematic frame rather than showing it through Maya's tactics, but the phrase doesn't obscure causality. Figurative language is controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or metamorphosis. The spice-conjuring sequence is vivid and propulsive. However, the piece contains noticeable paraphrase loops: "changed but still herself" / "transformed but enduring" / "reluctance and longing" repeat the same thematic claim across multiple beats without adding pressure. The final two paragraphs summarize what has already been shown ("had discovered what the beasts had always known," "had become a bridge") in ways that dull the closure image rather than sharpening it. Template cadence appears in several "She had..." constructions. While clarity is maintained, the repetitive thematic restatements and summary beats reduce momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful with strong imagery: "veils of starlight," "clouds dense as marble," "lightning-bolt fracture." Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. Minor overwriting appears in the opening ("onyx-ink cartomancer climbed through veils of starlight") and in stacked metaphors ("choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest, made breathing an act of deliberation"), but these remain voice-motivated and legible. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. The final image ("rushed downward through the thinning darkness, hurrying home") uses near-synonyms ("rushed," "hurrying") in close proximity, a small momentum drag, but the closure beat itself is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("Today they would stitch.") pace the reflective beats, longer accumulative sentences build the stitching sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loop: "The photographs began to ripple like water, and behind them, Ren glimpsed something vast and dark—the locked dimension where humanity had retreated, or been pulled, or had chosen to go. The place beyond this last thin reality." The second sentence paraphrases "locked dimension" without adding pressure; trim would tighten. No significant filter stacks or template cadence; propulsion holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is often sharp ("volcanic glass still warm," "hot and granular and alive"). The piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "loss and creation are the same texture" restates the transformation premise multiple times without adding pressure, and "she had been wealthy and became destitute" recaps prior exposition. Stock metaphors ("sugar in rain") and filter-verb reliance ("she'd noticed patterns," "she was beginning to suspect") dull immediacy in key beats. The final paragraph stacks summary and thematic declaration where image would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is largely clean with strong concrete details (bronze quill holder, gnomon, coded angles). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the piece effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "secrets were merely puzzles" echoed by "silent revolution...written in angles only the vigilant could read, locked in codes only the patient could break" in the final paragraph. The phrase "cradle of sparks" and its variants recur without added pressure. Some filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "she'd left," "she'd discovered") slightly dull immediacy in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the rock-placing sequence. Minor loops: "The aurora pulsed above, its rhythm matching her heartbeat" closely echoes "The aurora sang overhead" in tone without added pressure. "Being elusive had become survival" and later "Kaela remained elusive" restate the same anchor. Figurative language in most sentences of the closure beat (threads of light, eels shifting, aurora singing, futures narrowing) clusters metaphor without full clarity on physical vs. visionary events, creating mild overwriting (−0.4 in Q7). No causality break, so penalty remains here.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often evocative ("braille of survival," "ghosts finding form"), but stacks to near-saturation in key beats without always clarifying pressure. Template cadence appears in the opener ("climbed," "carried," "became") and paraphrase loops emerge in reflection blocks ("furiously tranquil, a state she had cultivated" then "Fury at the erasure, tranquility in her method"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, dulling momentum at closure. Information density is high but clarity occasionally blurs under metaphor weight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (cipher, duel, philosophical debate compressed cleanly). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong through action sequences. Minor overwriting: "dignified chaos" and "amber possibility" elevate diction in non-peak beats; "endless commentary" (brook) and "ancient soliloquy" (brook again) repeat the same figurative vehicle for the same object without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's "steady as philosophy itself" mixes registers slightly. Propulsion remains intact, but figurative density in descriptive beats trends decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery: "diamond-sharp stars," "soil spilling from drawers that once held order," "the coffee tin sits open on a shelf, its false bottom revealed." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and paragraphs break at natural pressure points. Minor scaffold appears in "They work through the night… They've posted a sign… The first visitors arrive" sequence, which lists accomplishments rather than dramatizing beats. No loops or register drift mar the closure. Information density is high; every image advances the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "invisible" and "overlooked" recur across adjacent beats without added pressure; "flickering compasses" and "shimmer" are restated. Template cadence in the arbor section: "As he played... As he played... As the final light..." runs three "As" openers in close succession. The metaphor "doorways of pure light between scenes" is vivid, but "refused to collapse into sentimentality" in the arbor beat tells what the prose should show. Minor artifact penalties accumulate but don't obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Information density is high: most lines advance situation, character knowledge, or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly, and the final image ("roots reaching deep into the collective dreaming") recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining. Minor register drift with "empirically whimsical" as a repeated phrase, but it doesn't obscure causality. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks detectable. Strong line-level execution throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many images are vivid ("honey dripping from a spoon," "something dredged from deep water"). However, multiple phrases loop conceptually: "tides of remembrance" recurs without added meaning, "rhythmically placid" appears twice in identical phrasing, and the penultimate paragraph summarizes the epiphany already shown. Template cadence in dialogue tags ("came a voice, slow and measured") and filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase loop: "severance wasn't the storm—it was every moment they'd both waited" directly restates the prior reflection without pressure gain. Deductions: −0.6 for loops and scaffold, −0.3 for filter stacks in the revelation beat.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Figurative language (e.g., dust as a “geological record of disaster compressed into centimeters”) is apt and controlled, avoiding purple overreach. There are no obvious loops, syntactic tics, or line-level artifacts that slow momentum or cloud the closure. The slight exposition in the last sentences is more about thematic directness than prose weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and multi-function sentences that advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the frost tracing “invisible streams beneath the surface”). Metaphoric language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, with recurring motifs (glass, fire, frost, breath) rather than scattered ornament. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A couple of explicitly aphoristic sentences flatten the lyricism slightly, but they don’t materially obscure the closure or flow.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and a high ratio of meaningful detail to words; nearly every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (cathedral, topographical maps, ghost frequency) without piling into purple excess. There are no evident loops, scaffold sentences, or clumsy transitions, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image. At this length and ambition, a touch more compression in a couple of explanatory lines could heighten propulsion, but the line-level craft is already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient for its lyricism: images like “wrapped in kelp and sealed with barnacles” or “books floated in their cases” carry worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Rhythm varies, and most sentences multitask (advancing setting, concept, and emotional state) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is rich but not so dense as to blur clarity, and there are no major looped or template phrases. A slight tightening in a couple of summary-like lines about her past stubbornness could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise; sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Occasional figurative turns are effective and not overstacked, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Some lines lapse into generic abstraction (“build something that can survive any winter,” “the willingness to sustain one another through the darkness”), which slightly dulls the impact of otherwise sharp images. Still, momentum is well maintained from start to finish and the closure image of the bell and shared work lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, clean syntax, and dense but generally precise imagery (“like ink in water, like stars in fog”) that serves mood and concept. There are occasional brushes with purple or stacked metaphor (“bloomed eternal,” some fog/light layering) but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. The piece avoids repetition and scaffolding, and almost every line does multiple jobs. It reads as polished and magazine-ready with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with information, and mostly avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful (“watercolor on wet paper,” “doorway between two mirrors”), supporting both atmosphere and theme. The prose skirts the edge of purple in places, but clarity at key beats (finding the fragment, entering the center, dissolving) is never lost. Minor overrichness in metaphor density is the only notable restraint on a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images generally doing multiple jobs (e.g., chains as both history and present constraint). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and controlled, and there is little scaffolding or repetition. A few lines flirt with purple or slogan-like phrasing (“plant resilience in dry soil,” “staggering grace”) yet they remain legible and thematically aligned. Momentum is maintained throughout without notable loops or padding.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful figurative language, and very few redundant or scaffolding lines. Metaphors (“time moved differently at this depth—seconds stretched like kelp in current”) are vivid yet coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme). There is some lushness, but it stops short of purple; rhythm and clarity are preserved throughout, including at the close. I see no significant loops, artifacts, or figurative muddles that impede momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with good sentence variety and multi-functional lines that advance setting, mood, and theme simultaneously. Metaphor choices are generally coherent and on-theme (doors, thresholds, seeds of light), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. A handful of lines in the last third verge on platitudinous abstraction, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp imagery, but they don’t obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that often do double duty for setting and theme. Phrases like “quiet violence of ice surrendering to warmth” and “winter’s architecture collapsing, spring’s beginning” are evocative without being opaque. There are a few slightly familiar constructions (“weighty lightness,” “a world unmake itself”) and moments where abstraction edges toward mild overstatement, but they don’t materially dull clarity or momentum. The piece maintains good information density and avoids redundancy or scaffolding loops.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that generally pull multiple duties (e.g., “skeletal orange fingers” marries setting and unease). There are few redundancies, and most lines advance either plot, character, or atmosphere without slack. A handful of phrases edge toward thematic or emotional telling (“transformative betrayal crystallized,” “vulnerability into the firmest foundation of all”), flirting with abstraction. These don’t derail clarity or momentum, but they blunt the edge of otherwise sharp prose enough to keep it just below elite-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, high information density, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, returning to a few core materials (gold, amber, stone, silence) instead of spinning out unchecked. There is a slight risk of over-saturation in the figurative language around hush and texture, but clarity and momentum remain intact. The final lines land cleanly as an image rather than collapsing into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong image-making (e.g., the violin’s frost patterns “like sheet music written in a language of pure cold”) and minimal redundancies; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) efficiently. Rhythm varies well between descriptive passages and more abstract reflections, and syntax remains clear despite conceptual density. There is a mild tendency to stack abstractions in the explanatory sections about thought and accumulation, which slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, the line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“translucent tiles catching the lamplight in fractured rainbows,” “each fragment clear and undeniable”) and efficient, mostly lean sentences that carry both mood and information. Rhythm varies well between description and dialogue, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases edge into mild purple or redundancy (“ambiguously clear in their intention,” some slogan-like lines in the climax), which slightly dulls the sharpness at peak beats. Nonetheless, line-level craft is clearly above-average and rarely obscures sense.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in structure, dense with information, and generally do more than one job (world, character, theme) without padding. Figurative language is selective and coherent, with recurring images (cracks, veins, withering/blooming) staying grounded in the physical scene. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn, and the rhythm carries momentum through to the final image. A few abstract thematic statements could be trimmed or made more oblique for even greater sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“cold light that somehow radiated warmth,” “reality briefly translucent”) and generally efficient sentences that pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). There is some tendency toward repeated structures and a slightly abstract register in the physics explanation, but clarity remains high and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. A touch more syntactic compression around key beats could heighten propulsion into and through the discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character) without bloat. Figurative language (“where silence should live,” “language of absence”) is apt and thematically integrated, rarely tipping into purple. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and prose maintains momentum even while being descriptive. A few lines edge toward over-explanation of insight, but they don’t significantly dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that generally pull double duty (e.g., the smudge as both physical accident and thematic bruise). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; almost every line either advances emotional stakes or sharpens motif. A few phrases verge on overtly emblematic or expository (“Truth lives in the edges,” “certainties killed her”), nudging toward mild overstatement in an otherwise finely tuned piece. The final paragraph lands cleanly, with the ballast metaphor providing a resonant and clear closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight, vivid, and mostly free of scaffolding; metaphors like “darkness thick as wool” and “truth settling…like sediment” are apt and non-redundant. Sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and plot) without clogging momentum, and there’s good syntactic variety. A few explanatory lines feel slightly on-the-nose, but they don’t materially harm clarity or the power of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, and mood) with strong verbs and concrete nouns. A few sentences verge on purple or slightly redundant abstraction (“spaces between moments,” “endless conversation she had learned to hear as music”), which mildly slows momentum in a short piece. Still, figurative language is mostly coherent and aligned with the story’s conceptual field, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraphs land with clarity and a clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is clean, with varied sentence structure and strong information density; most sentences do double duty for mood and narrative function. Metaphors like “hush of dreaming roots” are evocative but not overstacked, and descriptive passages rarely stall momentum. There is mild repetition of key abstractions (“wonder,” “magic”) that slightly blunts their power but does not materially harm the closure beat. Grammar, syntax, and pacing are solid and professional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: rich imagery and metaphor mostly double as worldbuilding or thematic work rather than decorative flourish. There is little to no scaffolding, synonym loops, or muddled comparisons, and syntax supports a slow, contemplative pace that fits the story. Information density is high without obscuring meaning, and the final sentence neatly recharges earlier motifs. Occasional stacked abstractions are present but do not materially hurt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and generally lean, with metaphors (“with the same care a jazz musician transposes a melody into a new key”) doing double duty for character and theme. Sentence rhythm varies well; there’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and exposition is compressed efficiently into the bar conversation. A few thematic sentences in the last paragraph skate close to over-articulation but don’t quite tip into purple or repetitive. Line-level craft is clearly above-average and publishable without heavy editing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and few wasted lines; images like “three realities pressed against one another like nervous strangers in an elevator” are vivid and apt. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive, and key metaphors (silence as architecture, white as all colors) are coherent and thematically pointed. There is slight repetitiveness around phrases like “unraveled stillness” and occasional explanatory sentences that restate what the scene already shows. These are minor; they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (advancing image, character, and theme simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent—the spiral and music metaphors reinforce rather than compete. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences; the prose moves forward with steady momentum despite its reflective mode. A few familiar turns (“time moved like honey”) slightly soften the edge, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean yet evocative; images like “existing only between the drop and the ripple” or “a recursion with no base case” do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, and mood). There is some conceptual repetition around “infinite timelines,” “labyrinth,” and “periodically eternal,” but it largely reads as deliberate motif rather than scaffold. Syntax varies, and the narrative maintains momentum despite being meditation-heavy, with few genuine loops or clotted metaphors. A touch of trimming on explanatory sentences (“The procedural generation was merciless in its thoroughness”) could further tighten the line-level without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally lean, clear, and purposeful, often doing double-duty with atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to blur sense, and there are few if any obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Some thematic lines tip toward explanation rather than image-driven implication, which modestly softens impact. Overall, the prose would meet line-level expectations at a strong literary venue with minimal trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, precise, and mostly economical: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or theme, and sensory choices are purposeful. There is little in the way of repetition, scaffolding, or awkward metaphor, and the syntax has a gentle variety that suits the contemplative tone. The density of abstract nouns and thematic language rises in the final third (“integrity,” “complexity,” “completeness”), slightly thinning immediacy compared to the tactile early lines. Still, line-level craft is above publishable threshold with no artifacts that obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and evocative but controlled figurative language (e.g., “a mausoleum of extinct blooms,” “a lantern he would tend until his own light dimmed”). There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or synonym loops; most lines do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). A few abstractions in the explanatory paragraph slightly blunt the edge of the images, but not enough to damage momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, varied in length, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“visual echoes of their presence,” “koans written in light and stone”) is generally apt and not overstacked, and there are no mixed metaphors that muddy sense. Prose serves both atmosphere and theme while remaining clear at the climax and closure image. The main ceiling is that a few abstractions could be grounded more physically to heighten immediacy, but they do not impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and concrete images (“crown of rust and barnacles,” “water covered the floor ankle-deep”) that usually do more than one job. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent with the sound/echo motif; it rarely feels purple or redundant. Momentum is appropriate to a quiet, accumulative piece and there are few, if any, scaffold or paraphrase loops. The final lines land cleanly with a precise image (“turning rust to gold”) that recharges earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty with sensory detail and thematic suggestion. A few phrases and ideas recur in slightly paraphrased form (e.g., “professionally thorough,” “half truths”), and there’s occasional mild over-explanation of concepts already dramatized, which softens momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded, though the color-coding of emotions edges toward explicit systemization rather than subtle metaphor. Overall, the line-level work is strong and publishable with only light tightening rather than any fundamental rewrite.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is clear, fluid, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence contributes to character, setting, or theme. Occasional lyric touches (“the music that had always played beneath everything”) are controlled and legible, not muddled or overwrought. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to keep rhythm, and there are no noticeable grammatical or logical stumbles. The slight tilt toward sentimental phrasing in the last paragraph is a tonal choice rather than a craft error, so it only modestly tempers the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that mostly do double duty (worldbuilding + emotion). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, rarely feeling like decorative overload. There are minor instances of conceptual redundancy (“forever separate, forever outside”) and slightly purple turns that could be tightened without loss. Overall momentum is well-maintained for a lyric piece, and the final lines land cleanly without syntactic muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is inventive (“borrowed time…hummed in the air like trapped insects”), sentences vary in rhythm, and almost every line advances atmosphere, world, or concept. While the prose is lush, it largely avoids purple excess; metaphors cohere with the established physics of time and sound, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The pacing breathes appropriately, slowing in descriptive passages without stalling, then tightening around key actions like forming the time bubble and breaking the locks. Minor density could be trimmed for absolute sharpness, but it does not obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) without bloat, and images like “apples that tasted of patience” or tears filling mosaic cracks are fresh and coherent. Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined and pattern-consistent (mathematics, erosion, transformation), avoiding mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy and the prose maintains momentum despite being reflective. A few abstract formulations at the climax slightly flatten the otherwise luminous imagery, which keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that carry both atmosphere and character without bloating the prose. Descriptive language is lush but controlled; metaphors are coherent and never stack to the point of opacity. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or grammatical distractions, and transitions between exposition, memory, and present action are seamless. The final paragraph is cleanly cut, with the last line recharging prior motifs without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with concrete images and minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences carry multiple loads (character, mood, and theme). Figurative language (e.g., the caterpillar’s lacework, storm-torn rows) is apt and not overstacked, avoiding purple excess. A few explanatory lines in the final paragraph edge toward essayistic statement, which slightly blunts momentum and subtlety at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is strong line by line: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors (“sleep was a country she’d been exiled from,” “the rain came every third afternoon like a promise someone kept forgetting to break”) are fresh and coherent with the world and mood. Description rarely feels redundant; each image tends to do double work for setting and theme. A few densely figurative stretches risk slight saturation, but they don’t blur sense or undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do more than one job (e.g., shadows as both physical phenomenon and conceptual in-betweenness). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent, and the story avoids redundancy or obvious scaffolding. A few phrases lean toward familiar poeticism (“thick as spilled ink,” “cathedral of bright darkness”), but they don’t materially dull clarity or momentum. Line-level craft effectively supports atmosphere and closure without calling too much attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful; many lines carry dual loads of setting and theme (“air tasted of salt and forgiveness,” “the seabed itself had been rewritten by time”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The “navigated absences / cartography of what was no longer there” formulation edges toward conceptual repetition yet still feels integrated rather than redundant. The main ceiling here is that the middle research montage is told at a similar lyrical altitude to the opening and closing, missing an opportunity for sharper, more varied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences accomplish both atmosphere and progression without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme, with only occasional flirtations with purple (“certainty that trembled with life,” “crystallized silence”) that don’t materially blur sense. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum in what is essentially a quiet, accumulative scene. For elite publication, a slight trim of the more abstract or self-consciously poetic phrases would sharpen it further, but line-level craft is already above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is smooth, vivid, and mostly economical; many sentences do double-duty for atmosphere, character, and concept. The whale-and-star imagery and the idea of “unheard symphony” are handled with restraint, avoiding purple excess. There are some mildly abstract or redundant explanatory phrases near the end that could be compressed without loss. No major loops, mixed metaphors, or line-level artifacts impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and exposition. Some phrases edge toward the purple or abstract (“colors that had no names,” “spaces that shouldn’t exist”), but they remain legible and on-tone. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors that dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is controlled and vivid, with layered sentences that often do double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., “deathly vitality that bodies sometimes held in preparation”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; every paragraph either advances the situation or reweights the thematic frame. A few phrases (“impossible mathematics,” “spaces where honesty and necessity finally converged”) tilt slightly toward abstraction but do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are vivid and specific (“twisted through impossible geometries,” “codex of phantom moments”) and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors around compression, refraction, and texture interlock instead of colliding. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, register jolts, or syntactic monotony, and the prose maintains clarity while being stylistically ambitious. A slight tendency toward uniform lyricism in every paragraph is the only thing keeping this just short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with metaphors that mostly reinforce the central imagery of tides, containers, and sediment. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; nearly every line earns its keep. A few abstractions and repetitions in the last paragraph (“purpose,” “keeper of erased histories,” “toxic truths”) slightly thin the immediacy and tip toward slogan. Overall, though, rhythm and clarity are well maintained without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-shaped, and efficient, with a good balance between lyrical description and forward movement. Metaphors like “bruised twilight skies” and “crystallized like frost on glass” are vivid and coherent rather than overwrought. There is some mild repetition of conceptual phrasing (“universal riddle had an answer,” “greatest magic”) and a slight tendency toward summary in the final paragraph, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. Line-level polish is near publication-ready with only minor tightening needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful, with minimal clutter or scaffolding; the prose carries good information density for the length. There are a few slightly over-neat rhetorical turns or conceptual abstractions that could be sharpened into image (“dual allegiance was tearing her apart,” “blueprints for survival”) but they don’t obscure meaning. Rhythm modulates appropriately between exposition, scene, and climax, and the final paragraphs land clearly without explanatory bloat. No major loops, mixed metaphors, or technical errors significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) without visible scaffolding or repetition. Imagery is generally sharp and coherent, and technical lists (of compounds) stay rhythmic rather than wooden. Momentum holds throughout, with no dead paragraphs or explanatory loops, and the final lines land cleanly. Minor issues include a couple of familiar or slightly purple turns of phrase, but they don’t materially blur sense or dull the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: clear syntax, varied sentence structures, and information-dense description that usually does more than one job. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. A slight tendency toward lushness risks slowing momentum in places, but not enough to blur sense or closure. Overall, it reads as carefully revised, with strong rhythm and minimal noise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and high information density without feeling cramped. Imagery (condensation as rivers, the lake exhaling mist, ice crystals from the falcon’s wings) is vivid yet controlled, with few if any strained metaphors or redundancies. The prose rarely loops or scaffolds information; nearly every line either advances the investigation, deepens setting, or reinforces theme. It’s polished enough for a top-tier venue, with only minor room to further sharpen a phrase or prune a slight echo.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density, with description doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Imagery is mostly sharp and controlled, and repetition of key phrases (wild hush, cobblestones, rhythm) reads as intentional motif rather than scaffold. There are a few slightly abstract or redundant moments (“Her motivation was simple, though the method was not”) that could be tightened, but they don’t significantly drag momentum. No major figurative muddle or template cadences appear, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or synonym loops; almost every sentence advances image, world, or tension. Metaphors are generally apt and not overstacked, with a few strong phrases (“crystallized prayer,” “cathedral of stone and shadow”) that deepen mood without obscuring clarity. Technical description is kept lean and intelligible, avoiding jargon bloat. The main limitation for elite venues is that a few lines lean on familiar formulations (“made her chest ache,” “more precious than time”) where a sharper, more idiosyncratic choice could stand out.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, clean grammar, and high information density with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Recurring motifs (copper light, lattice, hush, wolves) create cohesion rather than redundancy, and rhythm supports the contemplative mode. A few lines verge on purple or repetitively emblematic (“hush” and “copper” reasserted as concepts), but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closing image. Trimming one or two explicit explanatory sentences could sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished: imagery is vivid, sentences are varied in length and cadence, and most phrases carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). There is some density of metaphor (“voice…silk and arsenic,” “plums that wept mercury”), but it feels deliberate rather than purple for its own sake, and clarity is never lost. Redundancy is minimal; the piece moves efficiently from image to image without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. A bit of the explanatory dialogue compresses complex ideas into slightly abstract language, which marginally flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean for the amount of image they carry, and most metaphors earn their keep (“like the way water knows its course even through stone”). There is some density of figurative language, but it follows clear patterns (weaving, water, stone) and avoids mixed metaphors or purple drift. Redundancy is minimal, and each paragraph tends to add new information or reweight prior images. A touch more variation in imagery beyond thread/stone/water might deepen texture, but the current prose is already publication-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, precise, and rhythmically varied, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“Time had inverted this place—what was above had gone below, what was below had broken through above” is a good example). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler constructions. The summary passages are efficient rather than flabby, and transitions are smooth. It stops just shy of the very highest band because some lines, especially in the thematic wrap-up, tell what the images already imply, slightly reducing density and surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without padding. Imagery is precise rather than florid—the satellites in stained glass, hopscotch as code, letters as “messages in bottles”—and there are no noticeable synonym loops or scaffolding phrases. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive and reflective passages, keeping momentum in a largely quiet piece. A few abstract phrases (“futuristic nostalgia,” “human mystery”) lean conceptual but are grounded enough in prior images not to blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and mostly free of redundancy or scaffolding; lines typically do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (threads, maps, convergence) rather than piled for effect, and sentence rhythm varies well. Key beats, such as holding the embroidery to the candle to see a different pattern, read with clarity and momentum. A few abstractions (“adjacent possibilities”) recur slightly often for this length, but they’re still grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and layered images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and emotion (“roots twisted like frozen thoughts,” “melodies wrapping around Isla’s ribs like gentle hands”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not redundant; the prose doesn’t loop or stall. Momentum holds through the reflective and ritual beats, and the final paragraph resolves with a clean, charged image set. There are minor instances of elevated phrasing that edge toward sentimentality, but they don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional—often carrying setting, emotion, and theme at once (“Shared anxieties bloomed between them like night-flowering jasmine”). The prose leans lyrical but mostly avoids purple; metaphors are coherent and thematically linked to water, memory, and organic forms. There is minor redundancy in stating the thematic frame (“translate other people’s traumas,” “graft new meaning onto these old wounds”) where image could suffice, which slightly blunts impact. Line-level clarity and momentum, however, remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). Metaphor use is frequent but mostly coherent and unstrained, and there’s little overt scaffolding or repetition. A few lines edge close to over-explaining what the images already imply (“That was how she thought of this place, actually”; the explicit definition of “pensive mirth”), slightly slowing momentum. Tightening those small redundancies and trusting subtext more would lift the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and multi-purpose lines that carry setting, theme, and character simultaneously (e.g., “She worked in the pause between question and reply, that suspended moment when the garden held its breath before answering”). Figurative language is vivid but not overstacked, and there are no major loops or scaffold-like repetitions. Rhythm supports momentum; the story rarely lingers on low-stakes description, and transitions between conceptual and concrete are smooth. A few abstractions could be tightened or embodied further, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, with vivid but not overstuffed imagery (“seeds rattled inside like imprisoned thoughts seeking freedom”). Most lines do double duty, advancing plot/world while maintaining mood, and there’s little dead scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphoric density is present but controlled; recurring images (sparks, seeds, vines, towers) are clear and non-muddled. Syntax remains lucid throughout, including at the ending beat, so momentum and clarity are never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do double duty (worldbuilding and emotion) without sliding into purple prose. Phrases like “shyly unstoppable” or “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are striking yet clear, and repetition (wind’s song, stars, postcards) reads as intentional motif rather than loop. There are a few spots of slightly abstracted or expository phrasing around the poet’s mission and the armistice concept, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. The final paragraphs are especially clean, landing on concrete, unfussy images that carry the emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, imagery is generally precise, and most lines serve multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious padding. Recurrent motifs—glass, light, sound—are handled with control, and the rhythms of long and short sentences are varied enough to avoid monotony. There is some density of metaphor and adjective stacking that slightly over-embellishes already strong images, but clarity is never compromised. No significant loops or scaffolding dull momentum, especially impressive for such a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“glass ink well…like a frozen tear”) and good information density; most lines carry both scene and emotional weight. Figurative language is present but not so thick as to impede clarity, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few abstractions (“symphonies of truth embedded in what remains”) flirt with loftiness, but they fit the characters’ lexicon and do not blur the core action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and information-dense without padding. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned (breathing stone, fragile envelope), with no significant overwriting or muddle. There are no obvious loops, filler scaffolding, or mechanical cadences, and the prose maintains momentum even in expository moments. A few phrases lean slightly into comfortingly poetic (“fragile as hope”), but they don’t blunt clarity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight and intentionally patterned, with very few redundant or scaffold-like lines; most sentences do double duty in atmosphere and character. Metaphors—like the dust-mote taxonomy or “blooming with possibility and withering with guilt”—are controlled and coherent, not piled on. Pacing is good: description never stalls momentum, and the line-level rhythm adjusts at emotional peaks without slipping into purple. Minor overlaps in phrasing around dust patterns/hope-grief binaries are noticeable but not enough to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do multiple jobs—setting, psychology, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose sustains momentum despite its reflective mode. Figurative language is apt and internally consistent (grain as map, panels as “slow-breathing glass,” the terrace as geometry between memory and place), with no mixed metaphors that cloud meaning. There are very few filler lines; nearly every sentence reweights atmosphere or insight. One might trim a slightly explanatory phrase or two, but there are no notable loops or purple excess, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery such as “a map written in living architecture” and “shadowseam wonder” feels deliberate and largely coherent with the world. There is some tendency toward lushness and stacked modifiers, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or stall momentum at this length. Grammar and sequencing are clean, supporting a smooth read.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, metaphor is mostly clean and thematically aligned (sea-foam, crystal, vines, temporal swallow), and there are few if any redundant loops. Information density is high; almost every sentence advances world, mood, or theme simultaneously. A few abstractions could be trimmed (“beautiful, essential, and heartbreakingly temporary” echoes ideas already implied), but they don’t materially slow momentum. Rhythm holds on a read-aloud test, and the final sentence lands with clear, uncluttered emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and economical, with strong information density: most lines pull double duty in atmosphere and character or concept. Imagery (e.g., “serenade monotony with creativity,” “calculated wilderness,” bioluminescent pools) is vivid without becoming purple, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Line-level rhythm supports the quiet, accumulating pressure, and I see no significant artifacts or muddled metaphors that would impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously—and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned (gaps, tides, quicksilver time, constellations on skin), and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. There are mild purple notes and a few abstract tells (“Her motivation crystallized with perfect clarity”) that slightly dull immediacy, but they do not materially obscure sense or closure. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready, if not quite at the absolute top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“mist that clung to the shoreline like gauze,” “cathedral of suspended droplets”) and efficient sentences that usually do more than one job. Rhythm and paragraphing support a contemplative tempo without bogging down, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases tilt toward conceptual abstraction over image (e.g., “capacity to teach what his grandfather had taught him,” “evidence of measurable beauty”), slightly dulling immediacy. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed to avoid occasional essay-like phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are clear, and most do double duty for character and atmosphere. Figurative language (“roof beam kiss his knuckles with fire,” “hard softness of that truth”) is vivid and largely coherent. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose carries momentum despite its reflective mode. A few stacked abstractions and slogan-like phrases slightly dull the edge of otherwise excellent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful; most lines carry multiple jobs (world-building, character, theme) without visible scaffold. Images like “parallel timelines brushed against each other like waves meeting in deep water” and “the serene upheaval wash through her like the tide” are apt and coherent with the setting. The main weakness is a mild tendency toward over-clarifying abstractions (“These weren’t mere ornaments but trial balloons,” “The formula emerged clean and certain”), which flattens the otherwise evocative texture. There are no serious loops or artifacts, but a bit more trust in implication would sharpen the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical, with strong images like “half-burned diaries spilled from its mouth like a confession interrupted” and “meaning compressed into pure acoustic form.” Most sentences do multiple jobs at once—advancing action, building atmosphere, and reinforcing theme—without slipping into redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely feels mixed or purple, and rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or artifacts that dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and there is strong rhythmic variety. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful (“where sound folded back on itself,” “mirages of hope”), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. Information is dense yet clear, with little redundancy, and the final paragraph lands cleanly on charged concrete actions and images. Any slight lushness feels intentional and does not impede propulsion or comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is clean, concise, and largely free of redundancy or syntactic tics; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or theme. Metaphors like the “slow dance of celestial bodies” and “operatively gentle” touch feel controlled rather than purple, and there are no confusing figurative tangles. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum, especially in the lead-up to midnight and during the ritual. While the prose isn’t aggressively stylistic, its restraint and clarity suit the material and show a high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (the egg’s shell as riverbeds; the lake turned into “salt and emptiness”). Figurative language is mostly sharp and coherent; repetition (“Four years of…”) is purposeful and propulsive rather than redundant. There are a few tell-y or slogan-like lines that feel slightly less textured than the rest, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closing image. Overall, the line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues, just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional—sentences often advance both setting and theme—without egregious redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors are coherent and patterned (threads, echoes, light) rather than piled on indiscriminately, and there are few if any mixed or strained images. There is a slight tendency toward repeated constructions and key phrases, but not enough to stall momentum or obscure meaning. Line-level craft comfortably meets high-market expectations, even if it doesn’t quite dazzle at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and generally high in information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing scene and deepening character or theme). Imagery is striking but not overstacked, and key metaphors (space, meteor hush, candles) are coherent extensions of the setting and stakes. There are mild expository patches toward the end that tell what the preceding scene already implies, yet they don’t materially slow momentum or obscure closure. No significant artifacts, loops, or syntactic monotony appear, supporting a solid upper-midband score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor is generally coherent, and nearly every line contributes to either atmosphere or theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few if any mixed or strained images. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose maintains momentum despite its contemplative pace. A few images (“impossible sky,” “ended future”) lean familiar or slightly purple, preventing this from cresting into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for setting and theme. Figurative language (snowmelt ardor, sound made visible, names made luminous) is vivid and largely coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some repetition of imagery and phrasing, but it reads as intentional motif rather than padding. Momentum is appropriate to a lyric piece, though a couple of abstract sentences could be sharpened into more concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally lean and effective, with strong information density: most sentences advance atmosphere, concept, and character at once. Metaphors are coherent and apt (“canopy overhead into a churning green sea,” “directive whispered in its dying voice”) without stacking into purple excess. There’s some repetition of key terms (“path,” “dreams”), but it reads as thematic patterning rather than scaffolding. Line-level clarity is high, and the final paragraph in particular has a clean, satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, purposeful, and carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) without bloating. Imagery such as “astronomers survived on rice and starlight” and “dusky harmony” is evocative without collapsing into purple prose. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and the final image of the morning star and extinguished candle is clean and effective. Occasional abstract phrasing could be sharpened, but no major artifacts or loops drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-paced, and economical, with a good balance of concrete image (“walls breathed with translucent uncertainty”) and conceptual language. There are few, if any, genuine artifacts or loops; most lines move story, character, or atmosphere forward. The prose does lean on abstract or pseudo-philosophical phrasing at times (“soundless truth,” “architecture of his sense of self”), which risks softening immediacy. Still, rhythm and clarity hold, and the closure image lands cleanly without being obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and metaphor that generally clarifies rather than obscures: “a translucent shape like blown glass,” “each droplet of mist a tiny sun,” “sharp and beautiful as glass mountains dissolving into memory” all feel apt and earned. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence. While the figurative language is rich, it remains coherent within a tightly unified image system (glass/fog/stars) and doesn’t tip into purple excess. Line-level craft comfortably meets elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is controlled and apt (“promises fell away like apple blossoms”) without veering into purple density. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; almost every line advances atmosphere or relationship. Minor quibbles—like the mildly self-conscious last-line wise-saying—soften impact slightly but don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, image-rich, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are largely coherent and unified around time, books/pages, and botany; rhythm supports the contemplative but pressurized feel. A few formulations (“brightened disquiet,” “simply complicated”) verge on mannered or slightly self-conscious, but they don’t significantly blunt clarity or momentum. Overall, this is near-ready at an elite level with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely free of scaffold or redundancy; metaphors (botanical language, harmonic shifts, symphonies of knowledge) are coherent and mutually reinforcing. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, giving the piece a musical feel that matches its content. There is high information density without sliding into muddle, and no obvious template cadences or synonym loops. A slight tendency toward abstraction in a few lines is the only minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences work on multiple levels (image, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (fog like breathing wool, emerald as defining green itself) are vivid and coherent, with only occasional near-purple moments that do not undercut clarity. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, supporting the slow, haunted accumulation of pressure toward the final shift. There is minimal redundancy and no noticeable technical errors or cadence templates that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances world, character, or theme. Figurative language (e.g., “reality seemed to hiccup”) is sparing and apt, avoiding purple excess. There are a few abstract phrases (“fables of absence,” “translate confusion into clarity”), but they are anchored in concrete action and objects. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, even if not aggressively stylistically risky.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is tight, vivid, and mostly free of scaffolding; nearly every sentence carries either image, world-building, or emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, and rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. There are no significant clarity issues or paraphrase loops, and the final images land cleanly. A few phrases border on lushness, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, rhythmically pleasing, and information-dense, with imagery that tends to be precise and thematically resonant (e.g., “thistle seeds… tiny parachutes of hope”). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every line either advances world, character, or motif. The prose occasionally leans into overtly explanatory statements about coincidence and meaning, which slightly dulls the lyric sharpness. Still, clarity and momentum are never obscured, and there are no significant artifacts or figurative muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Figurative language is lush but generally controlled; images like “solid fog rippled like muscle beneath skin” remain clear and evocative rather than overwrought. Redundancy is minimal and transitions are smooth, sustaining momentum despite the meditative mode. A few thesis-like sentences flirt with abstraction, but they do not materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are precise (copper filings, sulfur compounds, kerosene knots), sentences rarely repeat themselves, and each paragraph advances setting, character, or tension. Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. The rhythm supports the accumulative structure, slowing for atmospheric beats and quickening around the fireworks sequence. There’s little visible scaffold or redundancy, and the final lines land with clarity and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, clear, and economical; most sentences carry multiple loads (scene, character, and theme) without visible scaffolding. Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and shorter, impactful lines, and imagery is precise and grounded rather than florid. There are no obvious loops, mixed metaphors, or line-level distractions, and the closure image is crisp. A few abstract phrasings (“discover the texture of time”) lean toward conceptual, but they’re anchored enough not to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty in image and theme (“It tasted like honey and sounded like light, if light could resonate” is a standout). The prose mostly avoids redundancy and maintains good momentum despite a contemplative mode. A few phrases flirt with ornament or abstraction (“intangibly tangible,” “xenial trellis”) but do not accumulate into purple fog or obscure meaning. There are no significant loops, syntactic glitches, or figurative muddles that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that are both clear and evocative (e.g., “where the drifting prism terrace caught them like a hand catching snow”). Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined, with metaphors extending the sound/light motifs instead of competing. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or muddled imagery, and the rhythm suits the meditative pace. A slight tilt toward lushness in places keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical: each paragraph advances image, world, or stake with minimal scaffolding. Metaphoric density is high but generally controlled and thematically coherent (data, light, memory), with few clichés beyond minor slips like “her breath caught.” There are no significant loops or syntactic templates that drag momentum, and the final cadence lands cleanly. This is strong, professional line work, just shy of the exceptional compression and surprise of top-tier literary pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, psychology) and rhythm varies in a way that supports mood. Metaphors (e.g., “watercolor bleeding into paper,” “drowning on dry land”) are apt and not overstacked to the point of purple prose. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffolding or template cadences. A few phrases (“careful destruction,” “tend the flame with intention”) brush close to workshop idiom but don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean and efficient, with sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, worldbuilding, and character simultaneously. Imagery is strong and coherent (mushroom light, salt-crusted bolt, crystalline shards), and structural scaffolding is minimal. The main weakness is occasional reliance on aphoristic phrasing (“Pressure doesn’t destroy… It creates diamonds”) that feels slightly on-the-nose and reduces subtlety. Rhythm and clarity remain strong throughout, and there are no evident loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally tight, sensory, and purposeful, with few redundancies, and the prose carries both atmosphere and information efficiently for this length. There is some risk of purple edging (“golden shadows… shimmer and pulse,” multiple “eloquently silent” echoes, repeated sepia/golden imagery) but it mostly coheres into a deliberate tonal palette. The exposition about the mills and pensions is compressed and clear without devolving into infodump. Slight pruning of figurative density and a touch more variation beyond the golden/sepia motif would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious padding, and metaphors are coherent and controlled. Recurring phrases like “shivering bliss” and “unsnapped threads” work as motifs rather than accidental repetition, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or synonym loops. A couple of abstractions (“actual restructurings of what could be”) tilt toward conceptual vagueness, but they don’t obscure causality or closure. Overall momentum is well maintained for such dense prose.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence-level craft is tight: varied syntax, high information density, and images that pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language (“pressed between folders like a flower, like a prayer”; dust as “benedictions”) is judicious and coherent, with no evident loops or scaffolding. Transitions are seamless, and there are no rhythm-breaking artifacts or clumsy constructions. It stops just short of the kind of line-by-line shock of originality that would push it into the 9+ range, but it’s clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, concise, and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Imagery such as the puddles forming a “ghost geography” is vivid without becoming purple, and rhythm varies naturally. There is minimal repetition or synonym-churn, and no figurative muddle in high-pressure beats, allowing momentum to carry through the discovery and escape. Occasional abstractions in the closing paragraphs slightly flatten the line-level charge but do not materially impede propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually perform multiple functions (atmosphere, worldbuilding, and interiority) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with extended metaphors (light and sound as prisms, fog as memory) that stay coherent and support the concept. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or muddled images that obscure cause/effect or the closure beat. A very slight tendency toward lushness in calmer moments doesn’t significantly slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, imagery is fresh more often than not, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). The prose flirts with lushness but rarely feels overwrought; metaphors stay coherent with the established world (seeds, bone, ash, moss, transformation). There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the information flow remains clear. A few thematic statements in the closing stretch slightly flatten the otherwise excellent imagistic momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and efficient: sentences vary in rhythm, images are mostly precise, and description doubles as action or mood-building. Phrases like “swirling leaves,” “rainbow fractals,” and “rose beneath the ashes” are vivid without overcrowding the prose, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Minor stylistic tics—occasional abstract, lofty formulations (“machinery of cause and effect stuttered,” “beautiful recursion of mysteries”)—risk slight overstatement but don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, information density and propulsion are high for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density, with most sentences doing double duty in setting, emotion, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned (repair, balance, constellations, gold), and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler lines. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative constructions and shorter, event-focused beats as the ritual unfolds. A few phrases flirt with lushness, but they don’t materially slow momentum or muddy imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that generally do double duty (worldbuilding and emotion). Figurative language (“luminous ache,” “shadows pooled like ink,” laughter like “water over stones”) is rich but controlled enough not to obscure sense or pacing. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines either advance action or deepen atmosphere. A few phrases lean toward familiar lyricism, but they do not materially blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with high information density: most sentences advance setting, character, and theme at once. Imagery is clear and purposeful (e.g., “her body had become a precision instrument, and she hated every calibrated second of awareness”) without devolving into purple prose. Minor repetition of structural moves (memory surges, equation revisions) is controlled and avoids true loopiness. There are no significant artifacts, mixed metaphors, or rhythm failures that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus emotion). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding; the prose moves efficiently through a compressed span of time. Phrases like “elusively tangible” recur as motifs rather than mere repetition, and syntax remains clean without visible glitches. It stops short of the highest band because it rarely surprises at the sentence level or takes formal risks that heighten pressure, but there are no real artifacts dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with information doing double duty (setting plus character plus theme). Images like the ghost “flickering like a damaged film reel” and the mainspring as a “mechanical heart” are vivid without feeling purple. There’s minimal redundancy and no major artifacts or muddled metaphors. The only minor weakness is a slight explanatory tilt in the closing aphoristic sentence, but it doesn’t materially blunt the image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are very few scaffolding or redundant sentences; momentum is maintained despite the conceptual density. Minor moments of heightened abstraction are still clear and do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical yet generally disciplined: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, characterization) without obvious redundancy, and rhythm varies well. Metaphors like “built their halls like prayers” and “shard… remembered light” are vivid and coherent, with few if any mixed or strained images. A couple of lines come close to purple or explanatory (“What remained was this: him, the asteroid…”) but they still do work and don’t stall momentum. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic glitches to undercut clarity, especially in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors (“midnight…drunk the melodies,” “chip…no larger than a baby’s tooth”) are vivid without becoming muddled. The cadence on the page is musical yet controlled, avoiding syntactic monotony or purple excess. Explanatory moments are compact and anchored in image, and there are no notable loops, filter-verb stacks, or clarity stumbles. A few thematic clarifications could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors (“scent of time itself,” “stone patience,” “hinges of awakening”) are coherent and reinforcing rather than competing. There is some repetition of abstracted terms (mystery, awakening, wonder), but not enough to feel like scaffolding or synonym churn. Momentum holds across the piece despite its meditative mode, and there are no clarity or grammar slips that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images like the van “rattled like bones” are vivid, and most lines do double duty in atmosphere and theme. Information density is high without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops, and the rhythm supports the accumulative, contemplative mode. A minor weakness is some lexical repetition and abstract phrasing around “complexity,” “simplicity,” and “layered meanings” that occasionally feel more conceptual than embodied. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there’s no figurative muddle that blurs key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, imagery is precise (“honeyed pools,” “frost-jeweled refuge”), and description usually does more than one job. There’s little redundancy or scaffold; the prose maintains momentum even while luxuriating in description. Figurative language is fairly dense but coherent and thematically aligned with illumination and translucence, without slipping into purple or muddled metaphor. Copy control (grammar, pronouns, tense) is clean, and both opening and closing images are well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, many do double duty (world + emotion), and images are sharp without tipping into purple. There are a few abstract, Latinate clusters (“retrocognitively trapped,” “crystallized intention”) and some thematic restatement near the end, but they don’t seriously bog momentum or obscure sense. The prose avoids scaffolding and synonym loops; each paragraph adds new pressure or texture. With a slight trim of explanatory lines in the final third, it would read as fully publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, with high information density and minimal redundancy; metaphors are mostly precise and apt (“crumble like sugar in rain,” “fissures that spread like golden lightning”). The prose balances exposition and image efficiently, moving the story forward while building atmosphere. There’s mild risk of abstraction stacking in places (“concentrated potential, distilled possibility”), but clarity holds and rhythm supports the piece’s lyric bent. No loops or structural artifacts significantly dull momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and imagery that generally clarifies rather than obscures (“a translucent curl no thicker than a fingernail,” “a garden older than the skyscraper beneath it”). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose largely balances lyricism with clarity. A few lines lean toward mild over-telling of already implied ideas, but this is a small drag rather than a structural issue. The final paragraphs in particular are clean and rhythmically satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and emotion (“frozen now into a pillar of ice that caught starlight and bent it into impossible colors”). Figurative language is generally precise and coherent with the world, and there’s no evident scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence. Momentum never stalls; exposition is folded into image and action instead of pausing the scene. A minor risk is slight repetition of key phrases (“texture of borrowed time,” “wild serenity”), though it mostly functions as motif rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clear, rhythmic, and mostly tight, with evocative lines like “the cathedral hung suspended in the sky” and “listening had finally become louder than sound” carrying both image and idea. Explanatory patches about the rope-tower-foundation system approach didacticism but don’t significantly stall momentum at this length. There’s little in the way of syntactic monotony or paraphrase loops, and information density is high. A slight reduction of abstract restatement in favor of additional concrete, in-the-moment sensory beats during the climax would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, carry multiple jobs (image, mood, character), and maintain momentum despite a reflective mode. Most metaphors are clean and apt, especially around the lantern and meteors, with limited redundancy or scaffold. There is a mild tendency toward purple or platitudinous phrasing in a few lines, but it doesn’t obscure sense or the closure image. Information density and clarity are high, with no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (e.g., “wasteland pressed against every cracked window, its scorched breath testing the seals Silas reinforced weekly with melted wax and silence”). There’s a consistent metaphorical field around bees, glass, heat, and silence, and it rarely lapses into mixed or purple imagery. A few sentences tilt toward summarizing insight rather than embodied experience, slightly softening momentum around the climax. Overall, there’s high information density, minimal redundancy, and no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and often striking (“after ‘seven’ became a feeling rather than a quantity,” “smooth as the moment before sleep”). Figurative language is purposeful and largely clear; there is density but not purple excess, and information is packed efficiently into most sentences. A few lines verge on thematic telling or meta-exposition, slightly blunting momentum, but they don’t materially obscure the closure image. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, though not yet razor-sharp minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“red prayer of release”) and generally high information density—most sentences carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm of description vs. action is well-modulated for a quiet story. A few phrases edge toward the familiar or slightly purple, but they don’t obscure meaning or drag momentum. Line-level craft is well above average and fully serviceable for competitive venues, though not yet distinctive enough to be undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is clean, with purposeful sentences that efficiently convey worldbuilding, action, and theme without padding. Metaphors are apt and controlled, and there are no noticeable loops, awkward scaffolding, or over-written purple stretches that sap momentum. The rhythm is varied enough to keep the summary-heavy middle from feeling flat, and the final lines land crisply. It’s excellent, though not so stylistically daring or compressed as to reach the very top of the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, musical, and dense with meaning; figurative language (“forty million years caught mid-flight,” “bronze quiet”) is generally precise and evocative. There’s minimal redundancy, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding. The main limitation is a slight overreliance on abstract/philosophical phrasing in the final third, where concrete image could carry more weight than explanation. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and the closing image of amber, rain, tower, and fading footprints lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, often doing double duty for world-building and theme. Figurative language (“narrow vastness,” “keyhole that opens onto an ocean”) is vivid yet controlled, rarely feeling overwrought or redundant. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and description is tightly integrated with action rather than stalling it. A slight tendency toward lushness in every paragraph keeps it just shy of the very top band, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled and rhythmic, with good variation and minimal scaffolding; nearly every line adds either world texture or emotional charge. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to muddy clarity, and repeated motifs (distance, bones, wild hush) are deliberate rather than accidental loops. There are minor moments of conceptual redundancy in the closing statements about connection, but they don’t significantly blunt the final image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the piece reads aloud smoothly without algorithmic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and images that usually pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (“time-lapse film of eternity,” “arms unwinding like a cosmic clock”). The prose is dense but generally avoids purple excess or muddled metaphors; information moves forward with each paragraph. There is some conceptual repetition (pariah, true north, observation as anchor) that could be trimmed or more subtextual. Overall momentum holds for a contemplative piece, and the final sentence lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and economical: most sentences advance both image and story, and figurative language is vivid without becoming opaque. There are few, if any, scaffold or paraphrase loops; momentum is maintained from first line to last. The imagery clusters (bruise-colored sky, ice singing, secrets written in light) are coherent and not over-mixed. Overall line-level control is strong enough for high-tier venues, even if not yet dazzlingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and information-dense—nearly every sentence carries world, character, and theme simultaneously without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors are mostly apt and non-redundant, and there’s strong variation in sentence length that matches the meditative but charged tone. I see no significant loops or artifacts; the figurative language approaches the high end of density but remains controlled and legible. A couple of phrases edge toward familiar (“like electricity through water”), but they don’t materially dull the impact or clarity, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme often interwoven). Figurative language—books as mineral deposits, seeds as exiles—is controlled and coherent rather than purple, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Momentum holds despite reflection, as backstory and insight are compact and targeted to pivot the present. A few abstractions (“the hollow ache inside her chest”) lean generic, but they don’t materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are generally clean, and most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, and character) efficiently. Some phrasing (“fidgeting productively,” “woven hush”) recurs, but as motif rather than artifact, and the prose mostly avoids redundancy or mixed metaphors. The lyricism skirts purple at moments but remains coherent and does not obscure action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around bone, light, echoes, and guilt, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple bloat. The pacing breathes where needed and tightens toward dawn; the final sentences land with clarity and weight. A few abstractions (“complexity,” “singular truth”) could be grounded further in image, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “blue as drowning” and “each depression corresponding to a specific memory” are vivid and precise, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme). The prose occasionally brushes purple, particularly in compounded abstractions (“between meaning and void”), but it remains clear and propulsive. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors dulling the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, clear, and efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for character and atmosphere; phrases like “temporary eternity” and “intimately aloof” are memorable without becoming purple. There is minimal redundancy, and transitions between present action and memory are smooth. Occasionally, the language leans into slightly on-the-nose formulations (“she understood,” “a call to account”) that tell what the surrounding images already imply, which marginally dulls impact. Still, rhythm, clarity, and information density remain strong enough for near-immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with images that are concrete and apt rather than florid (“breath rattling like shells in a bucket,” “dew transformed each bloom into a confession”). There are minor patches of conceptual redundancy around the theme (whispers vs. shouts, purified intentions) but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. The final lines reprise motif without collapsing into pure exposition, keeping the emotional image in play.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and length, images are precise (“waning crescent hung thin as a fingernail scraping the sky”) without slipping into purple, and there’s very little redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most metaphors cohere logically with the world and mood. Exposition about the project and the floods is compressed efficiently into a few well-chosen lines. I see almost no scaffolding or synonym loops; tightening a phrase or two of abstract phrasing (“geography of catastrophe”) would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, purposeful, and often do double duty with worldbuilding and emotion (“their roots wrapped around ancient stone”). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and key metaphors (doors, orchards, storms) are coherent and sustained without muddle. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and grammar and pacing are polished. A few abstract phrases could be slightly more concrete, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance between atmosphere and forward motion. Metaphors like “softly persistent, like waves wearing down stone” are apt and restrained rather than piled-on. There are no meaningful loops, syntactic templates, or muddled images, and the final paragraph lands cleanly at the line level. A few explanatory sentences about the technology read slightly flatter than the rest, but they don’t seriously drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Images like “his shop smelled of old paper and regret” and the crystalline tunnel as “a constellation” are sharp without tipping into purple. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and syntax shifts appropriately with scene pace. A few formulations (e.g., “lingering promise unfulfilled,” “doorway of decisions”) are slightly abstract but do not materially blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, pull double duty in image and implication, and avoid scaffolding or synonym loops; almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is rich but coherent and rarely over-stacked, maintaining clarity even in the more baroque images like “lacy menace—delicate as frost patterns, dangerous as the blade beneath.” There are no evident grammatical slips or structural artifacts, and the final sentence lands cleanly. Only a slight tendency toward purple density in a couple of descriptive clusters holds it back from the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and vivid yet disciplined figurative language (embers like “lazy stars,” the spiral catching light “like a promise”). Most lines do multiple jobs—advancing emotion, world, and theme simultaneously—and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few formulations (“motivation crystallized,” “directed spontaneity”) lean abstract or slightly self-conscious, but they don’t stall momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tendencies toward thematic over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally free of redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors—“time folded around her like origami,” “being amazed by horror”—are fresh and support theme rather than cluttering it. There’s some risk of metaphor density approaching purple, but it stops short; clarity and momentum remain intact through to the final image. Minor tightening in a couple of reflective stretches could sharpen propulsion to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences flow, description is generally economical, and images like “tiny bells...like rainfall” and “trembling calm” succeed. There is some mild over-explanation and thematic repetition in the latter third that blunts impact, but no serious looping or purple-prose clutter. Rhythm and clarity are strong, even if a few abstractions could be replaced by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with images (“breath crystallizing like captured stars”) that are vivid without becoming purple or muddled. Repetition (“breath between storms,” frost, scars) forms a deliberate pattern rather than scaffolding, and there’s little to no synonym churn or filler. Figurative language generally passes the ear test and serves character and theme. A few lines edge toward explicit summary of emotional insight, but they do not significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is often striking (“dust motes suspended in amber light like frozen prayers”), and most lines do double duty for mood and character. The prose occasionally approaches purple, with dense metaphor clusters and explicit thematic phrasing, but clarity is never lost and momentum holds. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence earns its place. A slight paring back of overtly summary lines in the final paragraph would sharpen the closing image further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid phrases and a good balance between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones (“He had always been walking home. Now he simply knew it.”). Most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus theme, or setting plus character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. At times, metaphor and abstraction pile up (“spiral arbitration,” “arguments circling toward resolution,” “crystallized knowledge”), creating mild loftiness but not true purple muddle. Momentum holds through the lyric density, and there are no major artifacts that obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely tight and musical, with strong images like “where sea met sky in a line so precise it could split reality” and “liquid patience.” Information density is high: most sentences advance both atmosphere and theme, and there is little scaffolding or repetition. Some metaphors and abstractions cluster (“razor edges,” “boundaries of perception, not reality”) in ways that verge on purple but remain internally coherent. Rhythm and paragraphing support a contemplative, accumulating pressure toward the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Repetition of key phrases like “permeable barriers” and “physics of letting go” reads as motif rather than loop. The metaphor “quiet between them felt like wildfire” is striking and supported by the surrounding diction, not a stray flourish. I see no major artifacts or scaffolding; trimming a line or two of explanation around the therapy concepts would only sharpen what is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is precise, image-rich, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; metaphors are well-chosen and rarely feel strained (“moment of captured light before evaporation” is both clear and apt). Sentences carry multiple functions—setting, emotion, and theme—without bloating, and rhythm varies naturally. Figurative density is high but not purple, and I see no loops or template cadences that drag momentum. A touch more spareness around peak thematic lines could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally graceful and controlled, with strong information density and minimal redundancy; images such as “the kind of crying that waters seeds” are fresh and apt. Rhythm varies nicely, and paragraphs tend to do multiple jobs (world, theme, and character at once). There is a mild tendency toward repetition of key phrases and ideas (“loop,” “estrangement,” “teach endings how to begin”) and a slight sentimental tilt in the closing paragraphs, but not enough to seriously dull impact. Overall the prose feels polished and publication-ready with only small trims needed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, information density is high, and figurative language is mostly clean and purposeful (“cathedral of the overlooked,” “brittle ghosts” of modern ink). A few abstractions and near-repetitions (“endings and beginnings impossibly braided together,” then later “both permanent and fleeting, both unbearably heavy and impossibly light”) nudge toward purple, but do not obscure sense or slow momentum. The closure image—roses releasing fragrance as she carries laughter home—is precise and earned. There are no significant scaffolding loops or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, generally efficient, and often do double duty with image and characterization. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose maintains clarity even while being slightly lyrical, and the final image of the moon rock catching fading light is clean and effective. A couple of near-thesis sentences flatten what might otherwise be fully subtextual, but they don’t significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are generally coherent, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (e.g., “topography of unspoken longing,” “minor key that tasted of November rain”) is dense but not so stacked that it muddies clarity. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that slow momentum, and the final paragraph lands with a clear, charged image. A few abstractions could be tightened, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, generally doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or concept plus image). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler lines. The prose maintains momentum despite being reflection-heavy, and the final paragraph cadence works well. A tendency toward abstract phrasing in some thematic sentences keeps it just shy of top-tier, but line-level craft is solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are generally clean (“water like scattered pearls,” “hands seemed to murmur secrets”) and most sentences do double duty for mood and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple, and there are no obvious paraphrase loops or syntactic templates that bog momentum. A few metaphors (“silent orchestra,” “translate silence into music”) lean familiar, but they are grounded in the specific situation and not merely decorative. The final image of bodies mapping the harbor’s rhythms is crisp and recharges earlier motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme. There’s minimal redundancy and no major figurative muddle; the prose moves the story forward without getting lost in ornament. A few lines feel a bit explanatory or slogan-like (“She had burned the weapons aimed at Kiran’s life work”), which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp texture, but the closure image remains vivid and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, with only a few borderline purple phrases (“colors that shouldn’t exist,” “auroral sorrow”) that still align with the story’s atmospheric aims. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, speeding during the drumming crescendo and easing at the close, supporting momentum. A bit more restraint in metaphor stacking at peak beats could push this toward elite-level refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and generally high information density; most sentences carry character, world, and pressure simultaneously. Metaphors (origami, labyrinth, whispers vs. shouts) are coherent and not overstacked, and exposition is compact. There are no obvious scaffold loops or clunky transitions, and the prose maintains momentum across reflection beats. It’s strong, professional work, though it stops short of the kind of striking, sentence-by-sentence surprise that would push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong imagery (“cobalt dock glistened after rain,” “stillwater tension”) and good rhythmic variation. Most sentences do at least two jobs—advancing scene and deepening atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases flirt with purple or are slightly self-conscious (“spiralingly calm beneath the stars,” “patient architecture of light”), but they don’t obscure sense or slow momentum. No major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles touch the closure beat, keeping the final image clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that usually carry multiple functions (character, mood, theme) without overloading the page. Metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful, and there is little to no redundant scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A handful of lines lean toward the aphoristic or slightly purple, but they do not significantly blur clarity or slow momentum. The final paragraph lands cleanly with a charged image rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and internal state, with clear syntax and clean grammar. Figurative language is controlled and often striking, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few abstractions (“true nature,” “combative tenderness,” “furious love”) drift toward therapy-speak, but they don’t seriously blur the closure image or pacing. Overall momentum and clarity remain high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is precise and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs in image, worldbuilding, and emotion (“their blades carving silence into smaller, more precise silences” is exemplary). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, rarely tipping into purple or redundancy, and there are no evident loops or scaffold sentences. Rhythm varies well, and the final paragraphs land with clean, uncluttered images that let the earlier density resonate. A couple of metaphor strings (“joy was currency,” “processing centers”) sit close to overt conceptual labeling, but they remain vivid enough not to drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and striking but mostly coherent metaphors. Some figurative clusters (“ephemeral grace as shadows cast by passing clouds,” “as permeable as silk,” “lantern-moth hush”) pile up, flirting with purple but rarely obscuring sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances mood or meaning. A bit more restraint in the heaviest metaphoric runs could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is tight, vivid, and efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is selective and controlled, with strong images like the phoenix’s ash and the “warbling” bent reed. Syntax and paragraphing create a pleasant rhythm that supports the contemplative mood without bogging momentum. The main ceiling is that some late sentences tip into thematic exposition, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, not overlong, and most carry multiple functions (world-building plus emotion, or image plus theme). The figurative language around sound and light (“light fractured through the old glass,” “emotional landscape of absence and memory”) is vivid and controlled rather than purple. A few abstract constructions (“connection had texture—rough and smooth, hollow and full…”) drift toward generality compared to the otherwise concrete imagery, but they don’t significantly slow momentum. There’s no notable scaffolding, repetition loops, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is controlled, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. Images such as ash turning resin “cloudy, opalescent, like dawn through fog” are vivid without being overwrought. There are a few abstract formulations (“curtains of intention,” “quiet passion that burned without consuming”) that lightly glaze the surface rather than sharpen it, but they don’t stall momentum or obscure sense. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts appear, and the final sentence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and image-rich: “rain traced intricate patterns,” “lines of red thread connected them,” and the final comparison of rain’s laws to her grandmother’s measurements all carry real weight. Sentences generally do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, characterizing, and thematizing—without obvious padding or loops. There is some density of figurative language, but it mostly feels intentional and coherent with the pattern motif rather than purple. Minor risk: a few lines summarize large concepts (global adaptations of divination) rather than dramatizing, but they don’t seriously drag momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without bloat. Figurative language is focused and coherent; the mixed sensory descriptions of light and sound deepen atmosphere rather than muddy it. There is some conceptual redundancy in the final third where insights are restated in slightly different words, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or obscure closure. No notable grammatical or sequencing issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, precise word choice, and images that typically pull double duty (e.g., the smudge of condensation as both physical trace and thematic statement). The prose avoids major loops or scaffolding; most sentences advance either atmosphere or idea with good economy. There is some density of figurative and abstract language in the middle paragraphs that edges toward essayistic repetition about dream-share’s effects, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or dull the ending. Overall momentum is steady for a reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled and evocative, with strong verbs and precise, concrete nouns doing most of the work. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and paragraphs generally carry new emotional or narrative turns without redundancy. There is some mild tendency toward over-explicit summary in thematic lines and a few repeated adjectives, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure sense. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors interfere with clarity, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong, specific images (frosted hourglass, coffee rings as scars, ivy’s panic/joy) carrying multiple functions. Sentences generally do more than one job—moving character, setting, and theme simultaneously—without feeling overstuffed. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the piece maintains momentum despite its contemplative mode. A few thematically explicit lines slightly blunt the subtlety but do not materially harm closure or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and key metaphors (incubation, projection, thunder) stay consistent. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and the closure image is clear and powerful. Occasional abstract phrasing (“spatially imaginative farewells,” “dominant stake”–like constructions) could be sharpened into more concrete phrasing, but they don’t significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant, with high information density: most sentences do double duty, building both world and emotion (“light poured out—not the cold light of stars but the warm illumination of every unuttered word…”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Some phrases verge on purple (“liquid revelation,” “shadowed rapture”) and the figurative register is uniformly elevated, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. With a slight trim of the most abstract modifiers, this would be truly top-tier line work.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and nearly every line advances image, world, or concept. Figurative language is apt and not over-stacked; metaphors (specimen in amber, quantum foam) extend the core conceit rather than distract from it. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony, and the final cadence (“began, stubbornly, to bloom”) lands cleanly. This is close to publishable as-is, with only minor tightening possible in spots where concepts are reiterated.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-shaped, and generally pull double duty in worldbuilding and theme (“each droplet of condensation to a memory forming” is a good example of efficient metaphor). The prose occasionally borders on lush but rarely tips into purple or repetitive metaphor; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. There are no notable scaffold sentences, loops, or syntactic monotony, and paragraphing supports the accumulative escalation of understanding. It falls just short of the highest band because the language, while polished, doesn’t often surprise or cut with the precision expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are clean (“unused courage waited like unclaimed luggage”), sentences vary in rhythm, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors stay within a coherent shoreline/twilight/luggage constellation. Information density is high for the length, with nearly every sentence doing emotional or atmospheric work. The main ceiling is that some lines verge on prettiness over sharpness, but they do not obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do at least two jobs (world-building plus thematic charge). Figurative language is frequent but not purple; metaphors are coherent and anchored to concrete detail, and there are no notable scaffold loops or synonym churn. Rhythm supports the contemplative mood while still moving forward, and the final paragraphs land with concise, weighted phrasing. I see no artifacts that blur sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and dense without feeling padded; most sentences earn their place by doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or image plus theme). Imagery is strong and mostly coherent, and figurative language is not so overstacked as to blur sense. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts, and rhythm varies well across the piece. A few formulations (“gracefully, inevitably,” “guardian, then a witness, and finally an unmaker of lies”) lean toward the familiar, but not enough to sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, information-dense, and mostly do double duty (worldbuilding plus character or theme). The recurring images (tapping, currents, atlas page, stilts) are well-controlled and don’t feel like redundant scaffolding. Lyrical phrases (“periodically eternal,” “the ocean assembling itself into what it had always been trying to become”) are evocative without tipping into purple, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. Rhythm at the end lands with a clear, charged image rather than explanation-heavy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, character, mood) with little redundancy, and metaphors are vivid yet largely unmixed. Phrases like “thunderous serenity” and “sun-memory and star-promise” are ambitious but remain legible, and the prose mostly avoids purple overgrowth. There are no real scaffolding loops or template cadences dragging momentum. A few abstractions (“meaning in the mess,” “human grievance”) could be sharpened further, but they don’t materially blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) without padding, and the rhythms vary enough to keep momentum. Figurative language is apt and not over-stacked, with images like roots “clutching volcanic rock” and plants “screamed and sang” adding texture without muddling sense. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic templating; exposition is lean and strategic. A few explanatory sentences could potentially be compressed, but none significantly dull pressure or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, precise, and generally high-density: images usually do two jobs (worldbuilding and emotional mirroring), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. The extended metaphors (pearl of stillness, “body keeps score”) are controlled and paid off rather than tossed in for decoration. A faint whiff of therapy-speak and a couple of summary sentences shading toward explanation rather than dramatization keep this just below the very top band. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and momentum are strong and support the quiet stakes well.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and high information density with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (walls as fist, threads as spider silk, light as ache) are coherent and mutually reinforcing, not mixed. There is some tendency toward thematic abstraction and repetition of structures (“She would…”) but it rarely stalls momentum. Overall the prose supports both atmosphere and conceptual turn without purple excess or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and image-rich; most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, and character) without bloat. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or scaffolding lines. A couple of constructions (“consciously wild grace,” “cosmic emergency”) flirt with purple or abstraction, slightly diluting momentum in a short space. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong, and the closing lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images like “light traveling through frozen pathways like blood returning to sleeping limbs” doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Line-level clarity is high; sentences are varied and purposeful, and information density is good for this length. There is some tilt toward purple or abstract phrasing (“humanity’s frozen conscience,” “dizzying quiet”), but metaphors are internally coherent and not overstacked to the point of obscuring sense. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) without bloat, and there’s no noticeable scaffold or repetition. Figurative language (“held breath,” “engraved quiet,” “fierce peace”) is rich but controlled, rarely tipping into purple or mixed metaphor. Syntax varies nicely, supporting both atmosphere and momentum. The prose remains clear even at its most lyrical, with no artifacts that blur action or emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: images are striking yet mostly disciplined (“sound visible,” “birds in a frozen lake”), and sentences usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus emotion plus forward motion). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; transitions between sentences and paragraphs feel purposeful and propulsive. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and pattern-consistent, without mixed metaphors that blunt clarity. A few phrases verge on abstraction (“infinite acoustic memory”), but they don’t impede comprehension or dull the closing image, so momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are coherent and thematically linked to observation, orbits, and print, avoiding muddle or strain. There’s minimal redundancy and no noticeable template cadence or synonym churn, allowing smooth momentum despite substantial reflection. A few formulations lean toward overtly “crafted,” but they don’t obscure clarity or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and on-theme (sound, stars, light, entrapment), rarely slipping into mixed images. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; each paragraph advances the emotional or conceptual state. A few abstractions (“the dissonance that had lived in her chest,” “untranslatable, untetherable”) rely on concept-labels rather than fresh embodiment, slightly blurring the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong image economy (“emerged from the mist like a half-remembered dream,” “face crumpled and reformed, like mist finding a new shape”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences generally do double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and the rhythm alternates cleanly between longer lyric lines and shorter, anchoring beats. Figurative language is frequent but not piled to the point of purple; it supports rather than muddies. I see no significant scaffolding or loops that drag momentum, especially in the closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, mostly lean, and do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and key images are clean and memorable. There are no noticeable loops, clunky constructions, or copy errors, and momentum is well maintained despite reflective content. A few abstractions (“justice,” “redemption”) are named rather than embodied, but they don’t significantly drag the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with many lines doing double duty—advancing the concept while revealing character (“She’d done what she could—to lure possibility from the brink of despair, offering the gift she knew best”). Imagery is generally precise and evocative; metaphors like “moments intertwining like clasped fingers” and despair that “tasted like ash and sounded like a flat note held too long” feel grounded in her synesthetic frame. There is some density of modifiers and abstract nouns that edges toward lushness, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. I see no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, economical, and often striking (“fractually precise tangles,” “blooming and retracting like time-lapse flowers,” “delicate as willowglass”). Sentences generally do double duty, advancing plot while deepening image or theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors stay coherent and grounded in the story’s visual/technical motifs (light, branching patterns, bodies). Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum from inciting shock through to the resonant, image-based close.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and mostly purposeful sentences that advance both atmosphere and premise. Recurrent triadic structures and parallelisms create a deliberate rhythm (“between past and future, between sleep and waking, between the world remembered and the world becoming”) that supports the piece’s liminal mood rather than feeling like scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned without spilling into purple excess. There is slight conceptual repetition around Mira’s purpose, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“voices layered like sediment” is representative). The rhythm varies, paragraphs are well-shaped, and figurative language largely aligns with the world’s logic of cliffs, sediment, and fastening/unfastening. A few abstractions (“mapped centuries of accumulated miscommunication”) are less vivid than the surrounding lines, but they don’t significantly blunt momentum or closure. The final image with the hourglass and “sand fall[ing] differently now” lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, generally concise, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character (“patient as snowfall, persistent as wind”). Figurative language is controlled rather than overstuffed, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, though a few phrases echo conceptually (“unused courage…waiting here all along” appears twice in close conceptual form). The final paragraph lands on a clean, charged image that reactivates earlier motifs without muddle. A stricter cut of explicit thematic wording could further tighten momentum and let the imagery do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, mostly free of scaffolding and repetition, and densely informative without bloat. Metaphors (fog as percolation field for thought, palimpsest life, fabric/threads) are coherent and not over-stacked in any single high-pressure beat, so rhythm never bogs down. There are a few slightly ornate phrases, but they fit the established lyric register and don’t obscure sense. Overall, the prose would need only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-by-line, the prose is tight, image-rich, and largely free of loops or scaffold; almost every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (clay, kilns, entropy, light, growth), with no mixed or over-strained imagery. Rhythm varies well, and the repeated motifs (chimney smoke, sun patterns, thrumming) feel purposeful rather than redundant. It’s strong enough for elite publication but not quite at the “every line is uncuttable” level of the very rare 9.5+ pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with meaning without tipping into purple excess. Images like “protected from the wind but vulnerable to the tides” do double duty for setting and theme. There are a few slightly abstract turns (“protected vulnerability,” “collected radiance”) but they remain legible and don’t stall momentum. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or metaphor muddle interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful; sentences often carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character simultaneously). Metaphors like “clouds rolled beneath her feet like applause” and “breaking bones to reset them” are clear and apt for the emotional stakes. A few phrases recur (“brittle awakenings,” “atomically reflective”) and occasionally flirt with abstraction, but they don’t form loops that stall momentum or obscure meaning. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and crucial beats—the map discovery, final choice—are rendered with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, pull multiple duties (image, theme, emotion), and rarely waste words. Figurative language (“like a jewel emerging from silk,” “joy trembling at the edge of speech”) is generally precise and tonally apt, with no major metaphor clashes or density overload that muddies sense. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and the final paragraph’s crystalline imagery earns its flourish. The only restraint against a higher score is that a handful of metaphors feel familiar rather than startlingly new.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, mostly economical, and often vivid, with lines doing double duty for mood and information (“the pattern revealed itself like a constellation emerging from light pollution”). Sentence variety and paragraphing keep momentum through the technical explanation into the action beat. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity of cause/effect remains intact even at the peak. A few familiar constructions and metaphors prevent it from feeling truly distinctive at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are generally lean, varied, and purposeful, and most images are clear and apt. Occasional flourishes (“starlight poured through like silver rain”) flirt with the familiar but don’t stack into purple prose or muddle sense. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the climax’s complex imagery (“in all five corridors at once”) remains legible. Further tightening a few adjective-heavy phrases could yield an even crisper, more distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme, and there are very few expendable lines. Imagery (“bureaucratic amber,” “topology of murder/mercy”) is vivid and mostly coherent, and the closing image of “painting mercy into stone and shadow” lands cleanly. That said, figurative language is frequent and occasionally edges toward purple or conceptual abstraction, with some near-redundant formulations about opposites and seeing/being seen. Trimming a few of these rhetorical echoes would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and largely free of scaffolding or synonym loops, with good information density per sentence. Some images (“rusted sentinel,” “colors that shouldn’t exist at this latitude”) are familiar but still serviceable and tonally apt. Exposition is mostly well-compressed, though a couple of lines verge on summary rather than dramatization. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum without drawing attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that mostly pull their weight (“its surface catching light like a frozen raindrop”; the mesh fluttering to reveal silver names). A few lines edge toward conceptual density or purple abstraction (“luminous disbelief—that particular feeling when reality reveals itself as stranger and more generous than you'd dared imagine”), but they do not obscure sense or stall momentum. There is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or mechanical cadence. Overall, information density and clarity are high, with room to tighten a couple of abstract sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level writing is polished: sentences are generally tight, purposeful, and free of obvious scaffolding or redundancies. Figurative language is well chosen and not over-stacked, with images (velvet exhaling dust, fragile currency, territorial markers) doing multiple jobs at once. A few lines slip into more abstract, thesis-like phrasing, but they don’t seriously harm momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose reads publication-ready with only minor opportunities to pare back explicit statements of theme.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, syntactically varied, and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple functions (scene, emotion, concept) without obvious redundancy. Some phrases lean on familiar formulations (“understanding dawned with the actual sunrise,” “grief and guilt”) and the final paragraphs pile thematic abstractions a bit heavily, which slightly dulls the closing image. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, never slipping into purple or muddled metaphor. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for publication but not yet at a dazzling, sentence-by-sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is compact yet rich, with minimal redundancy and strong information density—images typically serve character, worldbuilding, and mood at once. Metaphors (e.g., “swirling orchard vortex pulse…like a malevolent heart”) are coherent and not over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately between contemplative and intense beats, keeping momentum without feeling rushed. Line-level craft supports rather than distracts from the emotional and narrative arc, with no evident artifacts or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, information is dense, and most figurative language lands cleanly. Some phrases push toward purple or abstraction (“pure crystallized possibility,” “living intersection of what was, what is, and what must come to be”) and slightly blunt the immediacy of the closing image. There’s minor conceptual repetition around visions, intersections, and covenants, but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus character).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and vivid but mostly controlled figurative language (“roots threading through ribcages and skulls like curious fingers”). There’s minimal redundancy, and nearly every line builds character, world, or stakes. A few spots border on purple or thematic repetition—e.g., “She would try. She would always try” and repeated “holes in the soul” framing—but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur meaning. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with no major artifacts obscuring action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is controlled, with varied syntax and strong information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing scene and deepening character or theme). Imagery is apt and not over-stacked; metaphors like the quarry as a hollow echo chamber and failure as an encore-less performance are coherent and extend the core concept. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; line-level rhythm keeps momentum despite the reflective texture. A few abstract lines skirt on-the-nose (“facts required no faith”), but they’re supported by concrete context and don’t blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished, with strong information density—lines often carry setting, character, and theme at once (“clouds rolled like thoughts trying to form words”). Sentence rhythms vary, and there are few redundancies or scaffolding phrases; exposition is compact and purposeful. Some metaphors (“aching beauty of change itself,” “reestablish the connection between ancient wisdom and modern grief”) are a touch generalized compared to the sharper concrete images, and the final moralizing sentence blunts the otherwise elegant close. Still, clarity and momentum are high, and figurative language is mostly apt and unmuddled.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and carry multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent, and there’s little to no scaffold or synonym churn; the prose maintains clarity even while it’s lush. A few phrases (“the capacity for wonder—that electric shock…”) skate close to abstraction but do not significantly blunt momentum or obscure cause/effect. The closing paragraphs in particular are rhythmically and imagistically strong.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images like “stone that remembered light” and “walls between hearts” are memorable without generally tipping into purple. There are occasional slightly overworked phrases (“tomb of panic and pragmatism,” “contagion of courage”), but they don’t stall momentum or obscure sense. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors interfere with clarity, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, character) with little redundancy, and rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language (“ivy cascading…like green waterfalls frozen in time,” “some objects were meant to be witnesses, not instruments”) is vivid but not overstacked. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics that drag momentum. The final sentences land cleanly, recharging prior motifs without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, packing setting, concept, and character into high-density lines without much scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“windows pulsing with amber light that seemed to breathe,” “books whispered…in languages that predated speech”) is vivid and controlled, rarely tipping into purple or muddled metaphor. Information about the world’s rules (propagation delays, cyclic time, echoes that form a cipher) is delivered cleanly via scene and dialogue instead of exposition dumps. A few abstractions (“time’s strange architecture,” “particular silence”) lean slightly generic but do not meaningfully slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong verbs, vivid yet legible metaphors (“bruised twilight,” “mulberry ache”) and good information density—most sentences do double duty for world, mood, and character. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure meaning, and images tend to be thematically aligned rather than ornamental. There are no obvious scaffold loops or clumsy constructions; the piece reads smoothly aloud. A slight tendency toward lushness could, in a longer work, risk overgrowth, but at this length it remains under control.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely economical: most sentences pull double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and emotional charge. Figurative language is clear and coherent (e.g., static as white noise, patterns as constellations), with very little redundancy or scaffolding. The rhythm reads smoothly aloud, with varied sentence openings and paragraph structures. It edges toward the lyrical high end, but without tipping into confusion or decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, and most do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme at once) without feeling padded. Metaphors like “scalloped pattern of their past lives laid out like shells on a shore” and “barnacles of resentment” are vivid and coherent, with only mild risk of piling imagery. There are no obvious loops or scaffold phrases, and rhythm supports a contemplative, hushed momentum. The prose flirts with lushness but remains controlled and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with few if any redundancy loops or filler scaffolding. Images (“dawn stained the horizon pink,” “protected vulnerability, raw and real”) are clear and largely unmuddled, and description integrates smoothly with action. The main ding is occasional overtly didactic phrasing that slightly blunts momentum by telling what the images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is strong, with high information density, generally clean rhythm, and evocative imagery (“lines around his eyes softening like erosion in reverse” is especially sharp). Description is purposeful and rarely feels purple; most sentences do more than one job, advancing atmosphere, character, and theme together. There is some mild repetition and abstract phrasing in the philosophical explanations, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or blur clarity. No major artifacts, mixed metaphors, or syntactic monotony mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, dense with information, and generally avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent, mostly orbiting sound, resonance, and accumulation; it seldom crosses into muddle or purple excess. Transitions are smooth, and the final line circles back to earlier imagery without feeling forced. A few metaphors verge on the ornate, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is controlled and purposeful: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and layered images that usually do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; most lines contribute to atmosphere, character, or forward motion. Figurative language is frequent but consistent in register and largely coherent, with no mixed-metaphor snarls or purple excess that obscure meaning. Rhythm is varied enough that the piece reads smoothly aloud and builds to a clean, charged final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and often multipurpose, advancing character, atmosphere, and concept simultaneously. Figurative language is mostly fresh and controlled (“cathedral of rust and barnacles,” “meteor hush”), with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There are a few slightly dense conceptual lines around the synesthetic “intersection of all senses,” but they remain intelligible and do not stall momentum. The prose could arguably tighten a hair in the explanatory journal section, yet it never lapses into clotted or purple description.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with generally clean syntax, strong verbs, and images that pull double duty (coins as both relics and decision tools, static as both noise and revelation). There is some repetition of key terms (“amber,” “static bursts”) but it reads as motif rather than artifact, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity is maintained throughout. The main ceiling comes from occasional reliance on abstract phrasing where more embodied detail could deepen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (dust as galaxies, crystals of light, monsters as grief-guilt-rage-regret) are coherent and layered rather than piled on indiscriminately. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates; momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A very few lines veer close to purple but remain grounded enough not to dull clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most lines serve multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Imagery around water, dripping, and memory is coherent and well-patterned, with minimal mixed metaphors or purple excess. There is some abstract phrasing (“cosmic machinery,” “conceptual balance”) that could be grounded more in sensory embodiment, especially at peak beats. Overall, momentum and clarity remain high, and there are no significant loops or line-level artifacts dulling the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean yet evocative, with strong images like “skeletal structures breaking the waterline like accusations” and “mirrored hush of the exposed lakebed.” Most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, character) without redundancy. A few phrases nudge toward purple or conceptual (“spin stories into shared meaning”), but they don’t significantly stall momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and dense without becoming incoherent; many sentences do double work for atmosphere and psychology (“The crystal was perfect—geometrically flawless in a way that made her chest tighten with an emotion she refused to name”). Imagery is generally precise and non-redundant, and there are no significant scaffold lines or loops. A few moments flirt with purple or slightly repetitive abstraction around “wonder” and “logic vs intuition,” but they don’t seriously drag momentum or blur sense. Grammar, rhythm, and sequencing are clean, especially around the transformation beat with the green flame.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise, with some lines doing multiple jobs (character, world, and theme at once). Metaphor use is controlled and not overgrown; “soundless echo of truth” and the leaves whispering in silver and shadow are apt. There is occasional mild redundancy and abstract phrasing around responsibility and trust, but no serious loops or muddles. Momentum holds smoothly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich (“cables that hummed with borrowed physics,” “grief and joy braided together”) and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well between descriptive passages, dialogue, and interior pivot moments, maintaining momentum. There is occasional abstraction or label-like phrasing (“ego death,” “built new walls,” “the sensation was overwhelming”) that could be grounded more concretely, but it doesn’t materially drag or obscure. No significant loops, clutter, or figurative muddle appear, especially not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically precise, and generally economical, with some well-crafted images (“the moment before dawn breaks or a solution clicks into place,” “storm-born silence”) doing double duty for mood and theme. Line-level repetition and scaffolding are minimal; sentences vary in length and avoid mechanical cadence. At times, diction leans a bit purple or abstract, but not so much that it muddies sense or pace. Overall, the piece reads smoothly and professionally, just shy of the compression and sharpness that would mark top-tier literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and motion) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language around sound, wind, and leaves is coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. The repetition of certain phrases (“gripped the pull cord handle”) borders on echo but reads more as motif than artifact. Momentum is maintained throughout; no paragraphs feel like removable exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally taut, with images doing multiple jobs (world-building, psychology, theme) and minimal redundancy. Metaphors are mostly coherent and integrated into action (“petals suspended in ice like thoughts,” light staking claims), with only occasional lines that edge toward over-explanation rather than fresh image. Momentum never stalls despite reflection, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and charged economy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—sentences frequently carry setting, theme, and character simultaneously. Rhythm varies well, and figurative language is generally apt and coherent (forge-rivers, frozen bloom, glacier destiny) without collapsing into mixed metaphors. There is minor risk of over-ornamentation in a few lines, but it doesn’t obstruct clarity or momentum. I see no meaningful scaffolding, synonym loops, or structural artifacts that dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-shaped, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and legible, with only occasional borderline-purple phrases that don’t materially obscure meaning. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; most lines advance either the scene’s action (tuning, listening) or deepen the conceptual frame. The main ceiling comes from a slight overreliance on abstract thematic restatement in the final paragraphs rather than letting prior concrete images carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone (“water that reflected stars despite the noon sun overhead”). Metaphors are apt and rarely overstacked; the recurring hourglass and maritime imagery create cohesion rather than purple excess. There’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn, and momentum carries smoothly through the explanatory sections. A few phrases and constructions recur (“resiliently positive,” “permanently transient”), but they read as deliberate motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and the imagery is consistently coherent. Phrases like “realistically imaginary” and “the actual woven substance of attention” feel fresh without tipping into muddled metaphor. There are no significant loops, syntactic tics, or clarity issues; the prose propels smoothly into and through the climax. A few abstract explanatory sentences could be trimmed or grounded slightly more in sensation, but they don’t seriously impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are clear, well-paced, and generally efficient, carrying worldbuilding, theme, and character simultaneously. Figurative language—“where light remembers itself,” “pressed down like history, like forgetting”—is striking and coherent rather than mixed or overstacked. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. A slight tendency toward abstraction in a few lines could be tightened, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or blur meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is clear, mostly economical, and carries good rhythm; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, premise, or plot. There are mild redundancies and a slight tendency toward repeated cadences (“The X…” sentence openings), but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no mixed metaphors or register jolts. The final paragraphs in particular balance summary and image smoothly, bringing the piece to a clean cadence without an expository dump.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, economical, and often multifunctional, advancing mood, world, and theme together (“crashing hush, crashing hush—the sound of the ocean above…”). Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked, and there’s little to no redundancy or scaffolding. Rhythm is varied and propulsive without feeling mechanical. A few generalized phrases near the end soften the otherwise sharp texture, but they do not materially harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and efficient: most lines do at least two jobs (image + emotion, or setting + theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphoric language is frequent but coherent and on-theme (ink as pattern, radio static vs. signal, breathing universe), avoiding mixed or overwrought constructions. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs, and grammatical control is strong; nothing obscures cause/effect or dulls the ending image. It flirts with being quite lush but stays on the right side of clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but efficient: most sentences carry worldbuilding, character, and theme simultaneously without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“choosing each word with the precision of a jeweler cutting facets,” “the language would live in the surfaces of the world”) is fresh, coherent, and aligned with the story’s logic. Rhythm on the page feels deliberate, with paragraph breaks that match conceptual shifts and a strong, clean final line. I see no significant loops, muddled metaphors, or mechanical artifacts that would dull momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “tears froze on her cheeks in the garden’s strange microclimate” are evocative without becoming florid. Figurative language is mostly precise and integrated, with only occasional near-purple moments in the more abstract declarations. There’s little redundancy or scaffold, and each paragraph advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The prose supports momentum rather than stalling it, though one or two thematic lines could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight and clear, with strong, concrete images (“voice like millstones,” “apples that might have once shone like stars but now held only the memory of luminescence”). Sentences vary in length and rhythm, supporting momentum through the discovery and escape beats. There is mild abstraction and repetition (e.g., restating purpose, reusing similar thematic phrasing), but it doesn’t significantly muddy action or closure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and imagery that is vivid without tipping into full purple prose. The piece efficiently braids world-building with emotional beats (e.g., the catalog of past deliveries) and avoids scaffolding or obvious repetition. A couple of lines restate ideas already implied (e.g., re-explaining what the storm “proves” about memory), which could be tightened. Overall rhythm and clarity remain high, supporting momentum in a quiet story.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, precise, and purposeful, with most doing at least two jobs (advancing action while deepening atmosphere or theme). Recurring phrases and images (mist, bells, halo, silence/song) read as deliberate pattern rather than redundancy. Figurative language is rich but controlled; metaphors are coherent and rarely feel strained, avoiding purple excess. There are no obvious scaffolding lines, template cadences, or grammatical slips that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that are both original and legible (“saddle-shaped surfaces,” “geodesics” of borrowing, the scarf settling into predicted curves). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels purple or incoherent, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases. The rhythm supports the contemplative mode and doesn’t drag despite the abstract content. A few explanatory phrases could be tightened, but they don’t significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that typically carry multiple layers of meaning (“honey poured through gauze,” “tiny oceans” in the palette). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and thematically coherent around light and water. There is some repetition of key terms (“light,” “longing,” “vitalize”) that borders on overinsistence but doesn’t materially dull the closure. I see no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle that would obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—many sentences accomplish setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is generally precise and integrated; motifs like stars, locks, and music reappear without feeling repetitive or purple. There are minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; rhythm varies well between long, lush descriptions and shorter, impact-heavy lines (“And now?”). A few abstractions (“careful narratives,” “component lies”) skim toward generality but don’t significantly blunt clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, character) and rarely feel redundant or padded, and metaphors (shards as stars, mushrooms as key/door) are coherent and sensibly extended. There’s occasional adjective and image density that leans toward lush, but it doesn’t cross into purple or obscure action, and the prose maintains clarity even at peak moments like the memory flood. I don’t see obvious loops or scaffolding, and grammar and sequencing are clean. It’s strong, publication-ready prose with only minor opportunities to sharpen by cutting a phrase here and there.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are precise, varied, and pull multiple weights at once—image, worldbuilding, and psychology—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (amber, glass, geometry, shadows), and the rhythm between longer lyric lines and short, cutting dialogue keeps momentum. There’s minimal redundancy and no noticeable syntax templates; each line feels chosen. The only restraint is that a couple of thesis-leaning sentences flirt with abstraction, though they do not obscure clarity or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: syntax is clean, images are coherent, and most sentences carry more than one layer of work (worldbuilding, mood, character). Repetition around “essence,” “wonder,” and “particular quality” edges toward abstraction but doesn’t quite tip into redundancy or purple prose. The rhythm fits the meditative mode, though a few sentences could be trimmed or made more concrete to sharpen momentum. No significant grammatical or clarity issues interfere with reading or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and image-rich, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“She discovered she accumulated silence the way others collected scars”). Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent; it rarely feels purple, and the metaphors cluster around water, silence, fracture, and weight in a controlled way. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum through a static physical situation. A few phrases (“interlaced hush,” “unfallen snow”) come close to over-poetic, but they don’t impede clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, imagery is coherent, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and character). Recurring metaphors of maps, silence, and absence are controlled rather than piled, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few abstract formulations (“space where silence became interpretable”) lean conceptual, but they remain clear and voice-appropriate. Overall, the prose has strong momentum for a reflective piece, with no major artifacts dulling the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in structure and length, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors (threads, tapestries, storms, patterns) are coherent across the piece and mostly avoid overwriting. A few phrases circle similar abstractions (patterns transforming, threads, attachment) in close proximity, which slightly softens momentum and surprise near the end. Overall, the prose passes the read-aloud test with clarity and musicality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of redundancy; most sentences do double duty for mood and information. Imagery is generally coherent and striking (e.g., “geometric whispers,” “painted code”) without slipping into mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s some density of modifiers and figurative language, but it rarely blurs sense or momentum at this length. With slightly more variation in sentence texture and a few trims to high-flower moments, it would be publish-ready line work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and often do double duty for setting and emotion (“evidence of love, scattered across pages like light through ice”). Figurative language is controlled and thematically aligned without purple excess, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. The floor-by-floor progression gives momentum and avoids reflection stalls. A couple of abstractions (“more permanent than sorrow”) could be grounded in image, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is clear, metaphors largely coherent, and most sentences pull their weight for both mood and information. Pacing and paragraphing support the quiet build without obvious scaffolding or mechanical repetition. A few phrases and ideas recur a bit on-the-nose (e.g., direct statements about wholeness and absence), edging toward thematic redundancy. Overall, though, clarity and rhythm hold, and there’s no figurative muddle that harms closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight and musical, with strong verbs and specific nouns (“cambium and heartwood,” “fractally precise star charts”) doing double duty for world-building and theme. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most carry multiple pieces of information without feeling padded. There is a mild tendency toward repetition of key conceptual phrases (“fractally precise,” “mirror the sky/infinity”) and direct explanatory sentences that slightly reduce compression. Still, there are no serious loops or mixed metaphors, and the line-level craft is clearly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is tight, concrete, and rhythmic, with images like “luminous dead air” and “stranded luminance dissipate like morning fog” doing efficient double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding loops or scaffold, and almost every line advances character, setting, or plot. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and clarity is never compromised, including at the moment of the ship’s shudder and release. The style is strong and controlled, if more accomplished than startling.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and mostly high-density: images often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Phrases such as “hauntingly bright luminescence” and “time showed its inner workings” are vivid, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition. At moments the diction edges toward purple, with stacked figurative choices that could be pared back for even greater impact, but clarity remains intact. The final sentence lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, with strong images (droplets drifting “like tears,” arches as “bridges of rose and gold”) and efficient exposition woven into scene. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge. A few phrases and structures recur (“strangers became family”) and the imagery verges on purple in places, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. The closure image—chalk taken up by the living under the violet sky—lands crisply and recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with images that often do double duty for setting and emotion (“wounded gold,” “the shape sound once made”). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; metaphors stay internally consistent and rarely feel mixed or overwrought. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the piece maintains momentum despite its reflective, lyric mode. A slight risk of saturation in the middle (several metaphysical descriptions in close succession) keeps it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is clean, with varied syntax, high information density, and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and most metaphors are coherent and concrete. Pacing is well-controlled; no paragraph feels disposable, and exposition is efficiently woven into action. There’s room for a bit more compression or edge in peak-pressure sentences, but there are no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and metaphors that are coherent with the story’s scientific and natural frame. Images like “abandoned architecture of change” or grief loosening “like foam dissolving” are apt and concrete. Reflection and description generally pull double duty, advancing both emotion and concept, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. There is a slight tendency toward reiterating the same conceptual cluster (connection, self-organization, symphony), but it reads as intentional motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, vivid, and information-dense without obvious scaffold or redundancy. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (moonlight as quantified lack, incisions as archaeological strata of pain). Transitions between beats are smooth, and the final sentence elegantly braids setting and theme without over-explaining. A touch of conceptual repetition (“absence,” “clean slate” philosophy) keeps this just shy of the rarefied 9+ band but does not materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied in length, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language (“crystallized time,” “emotional sediment,” “feast of failures”) is apt and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or redundancy loops. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line advances mood, world, or pressure. The density of imagery is high but remains controlled, so momentum and clarity are preserved through the climax and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: strong verbs, concrete images, and multi-tasking sentences that advance setting, character, and theme together. Metaphors like “borrowed starlight” and “construct bridges from silos” are clear and cohesive rather than mixed or overwrought. There are few if any redundant loops; the piece maintains momentum despite being reflective in places. A slight sentimental sheen near the ending keeps it from feeling razor-sharp, but craft control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, dense, and purposeful—most sentences do more than one job, blending worldbuilding with emotion and concept. Metaphors (canyon as skull, memories as double helices) are coherent and thematically aligned rather than piled on indiscriminately, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold. Rhythm is varied, and paragraphing supports momentum despite a reflective mode. A couple of repeated formulations (“chaotically precise,” “helix-minded”) flirt with overemphasis, but they don’t significantly drag clarity or pace.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do more than one job, interweaving worldbuilding with atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“limestone like the intestines of some ancient beast,” “stone tears floated past her face”) are vivid and controlled rather than over-stacked. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and syntax remains clear even with complex concepts like threshold effects and inversion. Occasionally the language edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t blur sense or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for world, character, and theme. Figurative language is consistent and grounded in the story’s physics (stress cracks as notation, vibrations as empathy) and rarely feels overwrought. There’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn; momentum is maintained even through reflective passages. A few thematic statements could be tightened, but they don’t significantly drag or muddle the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in one move) without feeling overloaded. Sensory specifics (“air tasted of iron and ozone,” “polished basalt stone…dent worn smooth”) are strong and efficiently placed. There are no notable loops, mixed metaphors, or register slips, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. While not formally dazzling, the line-level craft is solidly above-average and needs minimal editing for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; images like “the difference between breathing and being breathed by the world” are striking without becoming incoherent. Figurative language is frequent but thematically aligned (sound, silence, resonance) and doesn’t collapse into mixed-metaphor muddle. A slight density of abstractions near the end (“path to empathy,” “legacy,” “varieties of resilience”) nudges toward the conceptual, but not enough to drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, musical, and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“like distant thunder,” “wildflower hush of dawn”). Sensory descriptions are specific without devolving into purple density, and momentum is rarely stalled by exposition. A few lines drift toward abstract summary or familiar formulation, especially in the final paragraphs, but not enough to flatten the closure image. There are no major loops, scaffolding artifacts, or figurative muddles that obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is clear, concise, and mostly free of scaffolding or repetition; information density is high and almost every sentence does at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus motion, or image plus stakes). Rhythm varies reasonably, and figurative language is selective and largely apt, avoiding muddled metaphors. There are a few slightly expository patches (e.g., explaining the treaty/root modification in summarized form) that could be dramatized or compressed further for maximal sharpness. Overall, craftsmanship is solid and publication-ready, though not yet at the razor-honed, sentence-level brilliance of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, largely free of scaffolding, and balances description with forward motion. Sentences often do double duty (atmosphere + information) and avoid clutter; rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. There is some mild repetition of key phrases (“hazy precision,” “foresight”) and a slightly expository midsection around the explanation of wind tunnels, but it doesn’t seriously bog the piece. Figurative language is restrained and generally coherent, especially in the climactic “labyrinth breathing” and “containers hummed” images.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, generally tight, and often do double duty by advancing action and atmosphere together. Figurative language (“chains breaking in reverse,” “its walls humming frequencies only he could see”) is fresh and mostly controlled, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is some drift toward abstract phrasing (“certify wonder as essential,” “the capacity for awe, preserved in amber and ice”) that slightly flattens immediacy in places. Still, clarity is maintained throughout and momentum does not noticeably stall.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-by-line, the prose is precise, economical, and vivid; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuild, characterize, and advance pressure). Metaphors and images (snowpack, bridge-not-reflection sound, reeds touching three realities) are fresh and coherent, without stacking into purple muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. The closing sentence lands cleanly, rephrasing the core idea without redundancy heavy enough to dull the image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with information, and nearly every one advances character, concept, or atmosphere. Figurative language (e.g., “equations—not written but existing, the way grief exists in a clenched jaw”) is fresh and controlled rather than piled on. There are no visible loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors; the prose maintains clarity even while carrying complex ideas. The final cadence (“before there’s nothing left to feel about”) crisply recharges both the cosmic and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “time seemed to thicken around them like honey in cold air” are vivid yet controlled, and sentences generally do more than one job. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; exposition is compact and usually tethered to present cues. A few lines lean toward explanatory or abstract (“This was what the pendant truly did…”) but they don’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the prose reads polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening advisable for maximal subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythms are generally smooth, and most images do double duty in building mood and meaning. Phrases like “skeletal cathedral” and “captured smoke” are vivid without becoming incoherent or mixed metaphors, though the prose occasionally nears purple in piling figurative description. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; most lines move character, world, or theme forward. A slight tendency to restate realizations (“Mara’s assumptions about reality shattered”) keeps it just short of elite tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, rhythmic, and multi-functional, with images (threads, edges, light in amber) doing real thematic work. A few repetitions and slightly ornamental modifiers (“stoically sparkling” twice, “raveling silence” reiterated) edge toward self-conscious lyricism. Even so, clarity and momentum are not harmed, and the closure image is clean and potent. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every line earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) with minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops, and the rhythm varies to match the scene’s rising pressure. Figurative language is dense but generally purposeful and coherent (e.g., arches like “broken promises” that later “remember how to dream”), with no mixed metaphors that muddle sense. There are virtually no grammatical or clarity slips, and the final images land cleanly. At times the prose edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t stall momentum or obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphor is inventive (“a laugh that smelled like cardamom,” “a negative sound”) and mostly controlled, with few mixed or redundant images. Sentences vary in length and structure, and almost all lines do multiple jobs (world-building plus character plus mood). A couple of places verge on explanatory abstraction (“translating the untranslatable, finding paths through impossible spaces”) but they don’t stall momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely tight, rhythmic, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme, and the narrative moves forward without bogging down in loops. A few phrases lean toward purple or generalized (“light and longing,” “pure and absolute”) and slightly dilute edge, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure. Line-level control is strong enough for competitive venues, if not yet at the very rarefied top.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean rhythm, and dense lines that usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and mood at once). Imagery like the wick’s “galaxies within its transparent length” is evocative without collapsing into confusion, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. The technical explanation of the wick is integrated smoothly and remains legible. Some readers might find the language flirting with purple, but it’s controlled and purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and figurative language that is usually fresh and apt (“cups thin as whispers,” “steam rose like valley mist”). There are no notable loops, scaffolding sentences, or clotted metaphor stacks that impede clarity; almost every line advances character, world, or theme. The rhythm supports the contemplative mood without dragging, and the final sentence lands cleanly as an image, not an explanation. A few phrases flirt with prettiness-for-its-own-sake, but they don’t materially dull momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language (rings, prophecies, dreams in wood) is vivid but not over-stacked, and the metaphors cohere with the story’s conceptual spine. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the final paragraphs land cleanly without explanatory bloat. A touch of abstract summarizing near the end keeps it just shy of the very highest band but doesn’t meaningfully dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally concise yet image-rich, with minimal redundancy and clear sequencing. Figurative language (“like luminous moths,” “threads of gold and rose…tangled with the others in a great tapestry”) is mostly fresh and coherent with the world’s logic. There are minor tendencies toward conceptual repetition (reiterating what binding/release means) but not enough to drag momentum. The final paragraphs, in particular, balance clarity and lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density—most sentences carry character, atmosphere, or theme simultaneously. There are a few abstract or slightly lofty phrasings (“transmute it into understanding,” “accumulated longing and revelation”) but they don’t obscure meaning or momentum. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal, and action order remains clear throughout. With slightly more concrete embodiment of Eleanor’s emotional beats, the line-level could feel even more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmically varied, with high information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, world, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is present but not overstacked; images like “falling into earth that remembered everything” are clear and earned. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or grammatical slips, and transitions between description, thought, and dialogue are smooth. Line-level control strongly supports the story’s quiet, accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically tethered to light, sound, and cold; it rarely drifts into muddle or redundancy. There are a few slightly abstract or elevated phrases (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) that skim close to loftiness, but they remain anchored in concrete stakes. No major scaffolding, loops, or rhythm artifacts impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are lean yet evocative, with strong verb choices and purposeful imagery (e.g., “comforting cadence…stories by the fire, lullabies that smelled like copper and grain alcohol”). There’s good rhythmic variation and very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line carries character, world, or tension. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding purple excess or mixed metaphors, and the final image of the fob swinging as she climbs back toward the stars lands cleanly. Any minor density in description never drags momentum or muddies sense.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory, and multi-purpose, with little redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors like “something between zinc and starlight, if starlight had a flavor” are fresh and legible, and figurative density stays just on the right side of lush. A few phrases veer toward conceptual stacking (“invisible architecture,” “terrestrially cosmic”) that risk mild purple-ness but don’t obscure sense or momentum. The piece maintains clarity and propulsion despite its reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Metaphors are mostly coherent and apt, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy that stalls momentum. There are a few moments of purple or stacked abstraction (“Such waste. Such beautiful waste.”) and some thematically loaded phrasing, but they don’t obscure clarity or the closure image. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive markets, even if not utterly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with figurative language that is vivid but not excessive (“toxic sky pressed its rust-colored weight against the glass” is a standout). Almost every line either advances setting, character, or thematic pressure; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythm of paragraphs supports momentum across summary (“for weeks, she pieced it together”) into sharply rendered present beats. A touch more compression in the middle (“for weeks” and similar exposition) could sharpen momentum further, but the existing balance is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with metaphor used mostly in service of image rather than adornment. Occasional abstractions (“truth,” “wonder”) are repeated in similar formulations, and a few phrases verge on the poetic-generic, but they don’t seriously bog momentum. There are no evident loops, syntax glitches, or figurative muddles near the ending. The prose supports rather than upstages the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, purposeful repetition (“strangely organic,” “contained”) as motif rather than filler, and a good balance of clarity and lyricism. Most lines multitask—advancing plot while sharpening atmosphere or theme—and there’s little dead scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is generally clean and coherent, with only rare edges of on-the-nose phrasing that don’t materially dull momentum or the closure image. The final paragraphs in particular are tight and image-driven, with “fragmented but functional” and “navigating by an internal compass” landing clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme) without padding. Metaphors (“sandstorm calm,” “the way plants hear rain after drought”) are coherent and thematically aligned rather than piled on. There is some mild redundancy and conceptual telling in the final paragraph, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure the closure image. Grammar and mechanics are clean, with no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, characterization, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but mostly disciplined; images like “each bloom a syllable in her silent vocabulary” or locks recognizing her dance are vivid and legible. There are no noticeable loops, synonym churn, or structural artifacts, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A handful of metaphors (“liminal space between thought and action,” for instance) edge toward abstract, but they don’t materially obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, image-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence either advances the concept or deepens mood. Metaphors (constellations of water, memories crystallizing like salt) are coherent and mutually reinforcing, not piled indiscriminately. Information density is high without losing clarity, and paragraphing supports the gradual escalations in understanding. There is minor risk of tonal sameness in the consistently elevated lyricism, but it doesn’t noticeably impede momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with strong rhythm and few redundant scaffolds; most sentences advance atmosphere, worldbuilding, or action simultaneously. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and metaphors are clear even when lush. Minor purple inflections (“whispered secrets… like smoke through silk”) stay within genre-appropriate bounds and don’t obscure causality or image. The final paragraphs in particular land cleanly without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, well-balanced, and information-dense, with minimal redundancy. Metaphors are mostly apt and thematically aligned (buildings speaking, meteors as punctuation, books as skylines), giving the piece a cohesive texture. There is mild over-ornamentation in places—multiple layered metaphors in close proximity—but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure sense. Tightening a few descriptive phrases would sharpen impact without altering structure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. A few phrases repeat (“tragically radiant”), and there’s a slight tendency toward lushness, but it rarely slips into muddle or redundancy. Key beats—placing the shell to the flower, the garden beginning to pulse—are rendered with vivid, concrete language. Overall, the prose supports momentum and atmosphere without major artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense, with imagery (ink as blood-dark, stalactites’ “mineral patience”) doing multiple jobs at once. Repetition of certain motifs (aurora, stalactites, “pearl twilight”) builds cadence rather than feeling like scaffolding. There is some mild redundancy in restating the treason-as-deeper-loyalty idea and in a few near-synonymous formulations about permanence vs. change, but it doesn’t materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. Figurative language stays coherent and supports the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There are a few mildly purple or repetitive notes (“universe hums its secret song,” “secret song” reappears, “reed-blown melancholy”) but they don’t materially obscure sense. Information flows clearly, with no major scaffold loops or syntactic monotony. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious venues, though a stricter pruning of abstractions and repeated metaphors would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly deepen rather than blur (“making beauty from things that had traveled impossible distances to arrive here”). The recurring imagery of ice, flame, and starlight is handled with control rather than excess, and there are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences. A few lines edge toward purple, but they don’t muddy causality or the closure image. Overall, prose both carries atmosphere and advances story with minimal waste.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, image-rich, and multi-functional, often advancing character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent (e.g., fireflies as mapping invisible currents, whisk shadows as “moon paths”) without evident metaphor muddle or redundancy. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; almost every line earns its presence. A few adjectives (“scintillatingly somber,” for instance) flirt with ornamentation but do not materially drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and economical; almost every line advances character, world, or stakes without visible scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is restrained and clear, with “terrible mosaic” and “drew a circle around one precious thing” being effective and grounded. There are no evident loops or template cadences, and grammar and mechanics are polished. The line-level work is strong and unobtrusive rather than dazzling, which suits the piece but keeps it just below elite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: images are precise, metaphors mostly coherent, and there is good information density without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Lines frequently do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and theme (“whimsical as a drunk oracle, practical as a farmer’s almanac”). A few phrases flirt with purple or near-redundant lyricism, but they don’t materially obscure sense or slow momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are tight, sensuous, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but not cluttered; metaphors are coherent and grounded in the story’s material (sound, sand, light) rather than showy ornament. Momentum never stalls—even descriptive lines do double duty for character or theme—and grammar and sequencing are clean. The final sentence elegantly braids prior motifs without feeling overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). Sensory and figurative language are vivid (“a chorus of crystalline voices that made her teeth ache and her heart swell simultaneously”) without tipping into incoherence. There is some tendency toward high-flown description and stacked abstraction (“sonic absolution,” “sacred artifact that existed as much in sound as in matter”), but it remains legible and thematically aligned. No obvious loops or scaffolding slow momentum, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and images that usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion). Metaphors like “water beneath ice” and “revolution…could be a glacier” are vivid and coherent rather than purple. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and momentum is maintained despite reflective passages. A few lines tilt toward overt statement, but they don’t materially blur the closure image or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and carries strong images like the lantern’s flame, clawed panel, and reverberating drips that do multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, evidence). Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding lines. Some phrases verge on purple or conceptual (“entangled memories,” “resonance of persistence”) without always shaping concrete action, and certain formulations repeat (“through empirical observation”) with a slightly mechanical feel. Overall, though, clarity and momentum are maintained to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and efficiently carry both atmosphere and information without visible scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are mostly apt and controlled, and there’s no figurative muddle or syntactic monotony. A few phrases veer toward the familiar or slightly purple, but they don’t obstruct sense or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose reads polished and publication-ready at the sentence level, if not formally innovative.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, specific images (“pulleys that connected nothing to everything,” “prophecies written in refracted light and ancient intention”). Information density is good: exposition about the arrow tip and desire algorithms also advances worldbuilding and theme. There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (“yearning algorithm,” “desire”) but not to the point of loop or drag. Overall, line-level craft is solidly publication-ready with no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with good rhythm and minimal redundancy; sentences often carry both conceptual and emotional weight (“preserved null-state, a digital grave that somehow maintained the shape of what it once held”). The recurring number motif and repeated structures (“Then came others”) are pattern-driven rather than accidental loops. There is mild abstraction and a tendency to summarize complex investigative work rather than dramatize key steps, which lowers momentum somewhat. No serious artifacts or figurative muddle touch the closure, but the prose doesn’t quite reach that crystalline, indispensably tight level.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, fluid, and image-rich, with strong sentence rhythm and high information density; nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or theme. Metaphors (shadows, fragments, mirrors, ice) are coherent and braided rather than piled, avoiding purple muddle. There are very few redundancies or scaffolding sentences, and the final cadence (“map only empathy could read”) resonates back through prior motifs. Slight overtness in a couple of thematic statements is the main constraint preventing an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and theme), and avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Metaphors (“relationship with reality had loosened, like a knot”) are apt and not over-stacked, and there are no noticeable loops or template cadences. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and the final sentences land with distilled precision rather than purple flourish. This easily clears professional standards, falling short of the absolute top band only because it plays within a familiar lyric register rather than taking bolder rhythmic risks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with good sentence variety, strong verbs, and layered images that usually pull double duty for setting and theme. Phrases like “surrounded by the amber glow that made everything feel suspended in honey” are vivid without tipping too far into purple. There are a few mild overextensions (the cabernet/oak metaphor labeled as “tension waiting to become complexity,” the abstract terminology) but they don’t materially obscure sense or momentum. Information density is high and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong information density—most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Metaphoric language (“dunes sang their lowest frequencies,” “spaces carved from chaos”) is vivid and generally precise, without obvious mixed metaphors or purple excess. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite the calm tone. A touch more syntactic spareness at peak beats might sharpen impact, but current density is still controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, cleanly punctuated, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty (image + emotion or theme). Figurative language (constellations, skeleton of the factory, vines as archiving) is mostly controlled and coherent without mixed metaphors or purple overload. There are a few slightly redundant or abstract sentences, and the final paragraph edges toward sentimentality, but nothing seriously drags momentum or muddies the closure image. Overall, the prose would be publishable with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often elegant, with strong images like voices “meeting in the crystal’s memory like roots intertwining underground.” Information density is high; description typically does double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some repetition of conceptual points (language as not-fixed, the Council’s hubris), and a few abstract formulations could be tightened. Still, rhythm, clarity, and figurative control remain solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with high information density—many sentences simultaneously build atmosphere, character, and theme. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically linked to media, decay, and erasure, giving the piece a unified soundscape without feeling like purple prose. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or mechanical cadences; rhythm varies and supports the contemplative yet forward-moving tone. A few lines stack conceptual phrasing (“the audio signature of becoming”) where a slightly more concrete image might increase immediacy, but clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, vivid, and largely free of redundancy, with metaphors that are specific and controlled (“lenses and shutters obeyed similar laws… both desperate to capture what constantly slipped away”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and most lines do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and theme) without bogging momentum. There is a mild density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and does not tip into purple or obscure clarity, including at the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are varied, clear, and often do double duty in advancing mood and character. There is some reliance on familiar constructions (“weight of confirmation,” “split them apart like continents,” “indifferent and eternal”) and explicit abstractions (“ordinary grace”), which slightly dull the edge. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple or confusing. Momentum holds steadily; summary sections are compact and functional rather than flabby.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. The figurative language is vivid but controlled, with only a few high-flown phrases and no mixed metaphors or purple drifts that obscure sense. Information density is high yet readable, and transitions between present action and explanatory context are smooth. The only limit to an even higher score is that some conceptual explanation could perhaps be made more kinetic, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry multiple functions (advancing plot, building atmosphere, revealing character) without bloat. Metaphors tend to be apt and oriented to the story’s images (“skepticism cracking open like an egg,” “garden exhaled twilight”), with no obvious mixed or overwrought figures. There’s minimal repetition or scaffolding; exposition is folded into action and dialogue with decent economy. A few phrases (“nostalgic innovation,” “constellations…map of return”) are a touch abstract compared to the otherwise concrete texture but don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: most sentences do at least double duty for image, mood, and character. Recurring phrases (sea glass, mist, light, “pearl of stillness”) feel like deliberate motif rather than scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is coherent and apt; there’s no noticeable metaphor churn or purple excess that obscures sense. Momentum is appropriately gentle yet steady, with no paragraphs that could be cut without meaningful loss.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and almost always doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (amber as time’s way of holding pain, hatred as an algorithm) is vivid and coherent without tipping into purple prose or mixed metaphors. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between description, interiority, and action are smooth. A few phrases flirt with abstraction, but they’re grounded quickly by concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and economical, with strong sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, psychology, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“where three rivers collided,” “writing inside the whisper of closing pages”) is rich but controlled and not so stacked as to blur clarity. Momentum holds despite reflection, because nearly every paragraph sharpens the central tension or reconfigures prior images. Line-level craft is publication-ready; any minor tendency toward overt thematic phrasing does not materially dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that usually do more than one job (atmosphere, theme, and action at once). Figurative language—“gold as the stories,” “carry songs directly into the roots of the world”—is apt and not overstacked to the point of purple density. There is little obvious scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained even in reflective lines. A few abstract summaries of the world’s malaise are less vivid than the scene work but do not materially drag the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythmic control and largely efficient, multi-tasking sentences that advance both image and emotional state. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful (e.g., branches as “petrified fingers,” starlight “remembering” its origin); it stops short of purple. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that drag momentum or obscure cause and effect. A few lines verge on lushness, but they do not blunt the clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, specific images, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is selective and clear (“gears splayed like the wings of a mechanical butterfly”), and the rhythm supports the meditative yet investigative mode. Information density is high without becoming opaque, and paragraphs each earn their keep. There is no notable looping, purple excess, or artifacting that muddies the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: images are fresh, metaphors coherent and extended with intention (“bronze met bone,” calcified coral, whale ribs), and sentences carry multiple functions without bloat. There’s little to no paraphrase looping or filler; nearly every line adds texture or advances the accumulative pressure. The prose is lush but avoids purple excess; figurative density remains readable and focused, especially around the key realizations. A touch more variation between lush and pared-back moments at peak pressure could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and dense with meaning; images like “the blank…waited like an unanswered question” and “a gallery of gestures, a museum of moments” are fresh and precise. Figurative language is present but controlled, rarely tipping into excess, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a slight tendency toward thematic phrasing (“harvesting lessons from loss,” “what only grief could teach”) that reads a bit essayistic but doesn’t seriously blunt momentum. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts; the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, with strong verbs and generally disciplined imagery (“Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water”) pulling multiple weights. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph introduces new pressure or nuance. The prose flirts with lushness, but most metaphors are coherent and thematically linked (erosion, motion, mechanisms), so density rarely impedes clarity or momentum. Minor risk of over-metaphorization in a couple of lines keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and efficient: most sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus character, theme plus image) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors like “maze of intentions” and “ghost-blueprints” feel apt rather than overwrought. Line-level clarity is high throughout, especially in the technical descriptions of redirected water and energy. A touch of abstraction and thematic restatement near the end keeps it just below the rarefied 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and generally carry multiple functions (advancing scene, character, and mood at once). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with a few recurring motifs (silence/hush, crystals, rain) rather than scattershot metaphor. There is modest repetition (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush”) and occasional near-purple phrasing, but it doesn’t impede clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, if a touch safe in its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with metaphor used judiciously rather than in purple excess. Phrases like “serene upheaval of dawn” and “waters thick with amber reflection and diesel shimmer” are vivid yet controlled. There is some mild repetition of conceptual language (“architecture of lies,” “clarity”) and occasional explanatory sentences that could be sharpened, but they do not seriously drag momentum. No notable artifacts, loops, or syntactic monotony interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are thematically coherent (memory, weaving, transformation) rather than ornamental. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images like “lightning-struck sand, frozen into twisted glass tubes, each one unique as a fingerprint” doing multiple jobs at once. There’s very little scaffold or repetition, and the prose moves efficiently despite its lyricism. A few lines verge on the lush side, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and the metaphors are generally apt and fresh. There is a consistent density of figurative language, but it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and syntax stays lucid throughout. A few phrases border on purple or over-ornate, especially near thematic statements, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. The final images (garden at night, thread as compass, obituary as map) land cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion) with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language (“manufactured shadows,” “the mechanical world had grown a heartbeat”) is vivid and mostly economical, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum is well-maintained despite a reflective, process-heavy middle, and paragraphing supports natural breaths and emphasis. A few constructions cluster adjectives or concepts in ways that border on lushness, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and images that pull multiple duties (e.g., black sand as both setting and metaphor). The prose maintains momentum despite its reflective bent, with few extraneous scaffolding sentences. The main issue is a tendency toward purple or redundant abstract phrasing in key beats (“fierce and unyielding compassion,” “redemption wasn’t about erasing the past”), which slightly dulls the sharpness of otherwise excellent imagery. Trimming or concretizing some of those summary lines would tighten the effect considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and almost every line pulling double duty for atmosphere and world-building. Metaphors are mostly clean and apt; “existed slightly outside normal time, stuck between moments like an insect in amber” is a standout. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and exposition is folded into action smoothly. A few phrases (“realistic imagination,” “sidereal patience”) ride the edge of conceptual explanation, but they’re redeemed by how directly they plug into plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion—and the rhythmic variation keeps the piece from feeling monotonous. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or muddled metaphors. A few lines lean toward ornate (“across the quiet sigh of falling petals”), but they remain legible and purposeful rather than purple for its own sake. Line-level craft is a clear asset and does not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and mostly economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language (e.g., Thomas’s form as “heat shimmer,” grief as “weather patterns”) is apt and not overstacked. A few phrases lean toward abstraction or repetition of stated ideas about grief, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for a competitive venue, if not yet at a truly razor-edged, cut-every-extra-word standard.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are both coherent and thematically apt (bioluminescence, schools of fish, the sea’s creep). Exposition is lean and purposeful; backstory folds smoothly into present action without stalls. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases, and rhythm largely supports the meditative pacing. A few stacked modifiers flirt with purple, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic; most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and information, and there’s little visible scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and purposeful, and syntax varies enough to keep the pace from bogging. A few images stack toward the purple (e.g., “star-lanced darkness,” “velveteen gloom”) and could be pared for maximal impact. Overall, momentum and clarity are well maintained, with only minor risk of over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and economical: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) without obvious padding, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Imagery—“obsidian spire rose… like a blackened tooth,” “the moment before the pen meets the blank page”—is vivid yet mostly restrained, with minimal purple excess. There are no major artifacts, loops, or syntactic confusions; line-level clarity is high throughout. A touch more compression in some explanatory phrases about modeling and percentages could sharpen momentum further, but the current draft is already publication-grade at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet controlled, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing action while reinforcing motif and atmosphere. Metaphors (“dust had become secretly luminous,” “thistled calm”) are fresh and coherent, avoiding muddle or mixed vehicles. There is minimal scaffold or repetition; rhythm on the page feels intentional and read-aloud-ready. If anything, the figurative density is near the upper limit for this length and pressure, which may slightly soften the patrol beat’s immediacy, but it does not meaningfully obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and economical, with images (“voice like wind through hollow reeds,” “recording motion in stillness, presence in absence”) doing multiple jobs at once. Sentence rhythm varies to match pressure; descriptive density never quite tips into purple despite the lyric register. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and causality remains clear even as the language leans metaphorical. A few abstract formulations (“controlled disappearance,” “beautiful mirage”) are more telling than showing, but they don’t materially blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level prose is clean, precise, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery such as fish nesting in judges’ chambers and coral on subway tiles is vivid without tipping into purple, and sentences vary rhythmically. Expository patches are efficient and purposeful, not meandering, and no figurative muddle or cadence artifact undercuts the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length, generally high in information density, and avoid obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent (“wore autumn like a shawl,” “voice like clear water”) but mostly apt and not so stacked as to obscure sense. A few phrases tip toward the poetic-generic (“something ancient and essential”) yet they don’t significantly blunt the closure image. Overall, the prose has a smooth read-aloud quality that would require only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished, clear, and efficient, with images like “hope reclaiming architecture” and “metallic determination mixed with bitter grief” doing double duty for mood and backstory. Sentences vary in length and structure, maintaining momentum despite the reflective mode. There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors; figurative language is dense but generally controlled. The only limitation is that some thematic lines tell what the images already show, slightly softening the sharpness of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and controlled, with strong images (“amber sky like a skeletal finger”) that are vivid without frequently collapsing into purple. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry more than one piece of information—world-building, mood, and character insight often travel together. There are a few slightly thematic-heavy lines and metaphor stacking around honey/nectar imagery, but they form a coherent pattern rather than a muddle. Momentum is maintained; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and technical terms are handled cleanly and sparingly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly precise and evocative, and the story maintains momentum without getting bogged down in exposition. There is a slight tendency toward over-articulated abstraction in key thematic sentences, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening of overt statements.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and functional; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotional shading, for instance). Metaphors are controlled and coherent with the underwater/stone milieu, and rhythm varies enough to create a smooth read. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffold; exposition is compressed efficiently into a few paragraphs without derailing momentum. The main limitation is mild repetition of key abstract terms (“nuance,” “truth”) where a fresh image might carry more charge.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: few wasted sentences, clear syntax, and information-dense paragraphs that carry both concept and emotion. Recurring phrases and structures (“she rolled the dice again,” “perfect conservation. Perfect prison.”) read as purposeful pattern rather than scaffolding. There’s mild conceptual repetition about missed opportunities and perpetual motion that could be trimmed to sharpen momentum. No major artifacts or figurative muddles appear, but an occasional reliance on summary phrasing (“A grim fate, certainly”) slightly flattens otherwise sharp prose.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and almost every line pulls weight for both atmosphere and character. Images like “saffron quiet of three a.m.” and moonbeams “pooling” on the table are vivid without becoming incoherent. There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors around light and color (“amber uncertainty,” “almost liquid”), which edges on purple but doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony appear, and the final paragraphs land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with metaphors that are largely precise and character-inflected (“rosewater dread,” “time pooled like standing water”). There’s minimal redundancy, and exposition is efficiently braided into action and voice rather than dumped. Rhythm and paragraphing support a measured, elegiac pace without becoming slack. A tiny handful of phrases flirt with being a bit ornamental, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines advance both atmosphere and concept. Metaphors are generally precise and thematically aligned (e.g., “string wound through dimensions,” “pressed into the bronze like fossils”), with no major muddles or mixed images. A few conceptual phrases repeat ideas (“radiance made solid, time made tangible”) but they read as intensifications rather than scaffolding. The final image is clear and uncluttered, and there are no noticeable loops or technical errors that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and efficient: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or image plus theme). Metaphors are mostly apt and non-redundant, with only occasional risk of overload, and there are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences that stall momentum. Rhythm varies sensibly across beats, and the final line lands cleanly without syntactic clutter. A slightly high saturation of “grotesque yet beautiful” descriptors approaches purple in places, but doesn’t yet compromise clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and there’s a satisfying rhythmic variety. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (fractals, music, architecture), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess that would muddy sense. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or mechanical cadences, and action remains clear even in the higher-intensity beats. A slight density of ornamentation in descriptive stretches keeps this just below the very topmost band, but it never impairs clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, concrete nouns and specific verbs dominate, and each line tends to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) without redundancy. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and the central metaphors (spirals, livestock/shepherds, sunwashed dread) are coherent and sustained. I see no significant scaffold or paraphrase loops, and no mixed metaphors in peak beats that would blur sense. The only modest limitation is that a few explanatory clauses about the pattern language edge toward telling, but they remain tight and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clear, largely concise, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (ivy “strangled” facade, history’s “whispers” becoming “shouts”). Sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing plot while carrying atmosphere or theme—and there are few, if any, genuine artifacts or muddled metaphors. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “truth,” “noble lies,” and “recapture” that edges toward didactic emphasis, slightly dulling momentum. Still, line-level craft is solid and well above average for immediate readability and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences do multiple jobs (characterization, atmosphere, and theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually controlled and coherent, with only occasional bordering on purple (“something between ruin and cathedral”) without undermining clarity. Syntax is varied, and the line “The atmosphere held a hushed blaze, silent yet burning with memory” exemplifies the story’s ability to compress mood and idea efficiently. There are no noticeable loops, tense errors, or mechanical distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is clean and efficient: sentences are mostly well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and information-dense, with few redundancies. Imagery aligns with the setting (dark, pressure, light through deep water) and does not generally slip into mixed metaphors or purple excess. A few phrases (“reclaimed stillness,” some abstract labeling) verge on being slightly writerly, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose supports scene and mood without calling too much attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in rhythm, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with images like “luminous torment” and “looked like frozen music” sharpening rather than blurring sense. The prose avoids notable scaffolding, repetition loops, or mixed metaphors, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, charged cadence. A very light touch more sparing of overt metaphor in one or two places could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or physics plus theme). Metaphors are apt and controlled—the futures as “oil on water,” crystals like “captured stars”—without devolving into purple prose or mixed imagery. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum rarely stalls despite the conceptual load. The prose could perhaps sharpen a few abstract phrases into even more concrete sensory or tactical beats, but it’s already solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and pull double duty for atmosphere and information, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is selective and generally apt; “brilliant dimness” and “painted everything in shades of gold and ash” are memorable without tipping into purple. There are no noticeable syntactic loops, tense slips, or metaphor muddles, and each paragraph advances situation or emotional charge. A handful of lines lean on familiar constructions (“felt tears surprising her eyes”), but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, images are clear, and most lines do double duty in advancing plot and mood. Figurative language is present but controlled, and key metaphors (time, driftwood, the watch hand) remain coherent. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or over-explained moments that drag momentum. The prose is clean enough for high-level publication, even if it doesn’t quite break into stylistic audacity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, economical, and do multiple jobs (setting, character, and theme) without padding. Figurative language—storms stripping away ownership, lights as “uncertain stars”—is apt and not overstacked. There is minimal redundancy and no noticeable scaffolding or template cadence, so momentum is preserved throughout. The opening and closing images are especially sharp and well-calibrated to the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for setting and emotion. Metaphors (regret as fog, gravitational pull, broken compass refracting light) are coherent and thematically aligned, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. A few lines verge on purple or explanatory (“clarifying,” “illusions falling away”) rather than letting the images fully carry the load, but these are minor. Momentum flows smoothly from reflection to decision to action without bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and economical for the most part, with many sentences doing double duty (character + atmosphere or theme). Image systems (void/labyrinth/light) are coherent rather than muddled, and there’s little in the way of scaffold or repetition artifacts. A few phrases verge on purple or self-conscious (“understanding settling like sediment,” the re-use of “delicately robust”), but they don’t obscure sense or stall momentum. Line-level craft is clearly above typical submission quality, if not yet at flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is fluid and evocative, with strong metaphors like “pollen that glittered like crushed stars” and “his voice the sound of cinnamon dissolving on the tongue” that both clarify and enchant. A few lines lean into explanatory abstraction, especially in the late thematic sentences, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent, avoiding muddle or repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., “The beauty was choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest, made breathing an act of deliberation.”). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and not excessively stacked. There are no evident loops or scaffolding lines; almost every sentence earns its place. Occasional near-purple moments and generalities keep this from feeling utterly airtight at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are fresh, specific, and rarely redundant, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“scales on a fish,” “salt crystals catching light like tiny galaxies”) are coherent and not overstacked, and there is no scaffolding or synonym churn. The prose maintains momentum even in reflective moments, and there are no loops that restate the same idea in adjacent lines. Minor lyric density at times presses toward lushness but does not blur clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, concrete, and dense with information, and most images work cleanly ("libraries and hospitals instead of scandal and ruin," "sugar in rain"). There is little to no scaffold or obvious repetition, and the prose carries momentum even in reflective passages. A few lines tilt toward declarative abstraction, but they don't materially blur the closure image. The final paragraphs land with a clear, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and economical, with a good balance between description, interiority, and forward motion; most sentences carry multiple functions cleanly. Metaphor use (light, sparks, angles) is controlled and coherent, avoiding purple excess. There is some mild thematic repetition in the closing lines about revolution and light that could be sharpened, but no real scaffolding, loops, or artifacts that impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with few redundancies, and imagery (“where the stone held memory of friction”) is striking without tipping into incoherence. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum in a mostly contemplative scene. Figurative language is fairly dense but thematically coherent (patterns, light, tides), so it reads as intentional texture rather than ornament. A slight tendency toward high-concept phrasing in peak beats could be trimmed for even more force, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the storm became something else entirely—a performance of light and fury that transformed the dome's copper surface into a stage for shadows”). Figurative language is generally precise and thematically aligned, and the paragraphs earn their space. There is a slight tendency toward repeated key phrases and near-purple elevation (“cartography of scars,” “rareified,” “truth…pass through any barrier”) that risks over-signaling theme, but it doesn’t meaningfully obscure clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening desirable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and vivid yet controlled metaphors (“steel singing against steel,” “sunlight… painted everything in amber possibility”). Prose balances atmosphere with momentum, and there is little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or template cadence. The lyricism edges toward lush in places but remains coherent and purposeful, with no figurative muddle in peak beats. Overall, the lines read as publication-ready with only minor tightening imaginable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, and motion) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors (gardens through concrete, blooming resistance, rust as fertile fracture) are coherent and sustained rather than piled indiscriminately. There are a few slightly abstract or explanatory patches, but they do not meaningfully drag momentum or blur sense. The prose is controlled and publishable as-is, though a ruthless edit could trim a couple of expository lines to make the lyricism even tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; images like “trees grew sideways from floating islands of earth that rose and fell like breathing” or “branches wept silver leaves” are vivid without clogging momentum. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and most lines do at least two jobs (setting plus emotion, or image plus theme). There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or therapy-speak, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered. A few abstractions (“grinding disappointment,” “perpetually overlooked”) are serviceable rather than arresting, which is the only thing keeping this shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language (“gray mist,” “flowers opening to face the light before the storm”) is apt and not overstacked; there’s little in the way of scaffold or synonym loops. Prose occasionally leans on familiar constructions (“time was running short,” “no other choice”), but these don’t materially dull the closure. Overall, the writing would require only light polishing for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length, most carry multiple functions, and images are usually clear and apt. Some metaphors (“waves that had learned patience over centuries,” “cerulean regret”) verge on purple, especially when stacked in close proximity, but they remain coherent. A few explanatory lines and thematic assertions could be cut or sharpened to increase momentum and trust the reader more. There are no major clarity issues or loops that obscure action or emotion.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no wasted scaffolding. Images like the "geological record of disaster compressed into centimeters" are excellent. The writing is polished and precise, effectively mirroring the protagonist's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high and imagery is evocative. However, the verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "steadily adaptive" (once for "will," once for "hands") reads as a noticeable echo/artifact that momentarily disrupts the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from some sentimental phrasing ("defiant purples," "symphonies from the silent expressions"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("watching," "could see," "could no longer hear") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("tired ghost," "desperate morse") without dragging. The imagery of light and geometry carries the narrative argument efficiently, free of scaffold or repetitive artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose relies on clichés ("whispered secrets," "heart hammered") and abstract pairings ("clay and hope"). While mechanically clean, the line-level craft lacks freshness and density.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density in the opening. However, some metaphors ("tasted like smoke," "sky bleeding pink and gold") feel derivative, and the "panic breathing" diagnosis relies on telling rather than showing the physiological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is evocative and density is high, with strong imagery ("watercolor on wet paper," "standing in a doorway between two mirrors"). The line-level craft supports the surreal tone without collapsing into incoherence or excessive abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but relies on some well-worn similes ("dancer with ribbons") and abstract descriptors ("weight of purpose"). The line-level craft is functional but lacks the freshness required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("webbed with calcium deposits," "kelp in current"), establishing a strong rhythm that supports the magical realism. A few descriptors lean toward the repetitive ("impossible garden," "impossible light"), but the overall line-level control is high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but leans toward purple phrasing ("understanding blooming like sudden spring," "voice like rustling petals"). While the rhythm is good, the reliance on filter verbs and abstract descriptors softens the impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically competent, though it occasionally leans into "workshop poetry" with phrases like "quiet violence" and "surrendering to warmth." Sensory imagery is effective, but the reliance on abstract descriptors in place of concrete action slightly dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent and moves well, though marred by occasional overwriting ("indifferent stars," "terrible comprehension"). The density of adjectives slightly slows the pacing, but clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("veins in precious stone"). However, the pacing drags slightly due to a reliance on abstract nouns and reflective summary over concrete action. The "ambered hush" phrase repeats enough to verge on becoming a text artifact without deepening its meaning through variation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lyrical and polished, fitting the tone well. However, the required word "amalgamate" appears three times in close proximity (paragraphs 7, 9, 10), creating a noticeable repetitive artifact that momentarily disrupts the flow. Phrasing like "silence that wasn't quite silent" leans slightly toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mechanically clean, but marred by clichés ("face crumpled," "hand trembled") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader. The prose leans towards the "purple" side ("sacred silence") without offering the density or freshness required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean, though occasional adverbs and abstract phrasing ("wisely pragmatic efficiency," "impossible profusion") dilute the imagery. The rhythm is controlled, but the reliance on dialogue for exposition slows the mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished in description but marred by the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("hush of beating wings at rest," "mechanically warm," "subdued awakening") within a short word count. These repetitions read as inserted prompt constraints rather than intentional motifs, creating a "check-the-box" texture that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but cluttered with clichés ("breath caught," "inspiration surge," "dancing shadows"). Word choice is occasionally repetitive ("murky" appears twice in key spots), and the rhythm lacks variation during the discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with high density. A few metaphors lean toward the conventional ("stone" in the throat, grief as "ballast"), and the final paragraph creates a slight drag by explaining the emotional resonance rather than ending on the image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished but leans heavily on simile ("thick as wool," "like honey," "like a wire," "like sediment"), bordering on purple. The repetition of the phrase "religiously skeptical" (paragraphs 1 and 8) is a visible artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally polished with some strong imagery, but it relies on clichés ("trembling shadows," "speaks volumes") and abstract assertions that stall momentum. The phrase "regenerative silence speaks volumes" specifically weakens the line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose depends heavily on clichés ("golden as wheat," "chasm," "world held its breath") and abstract emotive labels ("essential magic," "particular satisfaction"). These artifacts flatten the texture of the writing, replacing specific observation with generic literary shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric ("bronze quiet," "texture like braille"), showing strong image control. It occasionally leans into overwriting or "tell" ("sensitively perceptive," "ancient covenant") that blunts the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery in the descriptions of the spycraft. However, a few similes feel worn ("irony settled... like an old coat," "regular as a heartbeat"), and the density of the final paragraph leans toward abstract summary rather than concrete, embodied observation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "void itself became architecture" anchoring the imagery. The rhythm mimics the layering of the loop pedal effectively, though some dialogue tags carry slightly heavy interpretive weight.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and strong imagery ("time moved like honey," "mirrored horizon"). A few metaphors veer into abstraction ("hums in the key of forgotten summers," "frequency of truth"), which slightly dulls the precision of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("periodically eternal"), though it relies on some cliché similes ("crystallized like ice") and abstract summaries. The line-level craft is competent but density is occasionally diluted by the repetition of thematic keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good attention to sensory density. The required phrases are integrated relatively smoothly, though "audibly muted" reads slightly clunky. Line-level craft is the story's strongest asset.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric. The score is held back by tell-heavy phrasing in pivotal moments ("intuited the fuller picture") and the awkward adjectival stuffing of "credibly curious nature," which feels like a prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density ("clinical compassion," "wistful quiet"). The imagery of light and shadow is woven through the narrative without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("ghost of that desperate choice," "visual echoes"). Line-level craft is polished, though there is a slight tendency toward filter verbs ("Marcus saw," "Marcus found") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally fluid and evocative, though occasionally reliant on familiar imagery ("jewel in a crown," "turning rust to gold"). The descriptions of sound and the greenhouse interior show high craft, maintaining momentum through the description.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    Imagery is often striking ("jagged purple lightning," "amber current"), showing high density and propulsion. However, explanatory bridging sentences ("Maren understood... in her professionally thorough way") occasionally flatten the momentum by summarizing what has already been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and fluid with good density ("lights illuminating spines while leaving the stars brilliant"). However, it relies on "telling" internal states ("shame warming her cheeks," "whimsical attention") rather than dramatizing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective density ("crystalline tears," "iridescent soil," "luminescent ache") that slows momentum. Line-level rhythm is generally smooth, though the reliance on abstract metaphorical phrasing distances the reader from immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("rules dissolved like morning fog," "thick as honey, thin as wire"). The sentence-level craft supports the pacing, accelerating appropriately during the unlocking sequence. There are no distracting artifacts or loops; the description serves the story's forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is rhythmic and dense with imagery, though the reliance on filter verbs ("he noticed," "he realized") occasionally distances the reader from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and readable but leans on some familiar phrasings ("car horns bleated," "flickering uncertainty"). The sentence rhythm is smooth, but the reliance on abstract nouns in key moments ("crystallized her purpose") flattens the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on explanatory telling ("meaning yesterday," "something had shifted") to advance the plot. The reliance on summary for the transformation creates a distancing effect that mutes the emotional impact of the wire-cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "rain trails... like a promise." There are minor instances of stock metaphor ("Sleep was a country"), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric tone well without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has momentum, but the required phrase "steadily unpredictable" reads as a forced oxymoron that creates a logical stumble in the description. Repetitive imagery ("bright darkness") and filter verbs flatten the impact of the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is rhythmically sound and capable of striking imagery, particularly regarding the mist and the archive. However, it leans heavily on "writerly" abstractions and personification ("cliffs still wept," "courage to move forward") that can feel ornamental. The efficiency is high, but the density comes from exposition rather than scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose mechanics are clean and rhythm is generally good. There is a tendency toward "adjective-noun" pairings and abstract metaphor ("fortress of unspoken truths") that occasionally obscures the literal action, but the line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery (&quot;kindness hollowed her bones&quot;). There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs (&quot;Elena watched,&quot; &quot;She saw&quot;) during the visionary sequence which distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, atmospheric, and propulsive. The description "colors that had no names" is a minor genre cliché that slightly softens the otherwise specific and vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and effective imagery ("wind through mountain passes"). A few descriptors feel slightly standard ("indifferent, enormous"), but the line-level craft effectively supports the story's melancholic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("delicate gold-ink notations," "pink snow"), creating a strong textural experience. A few phrases lean toward overwriting or cliché ("impossible geometries," "exhaled its morning perfume"), and the reliance on abstract labels ("emotional texture," "contradictory truths") slightly dulls the immediacy of the showing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but heavy on expositional scaffolds ("The bureaucratic error... had also freed her") that explain meaning rather than showing it through interaction. While readable, the reliance on generalizing summaries ("This was when they talked most freely") dilutes the impact of the specific dialogue fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, though it occasionally leans into overwrought similes ("crystallized like frost on glass"). The climax relies heavily on summary ("desperate confessions of strangers") rather than concrete sensory immediacy. Rhythm and flow are competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("circling like sharks") and summary-heavy constructions that tell rather than show ("making gentrification sound like evolution"). The rhythm is steady but lacks the propulsive density required for immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose has momentum, but the "sound in vacuum" error ("whirred") is a major line-level flaw for this genre. Additionally, heavy-handed similes ("like history itself crumbling") reduce the impact of the otherwise solid descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with explaining adjectives ("heartfelt," "practiced," "delicate"). Some metaphors ("breathing thing," "sound like contentment") border on cliché, but the technical descriptions of the water diagnosis are distinct and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear, but the verbatim repetition of the phrase "worrying tranquility" in the narrative voice disrupts immersion and reads as a prompt insertion. Phrasing like "understanding crystallized like ice" feels somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively utilizing the auditory motif, though it relies on some filter verbs ("could hear") and stock phrasing ("drinking in the morning light") that soften the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythmic control during the release sequence. Occasional purple phrasing ("coruscated in spirals," "impossible technology") and filter verbs clutter the otherwise clean descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and polished with strong rhythm ("clung to its reef like a barnacle to dying stone"). There is a slight over-reliance on the keyword "hush" and "copper," which borders on repetitive, but the imagery generally lands with precision. The line-level craft supports the somber, reflective mood without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from adjective-noun stacking and mixed metaphors ("texture of... arsenic" conflates tactile and chemical properties). The reliance on "impossible" descriptors ("impossible colors," "impossible dawn") weakens the specificity of the imagery. There is a tendency toward ornamental phrasing that slows momentum without adding information density.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and elegant, though occasionally relies on abstract nouns ("transcendence," "reverence") and standard somatic phrases ("humming in her chest"). The comparison to "neural pathways" feels slightly anachronistic for the established mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric ("bone-rich earth"), but suffers from a reliance on filter verbs and internal telling ("Mira felt differently," "she realized with a quickening pulse"). The final paragraph's didactic summary of the theme flattens the prose rhythm into a lesson rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery in the opening, but the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "carefully inventive" creates a noticeable artifact. Additionally, moments of "telling" (explaining the futuristic nostalgia) and slightly clunky metaphors ("messages in bottles") dampen the line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and polished with excellent rhythm. The repetition of "adjacent possibilities" and "synchronize" serves as effective pattern-teaching rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally strong and lyrical, but a cluster of filter verbs ("Isla watched," "Isla saw," "Isla felt") in the climax weakens the immersion. Additionally, phrases like "words became weapons" veer into cliché, and the opening simile ("twisted like frozen thoughts") reads as slightly strained.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric but occasionally overwrought ("gauzy and distant," "night-flowering jasmine"). The density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene. Line-level mechanics are clean, though the rhythm is somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    There are moments of high-quality imagery ("skeletal apple trees," "developing in reverse"), but these compete with worn phrases like "fog... like spilled milk" and "colors sang." The prose generally sustains momentum, but the tendency toward slightly twee descriptors ("edible stars") softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("weight like an anchor—or like wings"). A brief expository block explaining Marta's "methodically playful" nature interrupts the momentum slightly, telling what could have been shown purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, with strong imagery ("imprisoned thoughts seeking freedom"). Occasional lapses into melodrama ("Converging chaos... is how revolutions begin") slightly mar the otherwise high-quality line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation. A few phrases ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesize pain") border on purple but fit the established poetic voice. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike quality of the narrative without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is descriptive, it suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("gently systematic," "foxglove regret," "deserted marvels" all appear multiple times verbatim). This lexicon recycling creates a looping effect that drags momentum and draws attention to the writing artifacts rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by a few clichés ("frozen tear," "war in his eyes") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("carefully reckless"). Rhythm and flow are competent, but density is occasionally diluted by sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is mechanically sound but suffers from occasional overwriting and cliché, such as the "trembling" paper and "dappled" light/understanding. "Microscopically" in the opening sentence is a jarring, clinical word choice for a tactile sensation. The pacing is steady, though the three-day restoration is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished, but the climactic sentence suffers from metaphor stacking ("hurt like new growth, like old wounds... blooming and withering"). This density at the peak moment distracts from the raw emotional beat, trading immediacy for poetic construction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("grain swirled around a knot like water around a stone"). Sentence variety supports the pacing well. No significant scaffolding artifacts or repetitive phrasing were detected; the style suits the dream-like logic of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though the required phrase "softly ingenious" creates a clumsy adjectival stack. The rhythm is solid, but the reliance on dialogue to explain the visual climax dilutes the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm and flow are competent, but the prose is marred by specific clichés ("dissolving into mist," "eyes that held too much understanding") that flatten the texture. These artifacts detract from the otherwise high-density imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with a good sense of atmosphere ("weathered stone pillars," "whisper grew louder"). However, the text occasionally relies on abstract, purple phrasing ("calculated wilderness," "orchestrated serendipity") that tells the reader how to feel rather than showing the dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with high density, though the required prompt phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" creates a rhythmic stumble due to its length. A few similes feel stock (honey, quicksilver), but the line-level momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on cliché similes ("like gauze") and abstract nominalizations ("revelations," "wonder") that dull the imagery's precision. While rhythmically smooth, the text often tells the emotional effect of the light instead of showing the raw sensory data, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and therapy-speak artifacts ("topography of trauma," "translate pain"). Phrases like "hard softness" read as clunky oxymorons, and the density of metaphors in reflective beats occasionally obscures the emotional clarity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery ("needle dancing") and a cohesive tone. However, the reliance on abstract nouns ("hope," "persistence," "probability") to carry the climax weakens the visceral impact, and some phrases lean toward "purple" over-refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flow is severely hampered by the clumsy insertion of prompt strings. Specifically, the redundancy of "The fireplace... stopped her. Half-burned diaries spilled..." followed immediately by "Through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace..." creates a jarring paraphrase loop. The repetition of "sensitively perceptive" also degrades the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, though it occasionally leans into abstract telling for emotions ("ferocity of her longing," "straddled the line"). The descriptions of the light and sound on the terrace are the strongest technical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is functional but relies heavily on stock literary phrases ("brittle as old parchment," "faces carved by suspicion," "patient stars"). These clichés flatten the texture and prevent the writing from reaching the "flawless" standard required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the rhythm is generally good, the score is significantly impacted by proofreading errors ("carried a egg," "into a instrument") which are fatal for a "flawless" standard. Additionally, the prose leans on some clichés ("crunched like old bones") and rhetorical listing that creates a scaffolded feel in places.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but leans toward "purple" abstraction; the density of metaphor softens the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished, but the opening simile ("vast as space itself") is a cliché. The phrase "somehow in his hands" functions as a scaffold to cover a plot hole rather than a description of genuine mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant scaffolding artifacts. The imagery is precise ("scout trembling against green light"), and sentence structures vary effectively to control pacing. A few phrases border on being overly precious ("paper made from whispers"), but they fit the established aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally polished but marred by awkward prompt-forced phrasing ("technically gentle fingers" creates a semantic clash) and the verbatim repetition of "snowmelt ardor." These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is rhythmically sound and polished but relies on stock imagery ("roots... like the fingers of some sleeping giant," "churning green sea," "butterfly wing") that dilutes the vividness of the stronger lines.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from some repetitive phrasing (using "uncloaking" and "uncloaked" for the two major realizations). Some descriptors feel like "telling" disguised as description ("empirically ironic," "suffused with dusky harmony"), which distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstraction ("shifting grace," "gossamer"), which blurs the imagery. The reliance on abstract nouns to perform action ("grace moved between them") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative but leans on adjectival strings ("magnificent and terrible," "impossible colors") rather than concrete verbs in key moments. A persistent "She [verb]" sentence pattern creates a slightly monotonous cadence that limits propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean and rhythmic with good density. A few phrasings lean toward cliché ("promises fell away like apple blossoms," "had no business existing"), but the line-level craft supports the scene well without distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and functional, with strong imagery in the orchard descriptions. However, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("simply complicated," "brightened disquiet") in both the opening and closing beats feels mechanical and draws attention to the prompt rather than the story logic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is high-density and lyrical, effectively sustaining the "botanical linguistics" metaphor without confusion. Lines like "Absence had syntax; silence, declension" show strong control over imagery and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("breathing wool," "unfamiliar handwriting"), driving momentum with strong imagery. A tiny friction exists in the phrase "suddenly she saw them," which relies on a temporal leap rather than a sensory transition, but the surrounding craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and clear with some strong imagery ("reality seemed to hiccup"). However, reliance on filter verbs ("she'd found," "she understood," "she saw") distances the reader from the immediate experience. The middle section suffers from density issues due to the backstory dump.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("lightning caught in stone," "spiral around rather than consume"). The rhythm supports the pacing well, though a few phrases lean slightly into adjectival territory; overall, the line-level craft efficiently serves the atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished with good rhythm and density. A few metaphors lean toward the sentimental (e.g., "tiny parachutes of hope"), which slightly undercuts the otherwise austere literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is evocative with strong imagery ("rippled like muscle"), though the verbatim repetition of the phrase "preemptively nostalgic" creates a slight echo effect. The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing well.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is competent but frequently relies on filtering ("Mara felt," "something felt wrong") and stock similes ("thick as morning fog"). Phrases like "eyes wet with something like recognition" rely on cliché shorthand rather than fresh observation. The chanting refrain provides a nice rhythmic anchor, but the surrounding text lacks density.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong, character-specific imagery ("interior weather," "skittish octopus"). Rhythm and syntax support the reflective pacing without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, handling the required phrases well within the flow of the story. Word choices like "xenial" add texture, and the sentence variety supports the pacing, though a few descriptions lean slightly on adjectival stacking ("gold-veined and translucent").

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("noise like water holds salt") and good rhythm. However, the grammatical misuse of the required element "catalyze" as a modifier ("the catalyze effect") creates a jarring line-level artifact that disrupts the otherwise smooth texture.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but leans on stock phrases ("breath caught," "thrumming with recognition") and vague descriptors ("impossible geometries," "forgotten frequencies"). The mechanics are clean, but the density of specific, fresh imagery is lower than the setting demands.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on abstract nouns ("encroachment of teaching," "loaded emptiness" used twice). The repetition of the specific phrase "loaded emptiness" feels clumsy within this short length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery particularly in the descriptions of physical concepts (shards, residue). A few lines border on the aphoristic ("Pressure doesn't destroy. It reveals..."), but the line-level craft generally sustains the story's momentum without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose relies on a high density of "literary" stock phrases ("held its breath," "sentinel," "sound bloomed," "gathering darkness"), creating a polished but derivative texture that lacks fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is functional and flows well, but suffers from a reliance on adjective-noun pairings and stock imagery ("black velvet," "liquid starlight"). The required phrase "factually mystical" is inserted awkwardly, creating a jarring rhythm in the sentence. There are no major mechanical errors, but the density of "purple" descriptors reduces the impact of the stronger images.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally rhythmic and polished. However, moments of overwriting—specifically the double simile "like a flower, like a prayer" and the closing "settling like benedictions"—feel precious and detract from the otherwise grounded style.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and readable, with effective imagery in the descriptions of the lagoon and the hidden room. The writing maintains good momentum, though it occasionally slips into abstract labeling ("language of memory itself") instead of concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally functional but marred by forced prompt insertions ("quietly vivid increments" is clunky) and some redundancy ("radiant grotto glowed"). The repetition of "vested hush" and "prism atrium" approaches semantic satiation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("prismatic forms," "flowers from ash"). The required object phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is integrated as smoothly as possible given its clunky construction.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is high, with strong rhythm and clean mechanics; imagery is often striking ("frozen hands pointing like compass needles"). A few phrasings border on purple ("water-music," "beautiful recursion"), and the oxymoronic label "uncertainly certain" reads as a rhetorical convenience rather than a precise description of state.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by definitional slows ("kintsugi... the principle of repair") and purple phrasing ("shimmered with luminous regret"). These artifacts distance the reader during what should be visceral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is fluid and rhythmically competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and cliché in descriptive beats ("pooled like ink," "water over stones"). The phrase "modestly fearless" is an inefficient tell that blunts the immediacy of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense with imagery, effectively utilizing the equations as text artifacts. However, reliance on filter verbs ("She could feel," "She realized," "She remembered") in key moments slightly dulls the immediacy of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by stock phrasing ("practiced ease," "throat tightened") and abstract telling ("dissolve into pure concept"). Repetitive sentence structures (Name + Verb) and the reuse of roots like "crystallized" slightly dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clean but marred by clichés ("ghost of happier times," "bring the truth to light") and forced phrasing ("engaged with the ceiling") to accommodate prompt words.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished and rhythmic with high image density ("dreams negotiated terms with dawn"), though the reliance on abstract metaphor occasionally slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong sensory descriptions like "visible time churning." The rhythm supports the contemplative mood. A few phrases lean toward the slightly purple ("burnished sorrow echoed," "asteroid kept its secrets"), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("garnets for eyes," "amber of dawn"). The writing is dense and avoids mechanical loops, though phrases like "tinkersong wonder" lean slightly into ornamental preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("calcified protrusions," "interference patterns"). There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("pregnant with mineral moisture," "weeping stone"), but the line-level craft generally sustains the "resonant hush" tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose flows well with clear imagery, but is weighed down by abstract phrasing ("timewoven alliance," "spirited understanding") and telling-heavy sentences. The reliance on explaining the concepts reduces the immediacy and density of the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent but marred by stock phrasing ("exploded with color," "pulse with life") and occasional overwriting. While the rhythm is generally smooth, the reliance on adjectival description slows momentum without adding sufficient density.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("yellowed like old teeth," "seized her like a fist," "sharp as broken glass," "burning like the desert sun"). These clichés dilute the otherwise solid imagery, particularly in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose has strong rhythm and momentum, but relies on several clichés ("smooth as honey," "fallen stars," "crumble like sugar"). The required phrase "working memory" constitutes a significant register break, introducing a clinical/modern term that clashes with the established alchemical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and evocative, with high information density and no significant scaffolding. The imagery is consistent ("translucent curl," "violet sky"), and the sentence structures vary effectively to maintain momentum despite the reflective pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "breath forming crystals." The repetition of "furiously tranquil" works as a frame, though "fractals of light" and "impossible colors" lean on generic abstractions that slightly dull the peak visual moments.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythmic control. The description of the rope's vibration ("resonated... in a way that made the air shimmer") effectively conveys the supernatural physics of the world without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with clear sentence-level propulsion. However, the reliance on familiar poetic tropes (Yeats's "terrible beauty," Cohen's "cracks" sentiment) and high-density metaphorical language dampens the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("seals Silas reinforced weekly with melted wax and silence"). A few phrases lean slightly toward workshop-standard imagery ("world cracked open," "scorched breath"), but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent and dense with imagery, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("tyranny of ticking clocks," "monument to an era"). The rhythm is solid, but the reliance on the hologram's dialogue for exposition drags the momentum in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong with fluid rhythm and clear imagery. A few phrases ("red prayer of release") drift into abstraction or sentimentality, but the prose is generally controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is the story's standout strength, with crisp phrasing like "acupuncture for geology" and "ancient teeth." The prose is rhythmically sound and polished, though it occasionally lapses into scaffold-heavy summary ("She worked in a gently systematic way") to bridge time gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythmic control. Phrases like "weight like a question she couldn't yet articulate" and "shift like oil on water" do heavy lifting efficiently. The recurrence of "luminous skepticism" at the end lands with earned resonance rather than repetitive fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is evocative ("rattled like oracle bones") and rhythmically controlled, though phrases like "strange new climate" feel slightly generic against the otherwise specific texture. The final sentence leans toward sentimentality ("beauty learned to swim") but remains within the established lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by redundancy ("intuition... intuitively descriptive") and the repetition of the prompt phrase "wild hush" in two different contexts, which reads as a mechanical insertion. The ending relies on abstract summaries of emotion rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally fluid but relies on some stock phrasing ("beautiful and terrible and true," "echoed silence"). The repetition of "echoed silence" feels less like a motif and more like a lexical loop, and a few filter stacks dilute the immediacy of the observation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but suffers from occasional cliché ("wind screamed secrets") and simile stacking ("rattled like dice, like questions"). The use of oxymorons like "cautious abandon" feels like a prompt artifact rather than a precise description. Rhythm and clarity are otherwise maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong rhythmic control ("electricity through water," "dissolve like salt"). There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Mara realized," "She understood it immediately") where showing the deduction might have been sharper. The definition inserted into the first "nomadic penumbra" usage flows a bit heavily, but the second usage circles back nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory density ("scratch of wind through canyon grass"). However, it occasionally leans toward purple phrasing ("hidden thunder," "dissolve into fiction") that feels slightly ornamental rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but reliant on clichés and heavy similes ("sound like a whispered secret," "sound like wind through wheat"). The repetition of "fidgeting productively" acts as a noticeable text artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("surfaces smooth as polished ivory," "accumulated guilt"), avoiding scaffold and maintaining strong momentum. The imagery supports the tone well, though a few phrases lean slightly into adjectival density ("innocently mischievous," "contradictory symphonies").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong momentum. However, the pivotal moment relies on a tired phrase ("struck like lightning") that weakens the climax. A few abstract phrases ("dire enchantment," "glowing softly") reduce the otherwise sharp material impact of the alchemical work.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "fractured angles" and "swirls of cerulean." There is a tendency toward abstract telling in moments of high emotion (e.g., "carefully maintained remove," "temporary eternity"), which slightly distances the reader. However, the line-level density and momentum generally support the story well.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from filter verbs ("Mara felt," "She realized") and overwrought phrasing ("dew transformed each bloom into a confession"). These artifacts distance the reader and inflate the emotional register artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("fingernail scraping the sky"). However, there is a tendency toward metaphorical stacking and abstract phrasing ("slow violence of forgetting") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from filter loops in the climax ("Mara's rational mind catalogued," "The rational part of her noted"). These repetitive filters distance the reader from the action at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is strong in the opening and closing, with evocative imagery. However, the middle section suffers from dense expository summary ("silicate compounds perfect for data storage") that disrupts the established rhythm and tone. The "tell" ratio spikes significantly here.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent with moments of lyrical strength ("veins of crystalline mineral"). However, phrases like "empirically intuitive method" feel jargon-heavy for the tone, and the ending relies on abstract summaries ("infinite directions") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") and stock reactions ("stepped inside and gasped") that distance the reader. Some metaphors ("lacy menace") border on overwriting, though the visual density is good.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from prompt-forcing ("reached... with directed spontaneity" creates a jarring logical hiccup) and occasional melodramatic clichés ("tears tracked silver"). The density of similes in the opening paragraphs slows momentum without always adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and evocative ("brittle as October," "tasting copper and mountain air"). There is no scaffold or fluff; every sentence advances the atmosphere or the argument of the story. The rhythm varies purposefully to match the character’s shifting mental state, achieving a high degree of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and evocative imagery. There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("trembling calm," "infinite patience"), but the line-level craft remains strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("breath wanted to escape but couldn't, not yet"). Imagery is sharp ("captured stars," "silver scars webbing"). Some hyphenated pairings ("cloud-silence," "stone-stillness") border on stylistic affectation but do not disrupt flow.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high figurative density ("frozen prayers," "invisible symphonies," "paper ghosts") that occasionally borders on purple. The explicit labeling of the tone ("ethereal grit") in the narration breaks immersion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm is generally strong and the required phrases are integrated smoothly, reinforcing the spiral motif. However, some metaphors strain for profundity ("footsteps became philosophical statements") and rely on stock phrasing ("pregnant with revelation") that dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "line so precise it could split reality." However, some metaphors feel slightly strained ("reading forbidden text"), and the explicit explication in the finale reduces the density of the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from overwriting and abstraction, such as "desperation's topology" and "mapped... like a living constellation." The phrase "The quiet between them felt like wildfire" is a strained metaphor that pauses the scene to define itself. Thematic repetition ("holding on and letting go were both just physics") feels redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically distinct, with high information density and no visible scaffolding. Images like "flowers held raindrops like tiny prisms" and the description of equations as "graffiti" are vivid and serve the story’s tonal needs perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from purple phrasing and sentimental metaphors ("veins of the sleeping city") that distance the reader from concrete action. The density is adequate, but the reliance on poetic scaffolding softens the impact of the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, but marred by abstract emotional labeling ("grief and exultation," "haunted by absence"). The writing tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the emotion through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, with effective imagery like the ivy "curious parishioners." While there are no damaging loops or artifacts, the tendency to use explanatory scaffolding ("This was how Vera operated") slows momentum and reduces the density of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally obscures the immediate action ("syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting"). While mechanically sound, the reliance on abstract emotional metaphors weakens the visceral impact of the physical journey.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with effective imagery ("rearranging themselves like startled birds"). The writing maintains good momentum, though the climax relies slightly on summary ("The response came weeks later") rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("speaking volumes," "tears catching moonlight," "fluid grace") and purple descriptors ("scattered pearls"). The phrase "joyful sorrow" appears twice as a label, and the sentence structures often rely on abstract summaries of emotion rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    While there are strong images, the prose suffers from adjectival stacking ("fierce tenderness of delayed grief") and mixed metaphors ("volcanic tenderness rising in her throat"). Phrases like "analytically intuitive mind" function as "tell" artifacts that flatten the line-level momentum and weaken the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bloom like flowers, like ghosts"). There is a tendency toward explanatory phrasing ("This was why they'd chosen this place") that slows momentum, and the density of figurative language occasionally creates a static, observational feel rather than active propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery, particularly the "origami" container movements. There is a slight tendency toward expository phrasing ("sign of duality and choices") that tells rather than shows meaning, but the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose relies on clichés ("throat like a stone," "scattered coins") and forced adverbs ("spiralingly calm"). Several sentences serve as thematic billboards rather than active narration, and the final line is grammatically awkward.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is polished, but there is a reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("hollow quiet," "unvoiced fears") that lowers information density. The metaphor of the "unspoken words" is repeated to the point of becoming a scaffold rather than a fresh insight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("anemones bloomed like fists"). There is a slight over-reliance on oxymoronic phrasing ("tender rage," "combative tenderness") to convey complexity, but the line-level execution remains sharp and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "carving silence into smaller, more precise silences." A few metaphors feel slightly heavy ("encrusted with yesterday's optimism"), but the line-level momentum and clarity are otherwise excellent, supporting the story's stark tone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the "poet" persona. However, the density of compound-adjective metaphors ("cloud-shadow," "lantern-moth") creates a slightly ornamental texture that occasionally draws attention away from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on "telling" for key emotional and thematic beats (e.g., explaining that the reed worked "just like Mira's... paintings"). The oxymoron "innocently cunning" reads as a prompt-check rather than a coherent description. Information density is adequate but diluted by thematic summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant lexical fatigue occurs with the repetition of distinctive phrases ("powerfully gentle" twice, "golden shadows" twice) and words ("texture" three times) within a short span. Clichés like "against her better judgment" and standard filter verbs reduce line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and sensory specificity (e.g., "delicate as spiderweb," "diamond-tipped tools"). However, the density of figurative language is high, occasionally slipping into purple territory or manufactured paradoxes ("genuinely artificial," "honestly artificial resurrections") that feel slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong image density. The rhythm holds up well, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into lecture-mode ("It's inheritance") rather than naturalistic speech, slightly slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety and flow. However, reliance on stock literary phrases ("terrible beauty," "colors that had no names") and the repetition of the label "anguished joy" detract from the freshness of the imagery. The line-level craft is functional and competent but lacks the sharp, idiosyncratic unexpectedness of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with some strong images ("electrodes crowned around her temples like silver flowers"). However, it suffers from "tell-y" adjective-noun artifacts ("luminous regret," "consumer contentment") and deepity-like phrasings that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished but marred by filter verbs ("watched," "felt") and "scaffold" phrasing ("struck her like a revelation") that creates distance during key beats. Information density is good, but the reliance on simile occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative with no visible artifacts; phrasing like "tunneled sideways through space" and "peculiar meteor hush" adds texture. The rhythm effectively mirrors the slow waking and subsequent realization.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on dense simile ("like snow," "like seeds," "like a struck tuning fork") that occasionally feels ornamental. Phrasing sometimes drifts into purple territory ("perfume of dreams turned physical"), which softens the impact of the sharper, more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and abstract metaphor ("fingers of darkness and ecstasy," "liquid revelation," "shadowed rapture"). These dense, adjectival constructions clutter the imagery and distance the reader from the physical reality of the moment. The reliance on high-concept nouns (ecstasy, potential, revelation) weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("held like a specimen in amber"). However, reliance on filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "The guard felt") in pivotal moments distances the reader from direct sensation, and the syntax occasionally settles into a standard subject-verb pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("architecture of thought"). The line-level density is good, but the "pine-thoughts... sharp with old trauma" phrasing leans into therapy-speak labels that undercut the visceral impact of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but marred by stock phrasing and clichés ("settled like a blanket," "eyes burned," "dim by degrees"). While technically functional, the line-level craft misses opportunities for fresh, sensory specificity that would ground the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("prayer frozen mid-ascent"). Minor deductions for occasional "writerly" phrasing ("seraphically mundane") that calls attention to itself, but the line-level control is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjective-heavy phrasing like "regally unpretentious purpose," which feels manufactured. The rhythm is generally good, though the final paragraph leans into summary rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; the line "vigil than science" is a standout example of economy. No artifacts or loops; the sentence structures vary purposefully to match the swaying, meditative tone of the station.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("sun-memory and star-promise") and abstract. There are mechanical repetitions in blocking ("She raised the opera glasses... She lifted the opera glasses") that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and moves with purpose, avoiding major stumbling blocks. It relies too heavily on abstract summary ("Reconstruction would be stranger than anyone planned") rather than concrete details to convey the scale of change.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory details like the "crumpled photograph" and "salt wind." A few abstract phrases ("anchor optimism in realism") reduce the density, but the line-level craft generally supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("spider silk strung with stars") and abstract "telling." The repetition of the walls' movement ("shuddered," "groaned," "contracted") creates a scaffold effect that feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on some stock metaphors ("moved through honey") and heavy-handed characterization ("consciously wild grace of a predator"). The rhythm is controlled, but the "not ordinary ink... Disappearing ink" syntax feels slightly stagy.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("bravely conflicted," "within the blink that follows surprise") that disrupt the rhythm. There is noticeable repetition of key descriptors ("dizzying quiet," "echoing library") within a short space. The reliance on filter verbs ("Kael understood suddenly," "she recognized") distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but suffers from overwriting ("caught the dying sun like a held breath") and clunky, forced phrasing ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze"). These elements read as inserted artifacts rather than natural descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("words trapped... like birds in a frozen lake"). The rhythm matches the tension of the hunt. There is a slight reliance on exposition to explain the daughter's condition ("physicians called it..."), but the imagery generally carries the weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("clouds shifted like half-remembered lies"). There is a slight tendency toward adjective-heavy phrasing ("solemn meditation," "odd lightness"), but the rhythm generally supports the gravity of the scene without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from occasional overwriting ("susurration," "memories the way amber holds...") and the aforementioned diagnostic telling in the climax. The rhythm is good, but the reliance on abstract summary to explain the character's psychological state stalls the momentum at the most critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on some clichés ("half-remembered dream") and shortcuts ("socially perceptive enough"). The description of the mandala is vivid, but the abstract telling weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with standout imagery like "wind chimes made of knives." The writing is disciplined, though the phrase "warm coldness" lands as a slightly forced oxymoron that lacks the sensory precision found elsewhere in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but relies heavily on "adjective-noun" pairings ("translucent palm," "mystic orchard," "fractured timeline") that slow momentum. The synesthetic descriptions occasionally drift into abstract labeling ("mint-green possibility") rather than concrete, embodied imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery is often striking ("branching like lightning or lungs," "time-lapse flowers"), showing high visual density. The score is capped by the persistent syntactic scaffolding ("Maya [verb]" openers appear in nearly every paragraph), which creates a "list-like" texture that undercuts the otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally smooth but marred by the clumsy repetition of the phrase "factually mystical" and some expository scaffolding ("ninety percent of humanity"). The rhythm is steady but lacks variation in intensity during the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is competent and occasionally lyrical, but leans heavily on "telling" emotions and realizations ("quietly inspired," "instinct she couldn't name"). The metaphor of buttons as "constellation maps of human decision" borders on purple prose without grounding in the scene's physical reality. Momentum stalls during the explanatory passages.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean and atmospheric, but significant repetition harms the finish. The phrase "silver hush" appears twice, and the sentence about "unused courage... patient as snowfall" is repeated almost verbatim in the final paragraph, reading as a text-loop artifact rather than a purposeful refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is rhythmically competent but marred by imprecise imagery ("spindrift" on a river, "morse code" cliché) and abstract telling ("The coachman understood"). The density of adjectives and metaphors occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with high density and effective imagery ("ribbons dissolving into copper light"). There is a tendency toward aphoristic abstractions ("sharp gentleness," "clarity that doesn't wound") that verges on purple prose. The pacing is smooth, though the reliance on "thrumming" as a descriptor becomes slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the imagery is often lovely, diction errors ("footsteps instilling barely a whisper") and modifier clutter ("wistfully pragmatic acceptance") mar the prose. The reliance on abstract phrasing to convey significance weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    The phrase "atomically reflective" appears four times, and "brittle" three times, creating severe repetitive artifacts that sound robotic rather than intentional. These looped phrases drag down otherwise competent prose and break immersion during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant but occasionally overwrought, relying on dense figurative language ("joy trembling," "crystalline notes") that can feel precious. While mechanically clean, the density of adjectives and metaphors sometimes slows the reading rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("constellation emerging from light pollution"). Momentum is maintained well, though some phrasing leans on familiar genre conventions ("mathematics was elegant... and completely untested") that dampen originality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery ("starlight poured through like silver rain"). However, the use of clichéd phrasing for emotion ("coursed through her veins") and some expository heavy-lifting in the middle section detracts from the otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple lexical loops mar the prose, including the verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("furrowed hush" x2, "methodical" x2) and key verbs ("lanced" x3) within a short word count. These artifacts, combined with some overwriting, clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "nervously confident" in both the opening and climax, creating a scaffold artifact. "Spongey dread" is also inserted somewhat awkwardly as a label for internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has a strong rhythmic quality that fits the musical fiddler motif, and the imagery is often vivid. However, the text leans toward overwriting with metaphorical abstractions ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") that clutter the line-level clarity. A tighter focus on concrete action over abstract phrasing would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean with some strong imagery, but it suffers from a density of filter verbs ("Luka found himself," "he realized") that distance the reader from the moment. Occasional clichés like "a sound like a sigh" detract from otherwise sharp descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by heavy-handed metaphors and "telling," such as "something in her voice that made healing tangible." The line "Understanding dawned with the actual sunrise" is a significant coincidental artifact that weakens the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with phrases like "speech becomes air" and "charlatans dealt in surfaces; curses required roots" doing heavy lifting. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the tension of the search pattern. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is functional but relies on "telling" internal states ("understanding rippled through the gathering," "jolt of connection") rather than showing them. The repetition of the exact prompt phrase "anxious elation" as a diagnostic label weakens the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is dense and tactile ("fruit that glowed phosphorescent"), creating strong atmosphere. However, the first half relies heavily on past perfect constructions ("had cultivated," "had warned," "had traded"), which creates a slight drag on momentum before the dialogue begins.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm and density. Phrasing like "voice flat as the limestone" and "insulating himself against her disappointment" performs multiple jobs—setting tone, character, and action—simultaneously. No significant artifacts or loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from specific repetitive artifacts, notably the verbatim recurrence of the phrase "kindly methodical" and the word "haunted" in close proximity. The reliance on abstract telling ("aching beauty of change") and modifier-heavy descriptions ("impossible speed") detracts from the otherwise clean line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative, but a jarring grammatical error ("a astronomy text") disrupts the flow. Some phrasing leans toward the abstract ("smelting... of meaning") rather than the concrete, slightly reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is overwritten with heavy metaphorical padding ("geometric hearts," "frozen prayers"). "Contagion of courage" is a jarring mixed metaphor in the final beat that muddles the intended uplifting tone.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("green waterfalls frozen in time"). However, the anaphoric repetition of "The truth was" functions as an exposition dump that stalls momentum, and the phrasing "daringly methodical precision" reads as slightly contradictory adjectival clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally high-quality and evocative ("time thickening around her," "veil trailing like smoke"). However, a few filter verbs ("She understood suddenly," "She sought") and adverbs reduce immediacy in key moments. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike atmosphere well but leans occasionally on "telling" internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished and evocative. Phrases like "stains spread like continents" and "music propagating outward in waves that made flowers bloom" show high density and strong imagery. The required elements are woven into the sentences naturally, avoiding the "checklist" feel common in prompt-based work.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on adjectival stacking and stock high-fantasy imagery. The integration of prompt phrases like "lucidly watchful" feels slightly mechanical, appearing as descriptors rather than organic parts of the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic. However, the metaphor of "scalloping away barnacles" is slightly mixed/clunky, and the repetition of "vineyard hush" feels less like a motif and more like a lexical loop.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from label-stacking artifacts in key moments ("sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability, raw and real"). These abstractions obscure the physical reality of the characters' reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but the distinct phrase "sycamore hush" is repeated verbatim in paragraphs 2 and 13, creating a noticeable loop artifact. Imagery is otherwise strong ("erosion in reverse").

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("folded into itself like prayers spoken in rounds"), but occasionally lapses into abstract or mixed metaphors ("understanding bloomed... like resonance"). Sentence structures become slightly repetitive in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and image density ("light chasing itself"), but suffers from some repetitive phrasing regarding "remembering." The reliance on abstract summarization of emotion at the climax ("Teryn felt something shift") dulls the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-caliber with strong rhythm and sensory specificity ("meteor hush," "slow-burning stars"). Information density is good, and the pacing matches the action. A few phrases lean slightly expository ("The truth he hid behind was simple enough"), but the overall execution is polished and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm and distinct imagery ("laws of physics stumbled like newborn colts"). However, there are minor repetitive structures in the action beats ("static bursts came again" / "Another static burst"), and the ending leans into summary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong density ("grooves holding voices," "crystallize in the air"). However, a few phrases lean toward the generic ("dying sun," "rainbow shadows") which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp imagery. The rhythm is good, supporting the ritualistic feel of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose occasionally lapses into abstract "purple" descriptors ("shades of hope and desperation") which violate the show-don't-tell principle. The repetitive structure in the climax ("dripping rate of dew matched the dripping rate of memory matched...") reads as a slightly clunky rhetorical artifact rather than earned rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally competent, but the repetition of prompt phrases ("mirrored hush," "precisely humane") draws attention to the artifice. The final paragraph becomes abstract and dense with summary rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mechanically polished, but the prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("touch of wonder", "emergent intelligence") that tells rather than shows. The density of adjectives in the opening ("kaleidoscopic", "prismatic") slows momentum without adding proportional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from clumsy integration of required phrases that creates artifacts. "Remembering through muscle memory" is a redundant tautology, and "Being attentively inventive had always been her strength" is a "tell" sentence that disrupts flow. These forced insertions drag down an otherwise smooth narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean and dense ("cables that hummed with borrowed physics"), but the climax suffers from filter verb clustering ("felt his voice," "saw tears," "felt answering moisture") that dulls immediacy. The simile "like a blade through silk" is a cliché that detracts from the otherwise fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (using "orthogonal" twice in similar contexts) and reliance on clichés ("storm-born silence," "eternal song"). The reliance on summary telling over showing significantly reduces information density and momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is rhythmic and generally polished, with strong verb choices like "macerate" and "calcified." However, reliance on adjectival telling ("mournfully eager") and slightly repetitive extended metaphors ("symphony") prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high-density imagery ("mist suddenly resolved into shapes—towering shelves extending infinitely") that advances the narrative. The phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is clumsy and abstract, clashing slightly with the otherwise grounded sensory details. Sentence rhythm effectively mirrors the shift from feral crouching to upright walking.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("calcified into habit," "married darkness"). The phrase "the penny finally dropped" is a tonal artifact that disrupts the immersive quality. The rhythm is otherwise strong, particularly in the description of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally strains for effect with dense metaphors like "shard of hush bloomed... like an inverse symphony." Syntactic control is strong, but the reliance on slightly abstract descriptors keeps it out of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent and clear, though it relies on filter verbs ("he'd realized," "noticed") and summary during key moments. The climax lists the appearing passengers ("Mrs. Chen... Mr. Okafor...") rather than dramatizing the struggle of retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but pivotal moments rely on filter verbs ("felt the texture") and abstract summary ("viewing their own back") rather than fully dramatized sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("weight like a question she couldn't answer"). The phrase "balancedly curious" is a clunky adverb-adjective construction, but the rhythm generally supports the contemplative pacing without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is smooth but marred by clichés ("held its breath," "chest tighten") and slightly purple description. The pacing is functional, but the language does not work hard enough to create fresh imagery or subtext beyond the surface level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("rhythm like failing breath"). However, the text occasionally relies on scaffold sentences to explain character traits ("A claustrophobic spelunker was a contradiction...") or physics, rather than integrating these details purely through action and sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, particularly in the opening. However, the climax leans on slightly sentimental abstractions ("beautiful brokenness," "universe breathed") that soften the impact of the sharper, more original imagery established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lyrical and precise ("meaning dissolved into pure reverberation"), fitting the subject matter. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She knew," "She felt") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. Reducing these filters would sharpen the impact of her discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and atmospheric ("frostbitten hope"), but marred by minor flaws. "Strange microclimate" is an expository tell that flattens the immersion, and the blocking of Elena dropping the phone then immediately pocketing its antenna creates a confusing physical gap.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("roots erupted... like serpents"). However, the score is limited by reliance on abstract summaries of emotion ("poured every ounce of her longing") and the presence of explanatory scaffolding within the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with high image density ("whisper-engines," "brittle hush"). A few moments slip into "telling" labels (e.g., "respectfully rebellious" at the very end), and the repetition of the "brittle hush" phrase in the final paragraph creates a minor loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm and high clarity, but slips into cliché ("wire and prayer," "broken teeth") and occasional abstraction ("water remembering music") that weakens the imagery. The mechanics are clean, but the reliance on sentimental phrasing in peak moments dulls the literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and flows well, with strong image density in the library descriptions. The score is limited by "explanation" sentences that summarize meaning ("encoded not just information but presence") and standard transitional phrasing ("That's when she saw it").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of the prompt word "vitalize" (four times), often in awkward constructions ("vitalize what had become ghostly"). Some imagery is vivid, but phrases like "fog pressed... like a living thing" lean on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose rhythm is functional but weighed down by abstract noun stacks ("architecture of feeling") and tell-heavy metaphors. Several required phrases are inserted clumsily ("weight of enveloped secrets," "improbable longing"), disrupting the narrative flow and feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("gap in her mind like a missing tooth"). Minor diction slips like "timeframe" (a bit clinical for the tone) and some standard simile choices prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("scuffing the dusty floorboards in reverse"). The final simile ("carrying her resilience like a lantern") borders on ornamental, but the line-level execution is generally clean and dense.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is polished but leans heavily on adjectives and abstract nouns ("essence," "wonder," "hope"), creating a "purple" effect. There are repetitive phrasing artifacts ("particular quality of sound," "particular quality that made") that reduce distinctness and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with evocative phrasing like "nervous colors" and "held-breath moment." The only slight drag is the phrase "The irony wasn't lost on her," a familiar construction that feels less precise than the surrounding original imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "ghostly suggestions" and the "archaeological wound." A few abstract phrasings ("where cartography becomes faith," "shielded openness") slightly dilute the concrete impact of the visual details, but the overall line-level craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically precise, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Imagery like the "cathedral's ghost" and the deteriorating handwriting enhances the mood without obstructing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by forced prompt insertions ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert focus") that create adjective-heavy clumps. Abstract phrasings like "visual song" and "geometric whispers" occasionally drift into purple prose, obscuring concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("ribbons of gold and crimson," "patient ghosts"). High information density with no scaffold; the description of the light mechanism is precise and lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("fingerprints oxidized into permanent ghost-touch"), though occasionally heavy on adjectival stacking. The imagery consistently serves the story's dual logic of emotion and physics, avoiding empty ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished with high density ("flesh-toned abstractions"), but marred by a few clichés ("peacefully departed," "heightened stillness"). The phrase "fractally precise" is repeated verbatim, which feels like a lexical loop rather than a purposeful refrain. The description of the coin is vivid, though "meditation in metal" leans slightly purple.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is distinct and rhythmic ("twisted overhead in their thousands"). The imagery is vivid and the sentences flow well with high information density, avoiding significant artifacts or clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but marred by filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") and clunky modification ("hauntingly bright luminescence"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and fluid, with strong imagery in the opening paragraph. However, some descriptions lean purple ("blazing with spectral light"), and the "brambled hope" phrasing feels slightly overwrought. The line-level craft is competent but lacks the sharp economy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    A "Not [X], but [Y]" sentence structure appears five times ("not glass, not quite air," "not backward, not forward," etc.), creating a heavy template cadence that dulls the prose. Abstract emotion labels like "bruised awe" also reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally evocative with high density ("fruit that screamed"), maintaining momentum throughout. Occasional phrasings like "menacing curiosity" and "eternal silent warnings" lean slightly into adjectival telling, but clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean but relies on stock phrasing at pivotal moments ("pieces began falling into place," "flooded her mind," "solid thing blocking her throat"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of the climax, reducing the density and freshness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythm. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("mindfully scattered," "deliberately forgotten"), but the imagery of the moonlight pooling like mercury effectively anchors the abstractions in concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and evocative without becoming purple ("antiseptic of truth," "ice began to weep"). Line-level craft is high, with strong information density and imagery that serves the narrative logic. No significant artifacts or loops; the rhythm supports the story's emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt keywords ("vigorous, tender") and the noticeable repetition of the "borrowed starlight" phrase. These artifacts suggest scaffolding rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though occasionally adjective-heavy ("silver light in chaotically precise patterns"). The mandatory phrase "quaking reverie" stands out as slightly purple but is integrated grammatically.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high-quality imagery like &quot;mist clung to the entrance like cobwebs&quot; and &quot;stone tears.&quot; Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the inversion effects, though the label &quot;prism-minded&quot; feels slightly repetitive by its second appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety. However, the use of stock imagery (spider-webbed cracks, bleeding fingers) undermines the freshness of the line-level work in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and readable but suffers from significant lexical repetition (forms of "impossible" appear four times; "beauty/beautiful" five times) and adverbial clustering ("thoughtfully, precisely" is repeated). These echoes dull the precision of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished with strong imagery ("breathing and being breathed by the world"). Phrasing is generally dense and evocative, though "intuitively descriptive touch" reads as a slightly awkward forced insertion. The description of silence having "textures" is executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but suffers from heavy "telling" and abstract description ("grotesque glory," "meticulous care"). The awkward and repeated usage of "journalize" creates a jarring artifact that detracts from the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains momentum with some strong imagery ("water... forming a sphere"). Occasional stock phrasing ("thunderous silence," "impossible geometry") and summary bridges flatten the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is competent but relies on repetitive subject-verb sentence openers ("Mara walked," "Mara began," "Mara's training," "Mara looked"), creating a mechanical rhythm. The phrase "hazy precision" is used twice, which feels like a visible prompt insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has high imagery density but relies frequently on filter verbs (&quot;Kael felt,&quot; &quot;Kael heard,&quot; &quot;Kael knew&quot;) that distance the reader from the immediate sensation. Sentence structures in the latter half become repetitive, often starting with &quot;Kael&quot; or &quot;He,&quot; creating a monotone cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. Phrases like "folding into inaccessible distance" and "failure, hoarded and examined" do double duty for plot and character. Minor deduction for the slightly generic somatic phrasing "Relief crashed through her," but overall execution is high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("grief exists in a clenched jaw"), though occasionally "tell-y" regarding the mechanics of the printing ("would disorient readers"). The density of imagery supports the tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with high clarity and good rhythm ("steady feet and steadier hands"). There are minor instances of filter verbs ("Kessa saw," "Kessa understood") that distance the reader slightly during key realizations. The repetition of the "fade from memory to myth" phrase works as a refrain, though it borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and descriptive, though it occasionally leans on telling emotional states ("crushing grief," "shattering of deeply held beliefs") rather than trusting the imagery to convey them. The line-level rhythm is solid, though the integration of prompt phrases is sometimes visible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry") and redundant phrasing ("began to recommence"). The clumsy integration of required phrases disrupts the rhythm, particularly the oxymoronic description of tears and beads.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Momentum is strong, but the prose relies on several cliché phrases ("impossible blue," "broken promises," "forgotten how to dream") that dampen the freshness of the imagery. Additionally, the required element words ("deliberate," "azure") echo repetitively within a short span, creating a slight scaffold effect.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from metaphorical stacking ("negative sound mapped itself... in shades of rust") and some repetitive phrasing (variations of "map/mapped" appear frequently). The phrase "question tasted like ash" is a cliché that flattens the emotional beat. The prompt-required phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is integrated grammatically but feels slightly clunky in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from telling over showing, using abstract nouns ("gratitude," "goodbye") to convey emotional states. Phrases like "blue as forgetting" and "painful as lamp oil" register as writerly flourishes that obscure clarity. The logical contradiction of placing the glass on the cairn and then pocketing it in the next breath is a significant choreography artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm and flow are strong, with effective imagery ("drank it, held it"). There is a tendency toward telling over showing in the reflective beats ("tingled with unintended significance"), but line-level craft is otherwise solid.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lyrical and dense, with strong imagery ("confessions people kept locked behind their ribs"). However, it leans toward overwriting (purple prose) and occasionally uses self-referential similes ("steam rose like valley mist" in a valley of mist) that weaken the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with strong imagery ("scattered like prophecy"). The simile "like data in amber" creates a slight register clash with the established "stone and sextant" aesthetic, but the overall rhythm and clarity are high.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory details like "luminous moths." A few phrases ("frequencies of her voice") drift into a slightly technical register that clashes with the elemental tone, but the line-level craft is generally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and slightly purple descriptors ("enlarged tranquility," "ancient eyes"). The density of telling—summarizing emotional states and philosophical concepts—drags on momentum, though the line-level mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density in descriptions like the "smooth expanse of wall." The phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a slight register clash, though the attribution to the grandmother attempts to smooth it; overall, the line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong imagery like "breath forming constellations." However, the required attribute "gently meticulous" appears twice verbatim, creating a minor repetitive artifact. The density is generally high, though some phrasing leans slightly abstract ("static of forgetting").

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong sensory imagery. However, the prompt-mandated phrase "curiously steadfast determination" introduces a weak adverb-adjective stack that momentarily drags the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, but the repetition of the distinct phrase "terrestrially cosmic" (paragraphs 1 and 10) creates a noticeable echo. Some compounding ("copper-promise") leans purple, but the line-level momentum remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and adjectival clutter ("reverent hands," "auroral sorrow," "flagellation"). Line-level craft prioritizes poetic effect over clarity and momentum, resulting in a texture that feels more ornamental than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("leaves... caught the filtered amber light") and high information density. The writing avoids major artifacts, though some phrasing leans towards the sentimental ("slow suffocation of hope").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from grandiloquence ("laws deeper than intention," "pure transmission of feeling") that tells the reader how to feel rather than showing the experience. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Mara knew," "They heard") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory reality of the bell-song.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and precise, but the prompt phrase "strangely organic" is repeated five times verbatim in a short space. This creates a significant text artifact that disrupts immersion and signals the prompt mechanics too glaringly.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but suffers from the repetitive use of the "sandstorm" motif (appearing in description, dialogue, and metaphor), which reads as a lexical loop. Phrasing like "liminal hours" and "discerning curation of compassion" feels like stock literary scaffolding rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("slow colonization of rust," "fear crystallized"). The rhythm supports the dance motif effectively, though a few phrases hover on the edge of being slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-value imagery ("constellations of water droplets," "drifting inland like soap bubbles"). The refrain of "gleaming silence" effectively sets the tonal bracket for the piece, though the "answer came in the morning" transition is slightly less texturally rich than the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but suffers from awkward phrasing required by the prompt elements (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic alignment," "tranquil blaze"). These phrases disrupt the rhythm and feel inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of the phrase "patiently nimble" (and "patient nimbleness") four times in a short piece. This loop acts as a distracting artifact that breaks immersion and signals a lack of line-level editing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of key phrases ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") in close proximity, creating noticeable echoes. Abstract descriptors ("resonance structures," "living architectures") often replace concrete showing, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing of prompt elements, creating a scaffolded feel. "Heritage rose thorn" appears four times, "stalactites dripped" four times, and "pearl twilight" three times in a short space; this verbatim repetition stalls momentum and lowers the sense of craft polish.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is competent but leans on "telling" ("richly perceptive eyes") and abstract summarization. The insertion of the phrase "progressive disclosure" constitutes a significant register break, reading like corporate jargon in a mythic setting.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory details, but the dialogue functions as expository monologue addressed to an empty room, and occasional filter verbs ("Maya felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with good information density. However, the prompt-mandated phrase "scintillatingly somber" creates a register clash, and there are moments of "telling" (e.g., "Chen had learned that...") that flatten potential scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("terrible mosaic") and telling ("sharply observant gaze"). The required action "intuit" is used awkwardly as a verb to bypass showing the investigative work, and the pacing during the middle section feels summary-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentence craft is competent, with some strong sensory lines, but the prose relies on "telling" adjectives to assert tone ("gritty and strange and perfectly, whimsically true") instead of evoking it through imagery. There is a tendency toward abstraction over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, but marred by a clumsy repetition ("recording recorded") and the awkward insertion of required phrasing ("positively wistful").

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong density and evocative imagery ("groaned," "thrumming"). There is a slight reliance on telling over showing in the character introduction ("logically emotional, her wife called her"), and the "literally now" phrasing in the climax is a jarring tonal break.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but suffers from some overwriting and abstract similes (e.g., "dissipated like ghosts of old impatience"). Adverb-heavy phrases like "softly purposeful steps" dilute the impact of the action, though the rhythm is generally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive usage of prompt terms; "reverberate" appears four times in a short space, becoming a distraction. Clichés like "metallic tang of fear" and "whispered warnings" weaken the line-level quality. The sentence rhythm is functional but lacks the distinct texture of a high-literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by overwritten metaphors ("understanding arriving by the way light breaks...") and clunky prompt integration ("aptly deliberate care"). The dialogue often sounds like written speeches rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and atmospherically dense ("prophecies written in refracted light"), with strong rhythmic control. Imagery is specific and avoids cliché, though the density of abstract descriptors ("future's architecture," "prophetic geometries") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, integrating required phrases like "echo of forgotten songs" seamlessly into the atmospheric description. Imagery is specific and dense ("edges frayed," "surgical precision"), and there are no distracting artifacts or loops. The writing supports the story's momentum without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but relies on filter verbs ("Kael believed," "Kael understood") and telling modifiers ("calmly intuitive") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The imagery is often strong, but the reliance on abstract emotional summaries weakens the scene's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally high-caliber, with strong phrasing like "goodbyes distributed like unwanted gifts" and "wounded heirloom." However, "symphony of cracking bergs" in the opening is a slightly worn metaphor, and the final simile ("like a blessing") softens the otherwise sharp imagery. The rhythm effectively mirrors the "dissolution and persistence" of the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally fluid but marred by clunky abstractions ("passion had literally consumed reason") and forced terminology. These artifacts distance the reader during what should be the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "truth cut straighter paths." Minor filtering artifacts ("Maya felt," "began to sense") distance the reader slightly from the immediate tactile experience of the magic, but the line-level craft is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically competent, with clear visual stacking. However, it relies on some abstract metaphors and clichés ("worry hung thick as smoke") that dilute the freshness of the imagery. The "began to" filter constructions in the climax slightly distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans on stock phrasing ("held its breath," "shatter certainty," "pooling shadows"). The list of evolving words provides a nice textural density that breaks the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from "workshop purple" tendencies, relying on abstract, heavy-handed metaphors ("tidal longing," "cells whispered their slow surrender") instead of concrete imagery. The dialogue often sounds written rather than spoken, disrupting the natural rhythm of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, though it leans toward "purple" modifiers in the final third ("briefly, beautifully visible," "impossibly far"). The repetition of "changelessly constant" and "luminous ache" (while required elements) creates a slight echo effect that draws attention to the construction rather than the image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    While grammatically clean, the prose is weighed down by purple abstractions and mixed metaphors ("silence... calcified," "scent of hope"). The reliance on "precious" phrasing ("hymning the mundane," "radiant haven") obscures concrete detail, resulting in a text that feels polished but ornamental rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose density is exceptional; phrases like "causation caught its own tail" and "stars that had learned to whisper" convey complex world-building efficiently. Rhythm and propulsion are maintained throughout, with no visible artifacts or padding.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally smooth and evocative, with good rhythm. However, the final paragraph contains a jarringly forced phrase ("bloomed its nostalgic innovation") that disrupts the semantic logic of the sentence. Some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("harmonics that made her teeth ache").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is generally smooth but suffers from abstract metaphors ("zephyr bloom of possibility") and clunky phrasing ("reflectively vibrant") that appear to be forced. The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("perfectly calm, perfectly still") occasionally dulls the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("irregular constellations," "tomb of technology"). Rhythm is handled well, though a few phrases ("honeyed hush") skirt the edge of being overly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and imagery ("churning white," "suggestions"). The integration of prompt phrases is generally seamless, though "lucidly watchful" feels slightly stiff. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally leans into "purple" descriptors ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush"). There is some filtering ("she felt," "she saw") that distances the reader from the immediacy of the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but marred by a few scaffolds ("not metaphorically, but literally") and repetitive abstract phrasing regarding her patience ("patience made physical," "embodied patience"). These slight drags on momentum prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and evocative, with high information density and no artifact loops; the imagery ("gears splayed like wings") supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is atmospheric and dense, but relies heavily on hyphenated modifiers ("winter-held," "boundary-lessly," "burden-weight"). While "boundary-lessly" is a prompt constraint, the reliance on similar compounds creates a slight textural drag.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from lexical repetition; "patient" or "patience" appears four times ("patient authority," "patient repetition," "particular patience," "patient rain"), and "particular" appears twice. These echoes distract from the otherwise clean rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm is solid, but the text relies on sensory and metaphorical clichés ("regret tasted like copper," "slipped through her fingers") that dull the line-level impact. These artifacts prevent higher placement despite clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies on stock phrases ("dust motes danced," "sang with possibility") and abstract telling ("stoic wonder") instead of concrete imagery. The reliance on summary for the central action drains momentum and density from the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts. The seven-syllable phrase "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times, and "glacial hush" three times, creating a noticeable loop that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally evocative but marred by awkward prompt insertions ("thoughtfully clear precision") and some cliché phrasing ("washed through him like cold water"). The repetition of "serene upheaval" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory imagery ("dissolving... with a whisper"). While some phrasing feels slightly precious ("philosophical seed collector"), the line-level craft supports the atmospheric tone effectively without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a few darling phrases and high metaphor density. Notably, the phrase "lonesome splendor" appears in both a dialogue tag and the narration, a repetitive artifact that breaks the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("filaments that caught the light like fiber optics"). However, the text suffers from a few awkward, likely prompt-forced phrases ("hypothesizing about everything," "bitterly sweet achievement") that disrupt the rhythm and feel tell-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically competent, though it leans toward purple phrasing ("kelp-drift peace," "ancient migration"). While technically clean, the earnestness of the metaphors occasionally stifles the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery (&quot;stuck between moments like an insect in amber&quot;). There is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing to explain plot mechanics (&quot;forgetting the act of release&quot;) which slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally high. The &quot;defiant hush&quot; and &quot;singing fountains&quot; border on purple but fit the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, with high density and strong imagery. Minor lyrical excesses (e.g., "quiet sigh" in a vacuum) are accepted as POV perceptions, though they skirt the edge of purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and self-conscious literary devices ("passing words... like bread"). Phrases like "thundering calm" and "fiercely meditative" read as strained efforts to force gravity rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is atmospheric but marred by noticeable repetition of key descriptors ("searing," "impossible," "eternal") within a short space. Additionally, phrases like "laws of physics held their breath" lean toward cliché, reducing the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but leans into purple descriptors ("star-lanced," "velveteen gloom," "moth wings") that call attention to themselves. The phrase "indifferent stars" in the final paragraph is a cliché that weakens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from adverb-heavy phrasing and slightly purple descriptions ("trembling threshold where possibility still breathed"). The required phrase "groundedly imaginative" is inserted as an awkward modifier that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density; occasional slightly overwrought phrasing ("irony pleased her with its thistled calm") fits the style but draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("working in near darkness, her fingers remembering"), with high information density. While generally strong, phrases like "voice like wind through hollow reeds" and "forgotten places" lean slightly into cliché, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with high information density and striking imagery (e.g., the chronometer description). Rhythm is controlled. The score is held back by a few instances of explanatory scaffolding ("This was why he agonized...") where the narrative tells the reader how to interpret the character's emotion instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from decorative overwriting ("wore autumn like a shawl") and cliché ("voice like clear water"). The repetition of "velvet" (library, embrace, air) and "traveled stillness" creates unintended lexical redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and readable but relies on abstract adjectival phrases ("metallic determination," "willful ignorance") that distance the reader from the physical action. Some descriptions feel like "scaffolding" rather than direct observation, but the rhythm generally supports the story's pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is distinct and flows well with good sensory details and rhythm. Line-level craft is solid and error-free, though the pacing feels somewhat sluggish due to the lack of dramatic friction or urgency in the scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though some metaphors strain for effect ("hushed blaze," "shards of hush"). The line-level craft supports the dreamlike tone effectively, despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("water around her trembled with consequences"). A noticeable grammatical slip ("hope that threading through despair") and repetitive sentence subjects (Marina/The woman) dampen the flow and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("fingers tracing equations," "vertical infinity"). The forced inclusion of the prompt phrase "balancedly daring" results in a minor clunky moment ("climbing with balancedly daring steps"), but the surrounding text supports it well enough to maintain immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though it leans on some stock phrasing ("smog-choked," "familiar gauze," "liquid" moonlight). The density is appropriate for the length, maintaining momentum without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Phrases like "time pooled like standing water" and "dread itself wore a pleasant mask" work hard to establish tone. The integration of required phrases is seamless, avoiding the feeling of a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("neatly inventive" and "bleak exhilaration" both appear twice in a short space; "latent radiance" three times). These repetitions read as forced insertions rather than organic descriptors, creating a "scaffold" effect that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished with strong density ("blurred at the edges like an overexposed negative"), though it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("silk dragged across broken glass") and adverb-heavy telling at the climax ("gloriously, impossibly alive"). The "unbosom" prompt is integrated smoothly into the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from significant lexical looping: "sketch" appears four times in varied contexts, and the distinctive phrase "restless euphony" is repeated twice (para 6, para 10), creating a jarring echo. These artifacts disrupt the immersive quality of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is high-quality with strong information density and evocative phrasing ("sunwashed dread," "hinges had fused with salt and time"). The rhythm supports the pacing well, accelerating appropriately during the revelation and slowing for the heavy, final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and readable with some strong imagery ("fingers from the past"). However, the text leans on clichés at key moments ("pit of lies," "cost everything," "heart ached"), which dampens the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally veers into slightly purple territory ("columns listing like drunken dancers"). The technical integration of the surveying details with the emotional narrative is generally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean and functional, with good rhythm in the action beats. However, the forced insertion of prompt phrases like "dappled resolve" creates awkward metaphorical confusion (resolve can be dappled, but here it reads as an artifact). Some phrasing leans toward adjectival telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("crystalline spires," "blazed like a captive star"). However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Mira understood finally") and the slight "purple" quality of the prompt phrases hold it back from higher density.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The exact repetition of the phrase "bleak exhilaration" (paragraphs 6 and 16) creates a noticeable scaffold loop that breaks immersion. While the prose is generally dense and propulsive, "intangibly tangible" reads as a slightly clunky prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition artifacts harm the prose quality: "sharp eyes" (x2), "perpetually surprised" (applied to both Mara and the Pilgrim), and "brilliant dimness" (x2). These echoes in a short text create a template-like feel.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. The integration of required phrases is generally smooth, though the explication following "sieved hush" feels slightly like scaffolding to justify the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with good momentum. A few phrasings lean on familiar literary collocations ("rang hollow," "calcified into permanent scars," "time and tempest"), preventing a higher score for freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished but leans into heavy reliance on pathetic fallacy (fog like regret, singing dock, humming poles). The phrase "merrily melancholic" feels forced in both instances, creating a rhythmic stumble that highlights the constraint rather than flowing naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative ("impossible ink on cowhide"), driving the narrative forward efficiently. There are occasional lapses into overwriting ("irony tasted like rust") and the repetition of the specific prompt phrase "delicately robust" draws attention to itself as an artifact rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("pollen that glittered like crushed stars"). Line-level craft is polished, though occasionally the adjectival density and metaphors ("absorbed dying screams") skirt the edge of being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("moon hung low like a lantern"), but relies on a few cliché similes ("scattered like leaves," "pooling like water") that dampen the freshness of the imagery during pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("tiny galaxies," "spider silk"). Minor filter verbs ("Ren knew," "Ren glimpsed") appear occasionally, but the overall rhythm and clarity are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("exhaled heat"), though the density is occasionally diluted by abstract labeling of emotions ("vibrant hush"). Rhythm is generally good, supporting the atmospheric intent without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and readable with good rhythm ("darkness swallowed everything"). Some phrasing leans toward stock imagery ("holding them like a promise," "iron grip"), but the technical execution is clean with no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with evocative imagery, particularly regarding movement and light. However, the climax leans on filter verbs and abstract summarization ("She saw it then," "It was about") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant density of metaphor and "purple" phrasing ("fractured the horizon," "braille of survival," "ghosts finding form"). These artifacts obscure the immediate action and create a melodramatic texture that detracts from the gravity of the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose leans heavily on abstract similes ("steady as philosophy itself") and oxymoronic flourishes ("symphony of dignified chaos") that border on purple. Adverb-adjective clusters ("diplomatically fierce," "halting it absolutely") and tell-y metaphors ("wrestled visibly") weaken the line-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, though it occasionally leans into sentimental descriptors ("diamond-sharp," "luminous"). The final summary impedes the momentum, trading scene-based storytelling for essayistic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and flows well, with strong imagery in the fantasy sequence. There is a tendency toward adjective-heavy phrasing ("purposeful strides," "ethereal light," "steely longing") that occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally competent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The repetition of distinct, polysyllabic phrases ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt") within a short word count acts as a distracting text artifact. These repetitions read as crutches rather than intentional motifs, marring otherwise clean prose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting dampens the scene's immediacy; similes like "waves that had learned patience" read as decorative rather than functional. The insertion of modern diagnostic language ("diffuse the pain," "acknowledge its source") into the grandmother's magical message creates a jarring tonal anachronism.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., polishing reveals "inner architecture" advancing craft and metaphor); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful repetition (descend/ascend) taught early; zero loops, no figurative muddle in peak crane-folding.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density propels with varied rhythm, no loops; minor explanatory density slips mid-story but not in peak "coalesce" closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density integrates action and image propulsion, varying rhythm; minor repetition of "perpetually surprised" and "brilliant dimness" borders loop but serves motif without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion weaves reflection into action (e.g., "Sift through his work"); final line recharges cobalt sky motif cleanly.

    Zero loops, high density propels from "scuffed leather" to lake pulse; rhythmic variation peaks in revelation without figurative muddle or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with purposeful figurative layering (scents forming smiles); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops, though minor spice-list density risks overwrite without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "cards scattered like leaves, forming... 'time's true shape'"); varied rhythm passes ear test, but minor overwriting in glade opener ("choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest") risks figurative density without peak payoff, slightly dulling entry propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density integrates action/image (e.g., "needle...fine as spider silk" propels stitching). Varied rhythm avoids loops; metaphors coherent/purposeful ("patchwork quilt"). No scaffolds; final line recharges Tear motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    High density with propulsion—"lightning bugs spiraled upward... creating temporary constellations" does image/action/charge in one; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherent (volcanic "exhaled heat"); read-aloud ear clean.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with concrete noun or motion, avoiding template cadence. Information density high—each line layers sensory data and metaphoric freight. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Minor scaffold: “had come here every day… not to salvage… but to observe” is efficient backstory, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One paraphrase loop (“meaning…meaning” inside 30 words) spotted but does not touch closure, so −0.2. Metaphors stay within glass/heat/frost continuum—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending with tactile heat → evaporative sound. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences breathe: opening clause suspends across frost-pattern, then three short beats of palm-press, breath-fail, glass-cold. No scaffold; “perpetual frost patterns that never melted” does not rephrase elsewhere. Metaphors are spare and physical—frost as cathedral, heat as map—never layered into purple. Final line “She began mapping her own face” is monosyllabic, letting the starkness serve as cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic—“distress signals... layering over each other in cascading light.” Mixed metaphors are avoided; kelp/barnacle/lens imagery stays coherent. A few adjectival stacks (“impossible spaces seemed thinnest”) approach overwriting but remain purposeful. No loops or scaffold detected; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with changing parts of speech, no template churn. Figurative layer is selective (“moonlight like whispered secrets”) and never clots action. One mixed metaphor—“silver thread trying to stitch scattered fabric”—but it lands mid-story and doesn’t obscure the final image. High information density: single clauses carry motive, sensory, and thematic freight; no scaffold loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift from participial to subject-verb. Density is high—“dark and knotted like roots” does triple duty: visual, tactile, emotional. One paraphrase loop noted above costs −0.2. No scaffolding, no synonym churn elsewhere. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without overwriting. Metaphors stay coherent under inversion physics.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong rhythmic control: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density high—“three years since the regime branded her a traitor for smuggling hope” compresses backstory with motive. Figurative language sparse and coherent; “chains like ribbons” appears once and pays off in final release. No loops or synonym churn. Minor overworld: “soft percussion” and “singing” are close cousins but compressed in one phrase, forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density high—single sentences braid sensory, mechanical, emotional work: “she held the cast … violet-edged keen that tasted like autumn.” No scaffold or synonym loops; each forge verb is distinct (fed, heated, cooled, struck). Metaphors stay physically coherent (kelp-in-current seconds) and are not stacked in climax. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt memories crystallizing”) appear once but inside a reflection block already anchored to apple taste—does not dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet image-rich; most sentences advance either light-action or interior turn. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors stay consistent within the optics motif. A single mixed image—“voice like rustling petals”—is fleeting enough not to dull the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “frost-rimed window” does triple duty—weather, body, metaphor. No loops; sentences vary openings and length. One mixed metaphor (“quiet violence of ice surrendering”) is earned by context; register stays consistent. Final paragraph propels via image-chain rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dread, staccato for officers’ arrival. Figurative language is selective and paid off: “oxidized shelves = skeletal fingers” returns as Carson’s grasp fails. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Minor register drift—Maya thinks “conceptual repricing” is unlikely mid-crisis, yet the phrase never appears; prose stays within stunt-performer perceptual range. Only one near-paraphrase: “trembling certainty” is stated twice; the second could be cut for density.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence layers silence-as-substance without metaphor pile-up. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“hush” thrice in 5 lines) but the repetition is pattern-taught, hence waived. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One register hitch: “conceptual repricing” is editor-meta vocabulary, not Maren’s, but it appears inside closure beat and slightly jars the lyric register, keeping the score under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences perform setting, character, concept. No loops or scaffold; figurative language spare and pattern-taught (“sweeping ice into patterns that would freeze again”). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. One mixed-metaphor risk—“sound that wanted to become music”—is paid off by conceptual closure, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid, loop-free, with high information density: “translucent tiles catching the lamplight in fractured rainbows” does visual and symbolic work. Sentence variety is deliberate; no template cadence. Metaphors stay internally coherent (light = evidence). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor scaffold: “after words became unnecessary” is prompt-recycling, not scene-born; a −0.2 artifact, but it does not touch climax. No grammatical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and earned—“cracks into copper veins” charges closure. Information density high: one sentence toggles past sabotage, present polish, future wager. Minor filter verbs remain voice-justified (“she watched”) rather than clutter. No artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “light that felt somehow both cold and warm” compresses paradox without purple. No synonym loops; each sensory detail is new. Occasional template cadence—“They’re magnificent tonight,” he murmured… his breath fogging…”—slows momentum mildly. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene shifts, accelerating at lever pull.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clean, vivid, and propulsive, with strong sensory anchoring and purposeful metaphor. However, several micro-loops and near-repetitions mildly dull momentum: “water damage had created images… They looked almost intentional, as though the water had been guided by invisible hands” restates the same idea twice; “in-between space” phrase recycles four times in two paragraphs; “lately inspired by dreams…” is told, not shown. These small artifacts don’t fracture causality but accumulate enough to keep the score just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “probability margins too small to warrant alarm” compresses science, stakes, and moral failure in seven words. Rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks that mirror dawn lightening. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Swallowed a truth” is the only minor cliché, but it’s earned by fever metaphor and doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Momentum is high: every sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. No synonym loops; “drowsy alertness” appears once and crystallizes state. Metaphors are coherent (wool, honey, sediment) and tied to mill imagery. Minor scaffold: “She continued deeper… the tunnel opened into…” is functional transition rather than clutter. Final clink of valve wheel provides auditory closure, avoiding generic last-line uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet never purple; metaphors (ink as soil, silence as hum) stay coherent with ecosystem logic. Minor template cadence in “she had watched… she had witnessed…” loop (−0.2). Information density is high—each sentence at least doubles duty (setting + interiority, or object + theme). Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive—no scaffolding loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent (light descent, roots dreaming). Sentence variety: short anchoring opens, then elongating cadence under eclipse dark. Information density is high—each line sets atmosphere or advances relationship without padding. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to be remembering”) but it is voice-motivated and early, not under peak pressure. Final line lands with quiet percussive echo.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences perform double duty—e.g., “enough remained… dreams began to fail” compresses exposition into sensory ash. Occasional elevated diction (“torqued reality,” “conceptual spindle”) risks register excess yet remains within the historian’s erudite ken. One paraphrase loop—“silence that followed noise… bronze quiet”—is minor. Closure line is clean, no artifact touches it.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Varied sentence openings, no template cadence; information dense (“thirty-seven years… microdot… obsolete now”). Metaphors clean and consistent (jazz, lighthouse, tide). Zero paraphrase loops; final line re-energizes “familiar enigma” without redundancy. Clean grammar, pronoun reference, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence layers ritual action with metaphysical stake (“decorates with silence” does triple duty). Metaphors precise (“cathedrals of quiet”), no mixed vehicles. One tiny scaffold: “the silence decorated the space…” sentence re-states prior image, but cadence requires the pause; forgivable. Zero grammatical hits; final line lands with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—prism, spiral, conductor—each reappears to tighten theme without clutter. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested for propulsion. One near-loop: “mirrored horizon…mirror-world” repetition is purposeful, pattern-taught, paid off in dissolution image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “rainwater dripping upward past her boots” packs motion, orientation, and world-rule in eight words. Rhythm modulates—long anaphoric chains of timelines give way to abrupt final declaratives, propelling the close. One mixed metaphor cluster (“labyrinth...minotaur...recursion with no base case”) is earned by context and does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold detected; information density stays high. Slight overuse of Latinate abstractions (“phosphorescence,” “procedural generation”) keeps it from the 9+ band where every barb must feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmospheric data) without scaffold. Figurative language sparse and precise: “ivy climbing…in darkening cascades” fuses visual with temporal decay. No loops, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase echo—“her integrity…she recorded facts; she didn’t take sides”/“this was her integrity”—is close enough to notice, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density—“lantern broker,” “crystal perfume vial,” “extinct blooms” each do double duty of world and psyche. Metaphors stay consistent (light/dark, vessel/flame). No register drift; “molecular structures” fits ex-lantern authenticator. Final line cadence slows to match enduring grief without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught—“concentric circles becoming spirals becoming fractals”—paid off in the liquid wall. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, musical, and propulsive—no filler, no scaffold loops. Figurative language (jewel in crown, invisible company) is sparse and purposeful, never crowding the acoustical beats. Sentence rhythm modulates with scene breath. Only minor paraphrase near “constant quiet” line; not enough to dull closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no over-modification.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences deliver occupation, tool, emotional physics, and moral stakes. Figurative language is sparse and integrated—“jagged purple lightning” is literal within the story’s rule-set, not ornamental. Zero scaffold loops; no two adjacent sentences restate content. Rhythmic variation supports tempo: long lyrical opener, clipped procedural close. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the filing motion echo without metaphoric overload.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors appear. Occasional elevated diction (“the rhythm of hands and hearts”) is earned by the lyrical close and stays within Marlena’s reflective register. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the musical metaphor without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: opening catalog of travel slows to “perched at the crater’s edge,” then accelerates through nightly searches via paratactic “They began searching in pairs and trios.” Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in 750 words—preventing purple drift. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Final line’s “luminescent ache” recycles earlier adjective but now re-weighted by closure, earning the repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences layer job, world, and stake—“Her infinity symbol pendant hung cold against her chest, its weight reminding her of the bargain she’d made.” No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise, and motif-consistent (echoes, cadence, time as honey/wire). Opening and closing lines are texturally linked through the anticipatory echo. One filter-verb cluster (“She heard… She heard…”) is voice-motivated and paid off, so no artifact penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, concept, or emotion. Metaphors (tears as grout, patience as taste) stay physically coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in 15 words; final line crystallizes the new equation without exposition. Density is high—e.g., “water had worn away her smile but left her eyes intact” performs erosion, memory, and thematic setup in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences cache backstory (“eleven months…disappear”), anchor time (“4:47 AM”), and advance plot. No metaphor loops or mixed vehicles; “sapphire hush” is repeated once, purposeful and paid off. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for library hush, fragment for grate creak. Copy-clean: no tense slips, pronoun drift, or scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from stately openings (“Marcus stood…”) to shorter, breath-cut clauses during wire removal, mirroring tension release. Metaphors stay vegetal and precise—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can layer sensory detail, memory, and causal nudge (“The wires had cut into the bark…”). Occasional scaffold (“somehow more alive”) is minor; no loops obscure causality. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, strong verbs. Final line lands with cadential lift that re-circuits earlier rain-and-leaf imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high density: “she worked to thresh meaning from experience, to press sense from the sediment of survival” performs double duty (theme + tactile action). Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“golden catastrophe”—is earned by context. Final paragraph’s iterative anaphora (“the way… the way…”) is purposeful, taught by earlier tidal repetition; no artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid yet disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Figurative density peaks only after the pearl ignites, justified by spectacle. One paraphrase loop—“shadows that shouldn’t exist… overlapping shadows”—is minor and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean read-aloud rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—“limestone cliffs still wept” layers setting, weather, emotion. Sentence variety supports propulsion. Final trumpet image crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is taut, imagistic, high-density; sentences multitask (“The mist grew denser, swirling into architectural forms…”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance. A single register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—appears but fits the lyric mode. Closure beat is crystal-clear; therefore 9+ band remains open with only a hairline deduction for “impossible configurations” echoing twice in close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long sinuous sentences mirror whale song, staccato clauses during tile shifts. No mixed metaphors; ‘frequencies just beyond human perception that made the ancient observatory hum’ is precise. One paraphrase loop: ‘memories crashed… not her own’ / ‘she saw through Amit’s eyes’ could merge. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric density is high, but metaphor logic stays coherent; no contradictory vehicles. A few template cadences—“the fragment burned. / Vesper stood … the fragment burned hotter”—create rhythmic stack, yet repetition is pattern-taught, paying off in final pulse. Information dense, largely propulsive; minor scaffold in “magnetic fields were creating…” constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is high-density and loop-free; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “truth like clay,” “mathematics of a fair trade.” No filter-verb stacks; verbs are mortician-strong (“rinsed,” “documented,” “forecloses”). Rhythm breathes with vigil fatigue—long sentences at 2 a.m., staccato at 4 a.m. when the capsule surfaces. Copy-clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense but breathing: “lamp's frequency shifted...a fingerprint of time itself” fuses metaphor and exposition. No mixed metaphors; “pink snow” and “silver tributaries” extend the refraction motif cleanly. Paraphrase-loop screen clean; each sentence adds new sensory or causal inch. Minor scaffold: three adjectives in a row (“miniature oak”) but cadence earns it; closure beat is uncluttered, letting final stone-tuck land.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and pattern-linked—“repository of erased histories,” “sedimentary evidence.” No mixed metaphors or template cadence. Two minor paraphrase loops (“listened… collecting fragments of overheard stories” echoed later) and one filter-verb cluster (“she felt its texture in her memories”) keep it under 9.0, but artifacts never touch closure. High information ratio: every sentence layers container, body, or poison.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: longer clauses for contemplative listening, staccato fragments when she plucks strings. Metaphors are controlled—“crystallized like frost on glass”—and do not stack. One paraphrase loop: “gloomy cheerfulness” appears twice within four sentences; a minor loop but not at closure. Information density high; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry double duty: “tourists stumbled past, drunk on sugar and spectacle” advances crowd cover while encoding stakes. No paraphrase loops; each graffiti description adds new mechanical detail. One mixed metaphor streak—“a sprawling maze of platforms tethered together by rope and trust”—is forgiven because trust-as-cable becomes literal in closure vote. Line-level propulsion remains high through final mural glow.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, with high information density: each sentence advances tool, body, or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and accurate (“mist like a breathing thing”). Paraphrase loops are absent; no filter-verb clusters stall immediacy. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “she adjusted / she selected / she returned” triplet, but it lies outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality. Overall read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences vary in length and opening; no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. “Ice crystals falling from its wings onto the rust-stained windowsill” does triple sensory work in one stroke. Occasional elevated latinate words (“convergence,” “hydrology”) fit the cartographer POV and are balanced by concrete verbs (“scraped,” “exhaled”). No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet musical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“wind moved through vacant doorways like something searching” does dual duty for atmosphere and stakes. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences alternate with clipped percussive beats mirroring the tuner’s steps. One mixed metaphor (“secrets that rippled like heat above summer cobblestones”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero template cadence, no synonym loops; sentences vary length and opening. Information density high—“coral-encrusted pillars that rose like bones” does triple scene-work in ten words. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught early (“cathedral of stone and shadow”) and paid off in collapse image. Only a single simultaneity hiccup—“Energy coruscated… and for a heartbeat thought”—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short tremors (“The bodies would be found soon.”) to elongated coils that thread metaphor without clutter. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances the image (copper-stained walls → copper light → copperlight repose). Register stays inside rural-penitential idiom; no corporate drift. Opening and closing lines perform dual duty—anchor setting and re-cast stake.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between sinuous horticultural catalog and staccato ghost sightings, preventing monotony. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors stay internally consistent—glass cathedral, mercury tears, singing apples—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Opening and closing lines are image-based, avoiding explanatory lead-in or moral tail-off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, imagistic; each sentence layers sensory data or metaphor without scaffold. Only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“time had inverted… life and death one continuous weaving”) create minor loop; otherwise density is high. Figurative vehicles stay physically coherent. Final line cadence lands with punch.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes: long sensorial sentences at calm dawn, then clipped beats as courier approaches. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either setting, character, or stakes. Figurative language is sparse but grounded—“messages in bottles traversing an ocean” fits world logic. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line recharges earlier motif of vanishing marks.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid with varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“roots twisted like frozen thoughts”) and paid off in closure condensation image, so no −0.3. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density strong: one sentence often does scene + metaphor + interiority. Tiny scaffold: “the space where…” phrase repeats twice; barely grazes −0.1. Closure beat is crystalline and uncluttered, satisfying high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is densely figurative but patterned: fog as milk, light as fruit, orchard as photo—each metaphor services the central textural argument that permanence is unnecessary. No mixed metaphors collide in the climax; final beam fade is described in concrete verbs (“batteries dimmed”). One paraphrase loop—“light stealing the image rather than revealing it” restates the preceding photograph metaphor—deducts a hair. Scaffolding is otherwise tight; paragraphs advance knowledge or emotional charge. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the fog’s inhale/exhale without algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer sensory data without scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“each time she...each time the murals...each time she remembered”—appears mid-text; minor but noticeable. Metaphors stay coherent within sonic domain; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines ear-test strong. No typos, tense drift, or buried leads. Information often doubled (job + sensation) but advances mood.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence locates, characterizes, and stakes (“greenhouse smelled… breakfast thoughts… forty credits”). Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety: short pulse for tension, longer for exposition. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif. One paraphrase loop: “converging chaos… revolutions begin” is essentially restated, but serves as deliberate beat emphasis, not artifact. No scaffolding, no synonym churn. Clean copy: pronouns, tense, punctuation exact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythm-varied, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold: “longing—for rest, for peace, for the world” could be one phrase. Metaphors stay coherent—“seedlings push through concrete”—no mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers history, sensory detail, emotional stance. Closing line “she felt something close to rest” lands with cadential exhale, avoiding overwriting. A few adjectival boosts (“reef-shadow joy,” “velvet black”) verge on purple but pattern-earned by accumulative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths swell and contract with Miren’s attention. Figurative language is sparse and purposive—fractures of rose/amber, burning copper—never clustering into purple haze. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, object, and emotional tilt (“She held the broken tube to the light, watching opalescent shadows dance across her palm, and felt foxglove regret”). No synonym churn or template cadence; only a single paraphrase loop (“feelings that now existed only here...in this library above the world”) costs −0.2, capping Q7 at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm to track emotional respiration; figurative language is selective (“frozen tear” ink well) and paid off in the final “prism”; no loops or scaffold, and high information density—each clause advances knowledge or stakes—keeps momentum inside the 800-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty—description braided with action—and avoid synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadows dappled…”) fits atmospheric opening, then yields to sparser mechanics. No mixed metaphors, no filter stacks; closure sentence (“building breathed, steady and eternal”) lands with cadence earned, not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening structure; no template cadence or synonym churn. High information density: “tissue-thin messages… old-fashioned and the deliberately disconnected” layers social world, character stance, and thematic paper motif in one breath. Metaphors are consistent—dust motes as constellation, songs as ash—without mixed logic. No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. The final line “Now we see who comes back” is monosyllabic closure that stops the rhythm exactly where the stakes crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new physical or emotional information. Metaphors are coherent—grain as river, light as breath—and never clash. High-density line: “The table's grain swirled around a knot like water around a stone. She followed the pattern, let her mind drift into its whorls, and began to see.”—three jobs in one motion: setting, metaphor, epiphany. Opening and closing lines are architected: opener anchors the dream-physics; closer delivers the irreversible step. No scaffolding, no synonym churn, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: comma-rich cadence for shimmer, staccato beats for seed-drops. Metaphors stay within optic/sea register, no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacks (“soft rainbow light, beautiful and cold simultaneously”) risk purple but serve tonal paradox. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase; information dense. Final line seeds/sang/vanished triad delivers closure image with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—advance clock, reveal choice, paint sensorium. No mixed metaphors or strained vehicles; starlight/ivory echo is consistent. A few template cadences (“She began… She moved… She pocketed”) but they coincide with ritualized routine, reading intentional. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new micro-cue. Copy clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—tide, ink, starlight—and never clash. No loops or synonym churn; “gaps” recurs with reweighted meaning, taught early. A single filter verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she understood”) is acceptable under lyric pressure and does not dull the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for mist, staccato for stone strikes. Metaphors are coherent—water rings as “bell in a distant chapel”—and kept sparse so the final “illumination in his satchel” lands clean. No loops or scaffold; “stone...stone...stone” is purposeful anaphora, not churn. Information density is high: one sentence slips in lifetime craft, present tension, and metaphor (“forty years cutting...searching the panes for meanings”).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesurae in “trading skin for salvation, trading truth for peace” echo heartbeat cadence. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Metaphors stay coherent—moonlight as silver, grief as negative space—without mixed spillage. Minor density spike in “topography of trauma,” but it’s earned by prior burn description.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is selective—light as “overlapping realities,” gauge needle “dancing”—and never clogs the high-pressure beat. One mixed metaphor risk: “barriers between timelines… like waves meeting” is quickly grounded in “deep water,” so coherence holds. Opening and closing lines bookend with tidal motion, giving satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers setting, character tool, or metaphor; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphor check: “flora…like refugees” and “corridors sighed” coexist without contradiction. Opening and closing lines are crisp hooks/echoes. Minor nominalizations (“acoustics,” “consciousness”) unavoidable for concept but kept lean.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates—long anaphoric song lines vs. stark final sentence—propelling the bell-countdown. Figurative language is dense but purposeful; density decreases into the clean final line. No loops or synonym churn; “heartbeat” repeats only when it reweights meaning. One mixed vehicle (“time deposited into her chest”) barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: every sentence advances memory, ritual step, or relational pressure.  Figurative language is selective—moonlight “washing” the terrace, grief “carved” on wood—never clogging the ceremonial tempo.  No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each clause adds new information or tactile detail.  A single mixed metaphor (“brittle as old parchment” for voice) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences braid salt, geography, and moral ledger. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; “salt that crunched like old bones” is precise, not purple. Closing cadence—“beautiful and broken, a grace assembled from fragments”—earns its lyric lift via prior pattern of fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snow began to shimmer differently, reflecting not moonlight but something deeper, more prismatic” packs world-shift into one sentence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language peaks at sanctuary arrival yet stays coherent—“echoes hanging like fruit” is fresh and paid off by literal gathering. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for dawn arrival, short clause for guards’ recoil. No typos or tense slips. Opening and closing lines act as frame and hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; “meteor hush” and “peculiar quiet” risk lyric repetition but repay by charging closure. Information density is high—“half-remembered folktales,” “rust belt,” “mismatched furniture”—each doing world and character work. Rhythm accelerates into the drunk’s interruption, then breathes into the suspended ending. One mixed metaphor—“curved embrace of the old radar dome”—is minor; clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“orange wings against orange sky, carrying their ended future”). Metaphors are coherent—no mixed vehicles—and serve POV bias. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold in second paragraph (“She was an esoteric realist by trade and temperament…”) is strategic exposition, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence carries double duty—e.g., “The aurora pulsed brighter, as if watching” advances atmosphere while externalizing guilt. Metaphors are coherent and concrete: rope tension = phoneme length, ice ceiling = projection screen, bronze cooling = memory solidifying—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by auditory image that recharges earlier bell motif. High density achieved through verb choice (“shafted,” “spelled”) and noun specificity (“flax,” “diphthong”) without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—each sentence layers new detail on tile, history, resource scarcity—yet remains lucid. Metaphors are sparse and clean; no mixed vehicles. Rhythmic variation mirrors contemplative drift and the eventual dawn lift. Only hairline flaw: “reimagined Babylonian palace” phrase repeats twice within 90 words; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion: “walls breathed with translucent uncertainty” collapses description and action into one clause. One scaffold instance—“the careful manipulation, the scheming pacifist’s careful dance”—but decorative, not causal. Metaphor chain (pin/code/memory) stays coherent: all map to stored information whose playback can change. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences give way to staccato line “That was before—” mirroring the broken music.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; high density—every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language coherent: “suspended diamonds” → “glass mountains” → “frozen apples” form tight metaphor chain. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraphs cut cleanly. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “their roots threading through stone and timber” performs scenic and metaphoric work simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either peril of height or emotional stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent (apple blossoms as shed vows) without mixed logic. Final line cadence—“apples ripened in cathedral light”—resolves with hymnal resonance that feels earned, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dense lyricism risks purple overload yet stays tethered to concrete nouns (pistachio shell, pomegranate, fig). One paraphrase loop—“simply complicated” repeated four times—subtracts without breaking closure. Mixed-metaphor check clean: silver fruit blooming backward is internally consistent. Final third free of artifacts; earlier synonym churn (“luminous…brightened…glow”) remains within pattern taught.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “temporal prepositions—those strange verbal flowers” compresses botany and grammar in one image. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (mountain as symphony, diary as root system). One mixed vehicle: “harmonic shift—like a note in the wrong octave” is immediately anchored to physical sensation, so coherence holds. Final line spaces itself as coda, ear-tested for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable; figurative language is selective, never floods a single beat. Occasional elevated register (“negotiable, permeable, blissfully aberrant”) risks template cadence, yet the pattern is voice-motivated and consistent. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds texture or knowledge. Final line—“she was the discovered”—nails the cadence shift required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “reality seemed to hiccup” compresses world-shift without cliché. No filter-verb stacks, no loops; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—wax “pressed into red wax” avoids redundant noun. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “translate confusion into clarity” with earned irony now that clarity includes contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is high but pattern-taught (“crystal clarity,” “electric scream”) so it reads as deliberate texture rather than overwriting. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor register drift—“Conceptual Repricing,” “Resonant Reconfiguration”—appears only here in editorial commentary, not story text. Closure image (“sound of peace taking root in stone”) is clean, audible, and free of mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is loop-free, with high double-duty density: “thistle seeds blew against the glass…tiny parachutes of hope seeking purchase” fuses metaphor, weather, and theme in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; the crack’s geometry stays physically consistent with star triangulation. Register remains within Mera’s salvage-world lexicon—no latinate overreach. Final line “hope, like thistle seeds, required only the smallest crack” is a deliberate echo, not a template, because it re-crackles the repaired prism. Alliteration is sparse and purposeful, never clogging forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density high—“droplets still clung…magnifying the inscriptions beneath” does triple sensory, plot, metaphor duty. No paraphrase loops; metaphor stack (fog “rippled like muscle beneath skin”) is brief, vivid, paid off. Copy-editing clean; pronoun paths unambiguous. Final line’s syntactic inversion (“she simply stood and remembered remembering”) lands intended echo without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, high-density: “satchel heavy with copper filings and sulfur compounds” does world, occupation, and motive in one breath. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric chant vs. fragment—“Watch.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (bloom = fortress = people). Register drift absent. Minor over-writing in “serious playfulness” tag, but it does not scar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences layer image, motion, and world rule (“clouds drifted below her feet”). One paraphrase loop (“silence…silence”) early; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative language peaks at the bloom beat but stays coherent. Final line cleanly recharges “stretching contracted” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data without pad. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“hand catching snow,” “slow water”—never stacked. One tiny paraphrase loop “seven years… seven minutes” flagged; otherwise no scaffold or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene, accelerating slightly at whistle echo then settling.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, metaphors coherent (“compressed starlight and human ambition”). One mixed vehicle—“kaleidoscopic waterfall” jostles with “living color that sang”—is minor. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each advances knowledge or charge. Final line cadence mirrors sunrise swell. No scaffolding, no redundancy, no artifact touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong imagistic density (ash like silver, obscene glow), but metaphor strings in consecutive sentences create mild clutter; scaffold lines (“She thought she had found peace… Then Sienna arrived”) feel template-ish. Closural image avoids muddle, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Repetition is minimal; sentences vary in cadence, no template runs. Figurative language is selective (pressure/diamond motif) and coherent. Information density high: one line can set scene, mood, and world rule (“Lies now left sticky residue…”). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line re-illuminates motif. Two minor simultaneity slips (“She held… as she pressed…”) but actions remain sequential. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “amber light slanting…to paint everything in sepia tones” sets scene and moral tint in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—sound becomes canvas, dust becomes pigment—without purple overload. A single adverb (“precisely”) is expendable, yet momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong density and propulsion; occasional metaphor stacks (“terror and ecstasy braided like electricity through copper wire”) flirt with overwriting but stay pattern-taught. Minor scaffold: “possibility” and “pattern” echo, yet no loops obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or metaphor pile-ups. The single potential overwrite—“the comfortable tyranny of indifference”—is earned by prior world-building and doesn’t stall momentum. Clean mechanics; strong paragraph cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are sparse but precise: “fog against glass” sustains physical logic. High information density—each sentence advances setting, stake, or sonic mechanics. One mixed metaphor risk—“forgotten prayers” beside “vested hush”—but the religious register is earned by monk history. Zero scaffold; no filler verbs clog the high-pressure grotto beats. Final line is clipped, giving rhythmic closure that echoes the saxophone’s cut-off note.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or image. Figurative vehicles stay coherent: leaves → moths → rain → questions maintains one fluid transformation logic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line (“shimmering with every color transformation could hold”) resolves by recharging the ash palette. No scaffold or register drift; high information density without overcrowding the 750-word count.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety avoids template cadence. One scaffold trace: “leaves—ochre, copper, rust—carpeted” repeats chromatic triad elsewhere; momentarily decorative but does not stall propulsion. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density—each sentence advances place, tool, or interior stance. Final line is crisp, image-driven, no paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors forge pulse: longer anaphoric coils for guilt, staccato beats when gold hits coin. No template cadence or synonym loops; “golden lines,” “golden ash,” “golden mark” recur with escalating meaning, taught pattern. Mixed metaphor check clean: “luminous regret—bright and aching as dawn” holds. Closure line “washing everything clean while leaving the essential scars untouched” is crisp, propulsive, irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density lines: “confessions repeated endlessly, trapped in the canyon’s acoustic peculiarities” does world, conflict, and theme in one stroke. Figurative language is selective—twilight suspended like ink, laughter like water over stones—never clogs urgency. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; paragraph cut-test passes. Minor alliteration drift (“luminous ache… laughter… broken”) but pattern is taught early and pays off in final cadence, so reads as control, not affectation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from fragment-breaths to longer clauses that mimic data overload. No paraphrase loops; each line adds sensory or emotional news. Figurative control is tight: “precision instrument” is earned, not borrowed. Only minor scaffold—“She forced it into a fist” could lose “it”—but propulsion never stalls, and closure image remains luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and propel; no loops or synonym churn. A few abstract qualifiers (“elusively tangible,” “crystallized feeling”) recur close together and slightly dilute sensory immediacy, but they never obscure causality or stall the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose breathes with scene needs: slow dust sentences vs. staccato tile removal. Density high—“horologist’s mainspring barrel, impossibly intricate, wedged…” does triple duty. One template cadence spotted (“Marcus nodded…Marcus asked…Marcus documented”) but short and early; closure beat is clean. Metaphors stay physical and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm solid.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled—sentence length and verb intensity rise as the orchard mutates. Occasional poetic overlay (“alphabetically inside-out”) risks Purple but stays brief and pattern-consistent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; information density is high. Two filter-verb clusters (“that emerged wasn’t heard so much as felt”) slightly dull the uncorking beat, blocking 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences double-duty: “cascading auroras of past and future” fuses visual spectacle with temporal mechanics. No paraphrase loops; each velvet drape or gilt flake appears once, charged. Metaphors stay mutually lucid—mirrors as traps, storms as visible history—no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the shard motif with zero scaffold. Minor filter-verb trio (“he could see them”) is voice-motivated hallucination, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm swings from cathedral cadence to tight pin-click without monotony; sentence openings vary. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (resonance chamber as violin) and pays off in closure choir—no penalty. Zero loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “covenant of rust” repeated thrice; because it accrues liturgical force, no deduction. Information density strong—each line advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence delivers GPS loss, coastal road erasure, and motive. Sentence openings vary; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors are consistent (arch as scaffold, storm as collaborator). Minor scaffold: “turbine-hum” repeated four times; not severe enough to touch closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beat. Clean grammar and pronoun reference; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long-hyphenated sentences for slanting light, clipped fragments for night work. Information density high—each sentence layers pigment, season, and emotional tilt. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase risk—“honeyed pools” echoed by “honey-light”—but spaced enough to read as motif return, not loop. Prose propels to final image without overwriting. Meets 9+ quick test save for single near-repeat; capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent (glass, teeth, cracks) and serve pressure. One near-scaffold: “memory seized her like a fist” is familiar phrasing but is immediately followed by specific sensory takeover, so artifact does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The amber bottle had appeared…nested in the tide pools where the paper lanterns once reflected like fallen stars” fuses backstory, setting, and loss in one breath. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and targeted; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. A single paraphrase twitch—“she had not stayed to preserve a corpse” followed immediately by “she had not revived a ghost town”—is minor enough to leave the 9-band untouched and closure unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; opening clause “The foghorn had sounded…” immediately establishes cadence. Figurative language is restrained—single metaphor “silence like a weight” that is never over-milked. No loops or synonym churn; every detail either advances atmosphere or seeds the closure. High information density: one sentence slips 3 facts (1889, harbor, transplantation) without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet lucid: “fractals of light spread across the frozen fountain” does three jobs—visual, causal, metaphoric. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; each paragraph advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are sparse and apt—“vast antenna tuned to the atmosphere”—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo without ornamental filler.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“sweeping stardust”), no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective—meteor as “sentence,” glass bubbles as “stars suspended in honey”—and never floods a single beat. One microscopic scaffold: “ancient songs to the rising sun” could compress, but it does not dull the closure image. Clean copy, precise punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyric—"honey darker than midnight" compresses color, taste, and lore into five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances pattern or adds sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “She tucked it into her notebook between pages of half-written verses” advances action, objects, theme. Metaphors stay coherent (lagoon swallows sky, feather still holds shimmer). No paraphrase loops; sentence openings varied. Minor register lift (“burnished hush”) justified by Maya’s poet ear. Final line cadence mirrors an unclosed weave, propelling rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density, no paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or concept. Metaphors are spare and precise—“rainwashed and gleaming,” “bronze quiet”—never clogging the narrow word count. Opening line hooks voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (formula remains) that recharges tower/amber motifs. Minor rhythmic repetition of “she could feel” twice in final third, but it occurs outside the closure beat and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful—each sentence advances gardening action or avian intel. One paraphrase loop (“where soil had settled… where fresh water seeped…”) mildly dulls mid-section; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clean: no filter-verb stacks, mixed metaphors, or template cadence. Opening sentence anchors voice and concept in one sweep. Occasional near-loop: “trying to forget what her gifts had shown her” is paraphrased two sentences later as “what others miss”—minor but perceptible. High-info density achieved through noun-plus-verb pairings (“wind whistling,” “veins emerged”). No artifact touches closure beat, keeping 8+ territory intact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences pull double duty (e.g., “galaxies aged and died in accelerated ballet” delivers image + stakes). Only micro-loop: “She sketched… She drew…” pair restates without new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent (compass as time-anchor, rose as gilded supernova mirror). No artifacts near closure; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (“She crushed it, felt it dissolve, and placed her mentor’s queen…” advances plot + bodies emotion). Mixed-metaphor risk is skirted: “sky had turned the color of old bruises” is single vehicle, sustained. Only minor loop: “secrets she couldn’t quite hear” is echoed by “wind screamed secrets” but the repetition is purposeful, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “nomadic penumbra” carries triple duty—light, displacement, mood—without purple drift. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (electricity through water) and physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero boilerplate; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm accelerates through enjambed clauses during memory rush, then slows to final declarative. Figurative language stays accurate: feather barbs “catching on carved grooves” is tactile and precise.

No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “frozen” and “thread” recur with evolving meaning, not repetition artifact. Metaphors stay coherent (amber silence, platinum labyrinth) and do not obscure causality. One near-template—“her fingers already fidgeting productively”—is isolated; otherwise diction is specific, verbs strong, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with discovery: long sentences for cave description, staccato “She stayed. She memorized.” under peak cold.

Metaphors stay physically coherent; final line is clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: one sentence can do three jobs—“The scent spiraled upward, caught by the dawn breeze, and Mara felt something shift in her ribcage” moves prop, setting, interior change. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (scent as voice, beacon as visibility). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Occasional elevated phrasing (“screaming tenderness”) is earned by interior logic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical: “thin as a fingernail scraping the sky” is precise, not purple. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. One micro-tautology—“the work of return”—is earned by final placement and prior accumulation. Clause variety and strong verbs keep momentum across reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multitask: “Wrapped in oilcloth beneath an oak’s exposed roots: an antique glass eye, pale blue with gold flecks that seemed to swim in the light” delivers prop, texture, and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphors stay physically coherent—gold flecks swim, not “shattered galaxies.” Opening and closing lines are propulsive: first anchors vocation and peril, last recharges “storm-scarred and surviving” with newfound agency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; metaphors (“museum of grief”) are spare and earned. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines serve as resonant brackets.

    <question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Edelweiss-as-storage device is fresh yet intuitively right, marrying alpine sentiment to silica lattice. The “gaps” investigation method and nautical-twilight isolation angle a familiar grief plot into surprising terrain. Risk is moderate but successful; transformation test passes—swap flower and setting and the emotional math collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “The world below vanished into white nothingness” compresses altitude and psychology. Metaphors stay internally consistent—starlight as blood, grotto as wound—without mixed-vehicle collision. One paraphrase loop: “color of deep ocean, the color of midnight, the color of bruises” could lose one clause. Otherwise rhythm breathes with ascent, and zero scaffolding obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often couples sensory detail with conceptual weight—“ember nexus pulsed…fed by their combined presence.” No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (light as breath, spiral as path).

Metaphor vehicles stay coherent within sound/light orchard logic; closure image remains clear without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “footsteps became philosophical statements” fuses action and metaphysics.

Rhythm accelerates naturally once Marcus is discovered, mirroring Mira’s tactical pivot. Final line lands with percussive brevity that re-illuminates the title image. Only a single near-cliché (“quiet between them felt like wildfire”) grazes purple, but it is earned by prior pattern and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “watercolor abstraction,” “psychological cartography,” “compressed symbolic language” all twin image with idea. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors are coherent (rain as percussion, notebooks as prison graffiti) and do not overpopulate high-pressure beats. Clause rhythm modulates: cumulative anaphora in notebook list, then clipped final line. Copy is clean; only nit is minor over-modification “clean-washed air,” but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: short declaratives for call openings, longer cadences for reflection. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“tunnel seemed to breathe”—no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence toggles map, storm, motive. Figurative control precise—“pathways blooming and collapsing like origami” mirrors digital fold without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Strong verbs dominate: “adjusted,” “gripped,” “slipped away.” Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths mirror beat pauses. Proofing clean. One near-miss: “calculated spontaneity” as adjective pile, but phrase is motivated by POV’s professional gaze and is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)

    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, each sentence advances image or stakes. Density is high—“she herself was more ancient than most of the texts”—yet clarity never wavers. The only hairline slip: “across the pause of shifting constellations” is briefly ornate amid otherwise spare temporal cues, but the phrase is earned by star-chart payoff. Closure line is unmarred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors tidal ebb: clusters of short percussive clauses, then longer reflective cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and musical—almost every sentence layers image + motion + metaphor—yet remains clear. One scaffold loop: “fragmentation was truth… fragmentation the only honest way” restates identical claim within four lines; minor. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph cadence earns its slow sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. High information density: “Ink. / But not ordinary ink.”—two jobs in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse,Pattern of prismatic flashes / wind-carved pillars” stays physically accurate. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of patient erosion with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere); momentum breathes well. But “dizzying quiet” recurs four times, sliding toward mantra; “echoing library” appears thrice without fresh angle. Metaphor stack in one clause (“glacial tombs,” “crystallized data cores,” “frozen conscience”) risks purple bruise. These loops don’t obscure causality but dull the final third’s freshness, capping ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentence delivers origin, history, and ethic function of canvas. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (dome as “amber sanctuary” holds). Filter verbs serve lyric compression, not hedging. Final line “roses leaned toward them both, learning” is textured, not ornamental, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “echoes zigzag through impossible angles, fleeing into dimensions where conventional nets cannot follow” does three jobs—world, stakes, and obstacle—in one line. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold. Register stays inside Mira’s plausible diction; “transliterate” is the lone technical term and is justified by the garden’s acoustic physics. Final line “She was too busy listening to her daughter sing” lands with cadence that resolves the opening silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet read-aloud musical; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. Metaphors (amber holds light like promise) stay coherent under internal logic. Information carries double duty—e.g., “ink the color of nebulae” shows both vocation and cosmos-obsessed worldview. Minor purple tint in “susurration of a thousand intimate moments” but justified by accrual texture, does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances either sand pattern, acoustic texture, or emotional stake. Figurative control: “mist finding a new shape” is precise—mist literally reshapes visibility. High-density line: “the mess wasn’t meant to be cleaned up or solved. The mess was the message” compresses thesis into two monosyllabic beats without moralizing. Final line “meaning began its slow, strange rebirth” avoids adjective excess; strangeness is already justified by prior acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—two extended metaphors (sky as cracked glass, guilt as tessera) that pay off at closure. Opening and final lines act as symmetrical brackets anchoring voice and stakes. Micro-rhythm breathes with escalation: clipped fragments during retrocognitive flashes, expansive syntax during ethical reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length modulates from urgent anaphora (“She sang…”) to lingering orchard sentence. High density: single sentence often advances plot, image, theme (“apple trees heavy with silver fruit twisted toward a perpetually twilit sky”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line packs punch without over-flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm clean; sentences vary; no template cadence. High info density: static jolt condenses into 3-second phenomenology plus forward engine (“What if electricity…”). Metaphors (time-lapse flowers, river deltas) are disciplined—one per beat, never stacked. Pronoun rock-solid across two women. Minor scaffolding: “not for the first time” could delete; doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—tide-breathing, amber hope—never overwrought. Information density high: single sentences layer time-depth, scientific tool, and emotional register. Minor scaffold: repeated “she would” in closing paragraph creates a soft litany; barely dulls momentum. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored, ear-tested when read aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “March mist rolled up from the valley like whispered secrets” packs time, place, mood. Rhythm varies—paratactic snow descriptions mimic drift layering; short verbless line “Tomorrow” provides decisive exhale. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay wind/snow domain-coherent. Minor near-repeat—“silver hush” used twice—earns leitmotif status, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension; sentence variety is deliberate, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective (“fog thick as wool”, “morse code”) and physically coherent—no mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence often layers weather, emblem, and emotional cue. Minor filter verbs appear (“seemed to percolate”) but are voice-motivated and paid off. No loops, scaffolds, or near-duplicates. Copy clean except one hyphenation slip. Prose propels rather than decorates, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric compression avoids loops; figurative language is sparse and pattern-taught (“kiln of entropy,” “copper light”). Sentence variety supports breathing space; no mixed metaphors. High information density—each sentence layers time or care. Final paragraph achieves quiet crescendo without prose clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, loop-free; no scaffolding or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—light as lock-pick, oar-stroke as persistence—avoiding purple overload. One mixed image: “quivering hush” is abstract, but the clause is brief and functional, not clarity-breaking. Filter verbs are minimal; most perception is embodied (“brass tooth pressed warm”). Rhythm modulates: short beat openings accelerate the midnight descent, longer clauses slow the lighthouse tableau. Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors, paragraph cuts tight.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and imagistic—“clouds roll like white oceans beneath atomically reflective floors”—yet avoids purple overload by anchoring every metaphor to Kael’s navigation task. Minor loop: “brittle awakenings” is repeated twice in close proximity; otherwise rhythm varies, sentences do plural jobs, and no mixed metaphors obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“storm pulled them from everywhere. Walls, forgotten drawers, the mud beneath old houses” packs world-building into one sentence. Metaphors stay internally coherent (nest ↔ longing architecture). Rhythm accelerates during the tying sequence, then breathes at the golden pond. No artifact touches the closure beat; the final line’s “crystalline notes” is earned, not tacked.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with action: long sentences for theory, staccato for sensory assault. No paraphrase loops; “signals” is repeated but each iteration gains new data (random → conversational → weaponized). Metaphors stay consistent—celestial navigation language extended into electronic warfare. Opening and closing lines are crisp, the latter recharging “dawn” with new cognitive freedom. Minor scaffolding: “might wreck the station—or worse” could lose “or worse,” but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: “compass point trembling in her grip” does double duty—object state + emotional leak. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors disciplined: starlight as silver rain taught early, paid off in final line. One mixed moment—“wistful rebellion coursed through her veins” skirts label-speak but is rescued by immediate embodied action (kneeling, pressing stone).

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or insight. Figurative layering is disciplined—metaphors of topology, grammar, architecture stay coherent. One paraphrase loop: “unified opposites” appears twice in adjacent sentences; minor. No scaffold; opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-pressure revelation beat is lean. No mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Minor filter verbs (“She explained,” “he whispered”) don’t stall momentum. Opening line anchors stakes and place; final line offers resonant cadence without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). One paraphrase loop: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” appears twice with no added charge—minor loop. Metaphors stay coherent (glass flake = frozen raindrop), no mixed vehicles. Clean tense control; information front-loaded efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Varied sentence rhythm; high density—one line slips “he’d convinced himself that his company’s aggressive expansion was innovation, not predation” compressing backstory and moral dodge. Zero loops or mixed metaphor; “polished calm” repeat is the only micro-redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose breathes with scene tempo: long clauses for slow tracking, clipped fragments at telescope epiphany. Metaphors stay consistent—stars as language, light as breath—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold spotted: “shared burdens” is repeated in narration and then quoted by Kove; trimming the second would sharpen. Otherwise high density, zero paraphrase loops, strong verbs anchor every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence = staff planted, season, vortex behavior, Kael’s reputation. Metaphors stay coherent—“malevolent heart” parallels later pulse in bark. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“planted,” “churning,” “swirling”). One paraphrase loop: “confession never finished / confession never complete” costs −0.2. Final image clear, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “cobalt glade shimmered with an impossible luminescence” packs sight, color, and emotional charge in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are coherent—shadow-fingers, crystallized possibility—and culminate in the final maze without muddle. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical cadence for awe, staccato for scar-jolt.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied: sentence openings rotate among prepositional, participial, and direct subject without algorithmic feel. Information density is high—one line can set atmosphere, advance plot, and foreshadow (“roots threading through ribcages like curious fingers”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (lantern/amber/shadows) and do not violate orchard physics. Copy-clean: no homophones, pronoun confusion, or tense drift. Final line supplies a resonant cadence that reprises “unmake” as closure drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is sparse and precise (“sound traveled strange”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges echo motif. One near-redundant clause—“trying to wrest meaning from fibers and facts”—is trimmed by context, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is dense—mixed metaphors (“roots in clay, branches in starlight”) yet internally coherent. One scaffold: “She was nothing if not patient” is a cliché stem. Information density good—each paragraph advances botany or grief linkage. Closure line is clean; no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between short percussion beats and tidal long sentences; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (“shelves that migrated like schools of fish”) so it pays off rather than muddles. Zero filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: single sentences fuse setting, object, and emotional charge—“caught the cave’s latent radiance.” No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it aligns with Commission voice. Final image syntax is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained—"ivy cascading like green waterfalls frozen in time" is the single extended metaphor and it’s apt. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. Minor register lift in "conceptual repricing" meta phrasing, but it compresses rather than distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lean yet textured: every sentence either advances motion or re-weights object stakes. No filler prepositional strings; rhythm modulates from short pulse beats to long syrup clauses as time thickens. Metaphors are spare and congruent—library “breathes,” shelves “whisper”—never stacking into purple. Zero paraphrase loops; even abstract nouns (“recursive reading,” “conceptual silence”) carry acquired tactile dread.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet lush: every sentence advances image, causality, or interiority. No loops or mixed metaphors; “velvet observatory,” “porcelain continents” are precise. Rhythm breathes with tension—no algorithmic cadence. Final line lands with crystalline economy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short pulse (“Time contracted.”) to long, aurora-lit clauses without algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “static...like constellations” is the only metaphor, taught early and paid off. Zero scaffolding, synonym loops, or filter verbs. The final line’s cadence—“lucidly watchful. Always listening for the patterns.”—achieves Charged Poise without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is rhythmic, loop-free; figurative language is patterned—grotto as cathedral, cycle as wheel—so density feels deliberate. No mixed metaphors; “scalloped away the excess barnacles” is crisp. One paraphrase loop spotted: “ darkness and light embraced, where ending and beginning were the same threshold” restates prior duality—minor −0.1. High information ratio; every sentence layers image or motive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density high—one line often layers setting, tool, and emotional cue. Figurative control tight: “cloak of doubt” appears once, no mixed-metaphor pile-ups. Minor paraphrase loop on “wind says you’ve been lying” / “listen to what you already know” (−0.2); not in closure beat, so 9+ still open.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet limpid—each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept without scaffolding: “the rings seemed to pulse with their own rhythm... dark crescents that appeared and vanished.” No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; figurative language is restrained to two metaphors per beat, avoiding purple drift. Filter verbs are almost absent; perception is direct. Opening and closing lines are sharp, book-ending the lesson in image. Minor cadence echo (“appeared and vanished, appeared and vanished”) is pattern-taught and payoff-visible, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm mimics canyon reverb: periodic enjambed clauses that fold back on themselves. Information density high—“coating itself in the dust of countless seasons” compresses time and material change in one verb phrase. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay sonic or mineral. One paraphrase loop mid-story echoes the pulse’s circularity and is pattern-taught, hence waived. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “wedge-shaped stone carved with vines and laughing faces” does world, backstory, and emotional cargo in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Figurative control peaks in “cathedral of rust and barnacles,” exact and fresh. Only a single adjective stack (“slow-burning stars”) risks purple, but context justifies. Copy is clean; pronoun antecedents track through underwater choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (photographs in reverse, newborn colts) are apt and varied. One mixed micro-image: “static bursts came faster now, each one carrying fragments” could imply speed of sound; tightening to “arrived closer” avoids physics hiccup. Otherwise line-level control is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory atlas, historical wax cylinders, emotional stakes. Metaphors are controlled—kraken=grief—anchored in POV’s cartographic mindset; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breath before naming, staccato during crystallization. Only microscopic scaffold: “again and again until the words became a kind of prayer” could compress, but it occurs mid-scene, not in closure beat, so artifact does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; sentences advance on multiple tracks (“Layer by layer, drip by drip, she reformed the clapper, each addition timed to the rate at which water wanted to fall”). Figurative language is disciplined—only two metaphors, both water/bell, never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes Earned Stasis with image, not explanation. No overwriting even in peak beat; momentum breathes with paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances atmosphere while embedding causality (“dropped forty feet… town resurfacing”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (water as erasure, chime as memory). Opening line anchors stakes and sensory hook; final line resolves via image. Minor scaffold: “the photographs led her” repeats thrice but serves trail motif, so forgiven. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)

High density; every paragraph advances premise or image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long hypotonic clauses mirror fog, then staccato verbs (“She stood… walked”) mark stance shift. Information density high—“petals suspended in ice like thoughts” does sensory + thematic double duty. One mixed-metor borderline: “boundary where light decided whether to illuminate or withdraw” anthropomorphizes light but fits taught rule. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closing sentence “She pulled the first frozen book…” propels outward.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses image, backstory, and causality—“Each failure had been creative destruction, burning away ignorance.” No loops or paraphrase stacks; metaphors stay consistent (ember = blood, spiral = neuron). Opening line anchors voice and stakes in 19 words. Final line—“the dangerous luxury of hope”—re-energizes “hope calcified into habit” from paragraph 2, fulfilling pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“fragment…still held traces of celestial iron, making it perfect…”). Occasional soft abstract noun stacks (“the architecture of spacetime itself”) slightly dilute peak beats, but metaphor logic stays consistent. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence repetition (“Every ending promised…”) reads intentional, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and propulsive: “The ferry shuddered. Mrs. Chen materialized…” uses sentence fragmentation to accelerate reintegration. Metaphors stay sensory and coherent—“outline shimmering like heat waves.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information dual-loads (action + atmosphere) without scaffolding. Final line cadence repeats “waiting…call it home,” a deliberate echo that recharges the opening ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentences carry double duty (density + atmosphere); occasional elevated register (“ineffable quality”) fits art-world POV; one scaffold echo—“thread began to sing / sang louder”—minor, doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: every sentence layers metaphor, exposition, or emotional charge (“corroded boat anchor chain link in her palm, feeling its weight like a question”). Varied sentence openings; only one scaffold loop (“navigate… navigation” echo) but it serves thematic drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb clusters. Final line achieves read-aloud cadence without monotony. Minor synonym adjacency (“darkness… dark”) does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and sensory-dense: “device trembled with a rhythm” does double duty (object + emotion). No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty: “water dripped from the ceiling in a rhythm like failing breath” marries sound to mortal stakes. Metaphor density peaks at two per paragraph but pattern is taught early and maintained, avoiding overwrite. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensor or causal bit. Minor scaffold: “phase transitions” repeated thrice with identical noun phrase—could vary syntax. Closure sentence clean, no mixed metaphor, strong verb “spoke again.”

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and precise: “echoes gathered and nested” is fresh yet physical. High information density—each sentence layers process + emotional import. Zero paraphrase loops; no simultaneity errors. Opening and closing lines serve as acoustic brackets, a nice micro-echo device. One mixed metaphor—“language swallowed like a flood”—safe because it’s character thought, but it slightly jars against arid canyon imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: “moisture beading on limestone walls” does triple scene-setting work. No scaffold loops; metaphors are consistent (gravity, sound, light). Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines function as sonic bookends—descent vs. ascent—without overwriting. Minor intensifier “strange” could be cut, but it does not blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythmic variation mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of participles at the up-rooting, then clipped sentences for the exit. One mixed metaphor: “wood flowed like water through their grip” beside “granite heads grinding like millstones” momentarily pits liquid against stone, but context keeps it readable. No line-level artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “whisper-engines,” “disputed territory’s only mailman,” each noun carries world data.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long mist-laden clauses to clipped tool-verbs; no template cadence detected. Figurative control high—“mist threading between cattails,” “sound like water remembering music”—and never mixed. One scaffold spot: “she cleaned each horse, repaired the broken drive chain, oiled the ancient gears” could compress, but it falls outside the closure beat, so artifact does not touch final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; information density high—each sentence layers metaphor and physics. Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-purple stretch (“photons and paper”) but serves voice. No artifacts in final third; closure image is crisp. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized then that”) forgiven at lower pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “scaffolding on which notes might climb” does double duty as metaphor and literal sound construction. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tilt or starlight.

Final line “bearing witness to small resurrections” resolves by image, not assertion, with crisp rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—“moonlight like scattered pearls across dark water” packs image and mood in one stroke. No synonym loops; each fungal/celestial reference adds new structural data. Rhythm breathes: short sentences for ring-press shock, longer cadence for memory tide. Only hairline slip: “documenting everything” briefly abstracts an action that could be micro-scene’d.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tension: longer sentences during tea annotations, clipped fragments at “Sit.” No metaphor clutter; single sustained amber image carries across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative layers (“interlaced hush,” “unfallen snow”) are sparse and tied to pressure, avoiding purple drift. Information density high: one line can advance action, reveal texture, and foreshadow cost (“each knot held a voice, a memory, a death”). Minor scaffold: “She understood then” could be cut, but it occupies low-stakes beat; closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers map, fresco, and geological data without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: moisture-ghosted saints → cartographic absence → silence as interpretable space. No mixed vehicles or purple overload. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she suspected,” “she realized”) and paid off in final epistemic shift. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no template cadence. Final sentence earns its abstract leap because concrete images have been iteratively soldered.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm flexes from long clause-catalog of findings to clipped clauses at ascent (“She shook it gently”). Metaphors are sparse, precise, tested against physical logic: cigarettes for cylinders, cathedral ghost for library—each serves discovery mood, never stacks. No synonym loops, no template cadence, no mixed metaphor. Information density high; one sentence often does two jobs (“Marina maneuvered…the mechanical arm with quietly analytic precision, collecting cylinders methodically, scanning each seal…”). Copy is clean; only nit is an extra comma after “4:47 AM” but clarity unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph cuts land on image turns. Information density high: one sentence can world-build, advance action, and embody emotion (“She pressed the final bolt plate into place, completing the circuit.”). No synonym churn or template cadence. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is POV-consistent. Clean grammar, zero scaffolding; final line resolves on sonic image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: one sentence often performs description, interior shift, and micro-action (“Maren removed the goggles slowly, holding them like they held the captain’s soul”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; metaphors stay consistent (light, paint, spilled). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line offers charged poise without exposition. Minor elevation into poetic register (“God had spilled his paint”) fits the character’s folk idiom and remains singular, not purple. Proofreading is clean; pronoun and prop state track perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “clouds scroll like pages of an unfinished letter” compresses time, grief, and motion. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either data or emotion. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph’s cadence slows into iambs, letting “emptiness hummed with proof” resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—“cambium and heartwood” does arboreal world-building in three words. Metaphors are coherent: asymptotic curves, sap-weeping shelves, coin as meditation in metal—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“spiraled,” “pressed,” “tucked”). Paragraph cut test passes: every paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges asymptote motif. No typos or tense drift. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong opening cadence, varied sentence shapes, high information density. One paraphrase loop: “suspended here…no lift, no movement, no escape” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t stall climax. No mixed metaphors; brass/amber/chalk feel coherent. Closure line is crisp, propulsive. Minor scaffold in chicory exposition (“bitter chicory, but warm”) yet it adds character color.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: spondaic “ice-encased shelves gleamed” vs. trailing participial “casting everything in pale amber.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed metaphors zero; “visual symphony” stays within mirror/gear sound logic. Information density high: one sentence can set spatial relation, temperature, and emotional tilt. Closure line “rhythm of repair… as driftwood washed to unfamiliar shores” is crisp, non-generic.

Figurative language is sparse and apt—starlight “borrowed,” melody “braided.” Opening line anchors voice and metaphor simultaneously. Final paragraph repeats “bridges from silos” phrasing already stated, a minor scaffold, but it does not touch the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “silver light in chaotically precise patterns” does triple sensory/conceptual work. Metaphors stay coherent—skull canyon, double helix loops—without mixed vehicles.

Grammar clean; pronoun reference unambiguous. Final line resolves by image without expositional tag.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and targeted—“like distant thunder,” “wind through branches”—never clogging the peak nausea beat. Information density high: one sentence often layers scent, bodily reaction, and spiritual note.

One paraphrase loop—“documenting everything with hazy precision” appears twice with identical wording—dings rhythm. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic echo, tightening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long aurora drapes to clipped bell strikes. Metaphors stay coherent—“silence rang loudest…as pure white”—and serve synesthesia rather than ornament overload.

No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physically coherent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating urgency; paragraph lengths narrow as fragments tighten, propelling to the luminous last line.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, metaphor, and emotional tilt in single strokes (“fold their lives into neat squares”).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong kinetic verbs and sparse adjectives keep density high while sustaining lyric pulse; information often doubles (e.g., “swollen with seawater and secrets”). Metaphors stay internally coherent—no mixed aquatic/arboreal clashes. Occasional simultaneity hiccup: “She rolled the hangman’s dice one final time, watching how they fell—a sequence she’d orchestrated...” implies dice-throw and retrospective orchestration occur together; a micro-fix (“and saw”) would clarify. Artifacts never tangle the closure beat, so high-band remains valid.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only “gleaming silence” is repeated for resonance, not churn.

No mixed metaphors; “ghostly resolve” sustains tonal coherence without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “glacier shrine each night, carrying the weight of other people’s sleep” does triple duty—ritual frequency, vocational calling, metaphoric burden. No loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized testament”) drifts half a register above Maya’s likely lexicon, a hairline slip that nicks immediacy at the climax. Otherwise, cadence breathes with candle-flick tempo, and metaphors stay physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“hidden effort” twice in four lines) but it serves motif reinforcement, not padding.

    High density: copper coils, vacuum tubes, fragmented frequencies advance atmosphere and world in single phrases. Figurative language is patterned (lightning, shadow, dawn) rather than ornamental overload; no mixed metaphors. Scaffolding minimal; only “she transmitted one morning” could lose “one” but rhythm justifies. Read-aloud cadence peaks in final storm line, then cuts to silence—syntax mirrors content. Proofing clean; no typos or paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—short percussive clauses during jar-opening, longer sinuous sentences for waltz-blend.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: short beats for photo clicks, longer clauses for evidence accrual. No synonym loops; “water” returns only when state changes (drought → flood). Mixed metaphor check clean: “symphony of persistence” extends acoustic motif without clashing physics. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt… she saw… she tasted…”) is anchored inside inherited-flash device and pattern-taught early, so waived from artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong information density: “bell whispered rather than chimed” does two jobs. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. One paraphrase loop: “vibrant hush” repeated near-identically in open and close; minor. Metaphors (light through storm clouds) coherent and singular. Clean copy; no scaffold obscures closure.

Figurative language peaks at mirror-glimpses but pattern-taught early, paid off at closure. Strong verbs (“unfurl,” “groaned,” “fracturing”) replace modifiers. Paragraph cuts pass—each advances knowledge or emotional charge. Opening line anchors stakes; final line recharges “reconstitute” motif. One typo-risk: “impossible fruit that thrived” could tighten to “thrives” for present-tense consistency, but reads as intentional historical present.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors melt-and-refreeze cadence: long clauses crack into fragments at moments of loosened grip. Information density is high—one line can do weather, body, and metaphor without padding. Zero filter-verb clusters; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long spliced sentences to fragment staccato at closure. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, world rule, and character trait. No paraphrase loops; “shadow” recurs with reweighted meaning, not synonym churn. Metaphors are internally consistent (stars whisper, midnight presses like dark water). One minor scaffold: “She sat cross-legged… and began methodically working” could lose “methodically” without loss.

    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often layers job, sensation, and metaphor (“Her skepticism cracking open like an egg”). No scaffold or synonym loops; paraphrase absent. Metaphors stay coherent—bones, gates, maps, healing—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for clinical check. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers image-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image, tactility, or decision. Sentence variety is purposeful—participle openers mimic circular motion of polishing, then shift to blunt subject-verb for placement beats.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers job—image, motion, temperature, memory—without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (starlight as solder in copper channels) and rarely stack. Rhythm breathes: long anaphora in setup, staccato spark at burn. One mixed metaphor—“time stops… world holding breath”—is forgiven because it literalizes within story rules. No loops or paraphrase, clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory data, tool action, and concept (“she clapped once… seven different angles”). Zero paraphrase loops, no metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or knowledge without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and taught early—fractal, shingle, whalebone—so later saturation feels earned rather than overwritten.

    Zero loops; high density—“crystallized time,” “subtractive release,” “here and gone” all double as image and concept; figurative layers stay coherent (wood grain = time, laugh = curve); final line lands clean without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm alternates between long spirals and staccato clicks; no template cadence. Figurative layer selective—“carousel of opportunities” appears once and recurs as literal stopped ride. High density: one sentence often conveys elapsed decades and sensory bite. Line 3 mixed metaphor (weight of hours vs. decades) is hairline but closure unaffected. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences pivot on semicolons to mimic flow redirection. High information density—“dust motes danced in shafts of light piercing the broken skylights” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s repetition of “vast” is purposeful, not algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary; occasional soft scaffold (“excruciatingly gentle” repeated thrice) but never obscures causality; no mixed metaphors; high information density in violin-unwrapping beat; prop tracking clean—bow, velvet, crystals stay spatially coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong verbs (“crackled,” “dissolving”) and concrete nouns (“gnomon,” “charts”) keep density high. One scaffold loop: “architecture of lies” is repeated twice in close proximity; second use could compress. Mixed metaphor risk—“serene upheaval”—is justified by tonal payoff. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean, high-density prose; mixed-length sentences avoid cadence loops; metaphors (glass remembers) stay consistent and coherent. One scaffold trace: “patient wisdom” phrase repeated 3× but each use gains new semantic weight, so loop is mild. No overwriting; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid garden sentences to staccato dialogue beats. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple density. One mixed metaphor—“valleys that might collect something other than grief”—barely grazes clarity, forgiven by immediate tactile recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries high density: one sentence often paints sound, smell, and symbolic tilt (“steam-driven fountains produced water on precise schedules. Everything worked… nothing sang”). No filter-verb clusters, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“quaking reverie”) risks register drift but is earned by fairy-tale frame and pays off in closure cadence. Minor paraphrase loop near “he wept… tears falling onto coat” costs −0.2, not enough to touch ending.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the lagoon’s swell: long sentences mirror cloud migration, staccato fragments mimic sand grains hitting stone. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or emotional information. Metaphors stay physically coherent: obsidian surface = mirror, graft union = strongest part, coin hole = wound that lets thread pass—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: “firefighter’s hands steady as she spread black volcanic sand” does three jobs (occupation, texture, symbolic legacy) in eleven words.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“insect in amber” condenses time-lock. Zero paraphrase loops; information density high. Copy clean, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate between participle, prepositional, and subject-verb. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence adds new information or emotional layer.

Closural sentence (“listening for the next civilization’s call”) lands with crisp, inevitable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose rhythms echo stonework—measured, tactile, with sentence variety that breathes between description and revelation. No loops or scaffold; information is layered (ribbon as ruler, then map, then grief-music) without redundancy. Metaphors stay physical—“water rings” for cemetery layout—maintaining credibility. One clause of near-simultaneity (“as orange light filtered… she came here”) is minor; otherwise syntax is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm alternates between tidal surge and gear-tick exactitude; no two sentence openings repeat within any paragraph. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor operational: obsidian “black spine” foreshadows the ridge as structural vertebrae supporting the tower. Information density is high—one line can anchor time, ancestry, and sea encroachment. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; even abstract “incremental absolution” is immediately grounded in the tactile transfer scene.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“velveteen gloom settling like moth wings”—survives because it is taught early and reappears in the final line, paying off. Information density high; each sentence advances caretaker ethos or cipher mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence advances world or stake. Figurative control: “blackened tooth” opener is striking yet causally apt. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold—“future” repeated three times in close succession—dulls cadence by 0.2, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density, no scaffold loops; figurative language is spare and coherent (“leaked through her fingers like captured fireflies”). Sentence variety good; opening and closing lines carry image-ear punch. Two near-adjacent “glow” mentions could have been varied, but do not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift; minor typo risk zero. Read-aloud rhythm solid; qualifies for 8.8+ if final image carried more syntactic surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary length to mimic breathing stall; no template cadence. High information density: one line often layers soot, ash, and moral taint. Metaphors are coherent—rocker as metronome of dying—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances ash or porcelain state. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor filter verbs appear (“she understood why”) but are character-appropriate reflection, not dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple overload; occasional soft repeats (“travelled stillness” twice, “velvet” thrice) are minor, and no mixed metaphors or filter-verb clusters mar the climax; final paragraph lands with cadenced lift rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, high-density; sentences do double duty. Metaphor chain around “synaptic/plasticity/neural” repeats four times without new payoff, creating mild template cadence (−0.3). Opening and closing lines carry image-ear punch. No loops or scaffold beyond that cluster; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; long sentence opens, clipped clauses climb. High info density: “copper coils still warm” fuses time lapse and tech detail. No loops or scaffold; “amber” recurs with shifting referents (sky, dusk, pollen) rather than churn. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do triple duty: advance image, deepen character, modulate cadence. Figurative language is spare and disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; final line lands with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely uncluttered; sentences carry double duty—world detail plus emotional charge (“the water around her trembled with consequences”). One metaphor overlap: “coral threading” + “threading her fingers” could feel recursive, but the echo is brief and structurally purposeful. No filter-verb clusters or loops obscure causality. Final paragraph cadence slows to match geological time without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose carries high information density: one sentence often paints time, pigment, and emotional valence. Figurative layer is selective—“waxing moon above into a pale yellow smudge” compresses weeks of smog into a single perception. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Minor scaffold: two “she thought” tags could be cut, but they do not stall momentum or dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “time pooled like standing water” does triple duty—image, theme, physics. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for tour patter, staccato fragments when the violinist weeps. One near-loop: “survive even here…survival worth the effort” could compress; however, the repetition serves cadence of endurance. No mixed metaphors; each figurative turn sustains the aqueous motif.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short gasps to winding clauses; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise (“gray tooth,” “coiled in time”). Density high—each line advances image or causality. Final beat free of overwriting; click of reversal is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: short sentences under mirror pressure, then lyrical cascade during confession. No synonym loops; “green light” recurs with escalating charge rather than churn. Metaphors stay coherent (blur = smoke = possibility). Information density high: single sentence often anchors setting, emotion, and prop state (“She pinned the clasp to her collar and faced the nearest mirror”). Only micro-slip: “like silk dragged across broken glass” edges purple but is voice-motivated and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—each sentence advances stakes, sound, or body. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (fractal recursion) rather than decorative overload. One mixed metaphor—“apple trees clinging to their floating prison”—but it occurs early and accrues character. Minor scaffold: “then she…” cadence appears twice in mid-section; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; stacked metaphors are purposeful and never obscure causality. “Sunwashed dread” recurs like a refrain without lapsing into template cadence. Information density is high—every line advances setting, character, or revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long aquatic sentence mirrors flooded stillness, then staccato micro-choices (“write, fold, wedge”) mimic insertion. Information density high—single sentence can carry occupation, memory, and physical act. No mixed metaphors; “drunken dancers” is earned by prior listing columns. One paraphrase loop (“interlaced absence” twice) forgiven because second use reprices the concept at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “Water damage darkened the lower drawers, but the upper tiers looked intact” simultaneously paints scene, hints time decay, and cues Marcus’s path. No scaffold loops; openings vary; no filler filters. Opening line hooks voice & stakes, closing line returns to “reclaimed stillness” with re-weighted resonance. One near-mixed metaphor (“light through deep water”) but it is character-appropriate and doesn’t dull closure. Prose stays spare, propulsive, information-dense; high-band clarity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; short percussive sentences during gem work, longer lyrical curls for optical phenomena. Metaphors are grounded—basilica “frozen music,” cranes “between memory and lantern”—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold loop: “descended while ascending” recurs four times; because it is taught as optical rule and repriced at closure, drift is minimal. Information density high; each sentence layers craft step with emotional charge. No typos, pronoun clarity clean.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density—most sentences dual-job. Mixed-metaphor guard passed. One paraphrase loop: “bleak exhilaration” appears twice without re-inflation; allowed as motif but still redundant. No scaffold clutter. Final image sharp; no artifact within closure beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Occasional elevated diction (“quantum-locked”) is motivated; clarity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Opening sentence anchors voice and metaphor; no scaffold repetition. Information density high—each sentence advances data or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; only minor paraphrase loop on “she had been trying to change” softens the peak. Metaphors remain coherent (salt-smoothed driftwood = time eroded). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length modulates with mist density, no template cadence. Information-dense lines carry triple duty—e.g., “storms had stripped away all pretense of ownership” fuses setting, politics, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“cupped,” “crushed,” “teetered”—replace modifiers. Opening and final lines frame voice and re-charge object.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is compact and image-dense without purple patches; “fog roll across the water like regret made visible” is earned. Few filter verbs; sentences layer time and sensation (“She’d driven through the night…”). One paraphrase loop: “She could still read… she could still find north” could compress. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line offers resonant release with no cadence clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines multitask: “irony tasted like rust” fuses sensory, evaluative, and world-wearied tone in five words. No paraphrase loops, no filler; rhythm accelerates down the cave, then stills at the lake, mirroring tension without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty (scent + emotion + world rule). No scaffold loops; metaphor chain (spice → memory → substance) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening spondaic pile-ups (“onyx-ink cartomancer”) shift to soft iambs at descent. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language coherent—starlight, marble clouds, porcelain fracture all share brittle-luminous spectrum; no mixed metaphors. Information dense: single sentences layer ink, family custom, and guilt. Closure line “hurrying home to trace new hands together” is crisp, propulsive payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Syntax varies from 28-word elegiac rolls to three-word fragments (“Today they would stitch.”) that mimic needle punctures. No synonym loops; “stitch” is repeated only when the action demands. Metaphors stay coherent—tears as galaxies, hull as quilt, joy as anti-gravity—each reappears to charge closure. Zero scaffold sentences; every line advances image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene heat—long sentence for slow planet drift, short clause for jar twist; metaphors (“beach exhaled heat”) are apt and sparse; no scaffold loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density high—each sentence moves image or stance; final line earns its quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences multi-task: “She knelt beside the sundial’s base, running her hands over the painted angles” delivers motion, setting, and code clue in one sweep. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language spare and purposeful. Final line cadence mirrors key-ring chime, giving audible closure without overwritten flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong verbs (“flared,” “twisted,” “exploded”) and specific nouns (“satchel,” “bluff’s edge”) keep density high; minimal adjective clutter.

Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Proofing is clean; pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence shapes breathe with scene. Mixed metaphors rare (“cathedral of storm and light” slightly grand but fits POV). Information density high—each line layers sensation + symbolism. Only minor scaffold: “furiously tranquil” reused thrice; still, it’s thematic refrain, not artifact. No loops or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates from long, light-threaded openings to staccato blade beats; no template cadence detected. Single paraphrase loop: “waiting—always waiting” is intentional thematic refrain, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent—light, gears, brook—no mixed vehicles.

Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the seed/book hybrid motif with echoic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long, tidal sentences in the arbor; clipped, urban cadence on return. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative control: “steely longing” avoids sentimentality by anchoring in piano timbre. One tiny filter stack (“he understood… he also understood”) but it lands before the climax and doesn’t touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Metaphors are selective, not cluttered; “gray mist…simplifying them” is precise. One scaffold loop: “memories trying to waken, struggling to remain real” restates in adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is oceanic, with purposeful anaphora (“The tides of remembrance…”) that pays off in closure. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“waves that had learned patience over centuries”) so it reads as taught texture, not overload. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”—is absent; diction stays within grieving-teen credulity. Final line lands clean with no artifact clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“silence could amplify the body's whispered truths”) and rhythmic control, varying sentence length to mirror tension. One minor flaw: “shifting grace moved between them—first she held it… then offered it…” edges toward abstraction, slightly muddling the physicality. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or register drift; metaphors (calcified resentment, breathing walls) remain coherent. Final line (“broken, but that hardly mattered anymore”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)

Final line (“purpose”) lands with clean propulsion, echoing the opening’s weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “amber of old laughter” conveys memory, color, and emotion in three words. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer cadences for reflection, staccato beats for tension (“I’m losing the light”).

    Prose is precise and evocative (“rust-colored petals brittle with age,” “light converges and meaning is born from connection”) with strong verbs and varied syntax. Minor redundancy in “bearing witness to his grief and guilt” followed by “shared burdens” slightly dulls momentum. No figurative muddle or register drift; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight through prior concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “leafless apple trees spinning slowly… like skeletal hands” does triple duty (image, mood, foreshadowing). Figurative language is coherent (vortex as “malevolent heart,” confession “frozen” then “released”). Minor overwriting in “warlike serenity” (repeated twice), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors Kael’s outward spiraling—calm, conclusive, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic (“shadows stretching like fingers,” “cities that grew like gardens”), with high information density. Minor overwriting in “temporal rupture” and “eclipsed covenant” edges toward abstraction but is grounded by concrete action.

    Prose is dense with purpose: “sky lanterns rose like slow-burning stars” establishes motif and mood in one stroke. Sentence openings vary (“He dropped,” “Marcus secured,” “The *Meridian* materialized”), and paragraph lengths shift with pressure. One minor flaw: “luminous vows finally escaping their sunken library” slightly strains the metaphor after the concrete dive sequence, risking figurative overload—but it’s redeemed by the immediate grounding in Marcus’s gasp upon surfacing. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“foreign coins spread across the navigation console—remnants from civilizations that existed before the Great Collapse”).

Minor deduction: “excruciatingly gentle” repeats verbatim (setup/payoff), but functions as a charged refrain rather than redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “amber reflection and diesel shimmer,” “sleeping monuments,” “architecture of lies” all do double duty.

Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. One minor artifact: “sidereal patience” appears twice in close proximity (lines 12 and 21), risking slight redundancy, but it’s conceptually necessary. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; clarity remains pristine at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
