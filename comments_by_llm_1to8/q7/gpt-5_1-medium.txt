  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or discovery. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Two deductions: (1) "steadily adaptive" appears twice in identical phrasing, a paraphrase loop that costs −0.2; (2) several lines in the middle third ("I realized then," "Now it held my questions," "Tonight I walked") open with temporal markers in a template cadence, costing −0.4. No major figurative muddle, but "thin and bright, blowing through me like glass rods over a flame" mixes vehicle and tenor in a way that briefly obscures sense. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, but these artifacts prevent entry to the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening fragments ("Every pane trembled...") give way to longer accumulative structures at closure without becoming sluggish. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "tuning fork case someone had found knotted to his lifejacket" anchors object, memory gap, and survival in one beat). Two minor artifacts lower from 8.6: "like wreckage in black water" and "like a curtain lifting" are near-stock metaphors, and the phrase "silently expressive" appears twice with slight redundancy. The final paragraph's longer syntax supports the conceptual expansion without losing propulsion. No paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("sea opened like an eye," "water thick as sleep"). Information density is high in the library description. However, two issues lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3 ("three generations"/"only undertaker left"/"kept at it" all establish weariness without added pressure), and (2) the final paragraph condenses crucial action into summary abstraction ("stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces") rather than concrete sequence, dulling propulsion at closure. Template cadence appears briefly in the chart description ("looped and crossed, diving off"). Applying −0.6 for loops and compression at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening arbor description uses long cadences, the confrontation tightens to short exchanges, the ending expands again. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold: "She reached into the satchel and drew out the bell" is straightforward utility; "the sound of the clapper brushing the rim was barely audible, yet here in the amplified quiet it seemed to lean forward in time" is vivid but borders on overwriting ("lean forward in time" strains the vehicle). No loops or pronoun drift. Clarity remains high even in figurative peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout (mist swallowing sound, ribs under wet skin, sparks battering ribs, lanterns as suns). While vivid, the accumulation risks slight overwriting in the middle third where multiple metaphors layer without rest (corridor/lanterns/sparks/procession/darkness/wound within ~6 lines). Rhythm varies and information density is strong. No paraphrase loops detected. Clarity holds at closure. The "foggy lucidity" phrase recurs twice, the second time feeling slightly scaffolded. Propulsion is steady but the figurative load in peak beats nudges toward the overwriting threshold without crossing into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or thematic accretion. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the arc cleanly. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The bridges rose... time here has never moved only forward; it ricochets" restates the same temporal instability across adjacent beats. The dissolution sequence suffers from figurative overload—"smeared across perception," "emulsion blistering," "outline fray," "histories smeared"—where four metaphors in quick succession blur rather than sharpen the final image. Template cadence in lines like "I see myself as... I see future versions too..." triggers mild momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character motive, or tactical pressure. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally overwritten ("molted scales," "constellations," "dull teeth," "reluctant applause" clustered in adjacent beats) without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence flags. Template cadence appears in the middle third: repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "He [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: the arrow's function as key is restated in two adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, but cumulative artifact load lowers momentum in the second third.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; lines layer action, sensory detail, and thematic weight ("The forge does not burn; it hums"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively under emotional pressure, accelerating at the kitchen memory and slowing at the lacquer-coda. Minor deduction: a few phrases risk lyric overload ("half graveyard, half cathedral," "wounded dawn") that approach but do not cross into opacity. No paraphrase loops; the repetition of "trust breaking" is purposeful recurrence tied to the dominant stake, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("jar of captured moonbeams," "sunset smeared like disbelief," "destiny's door"), creating atmospheric texture but occasionally stalling momentum with ornamental phrasing. Several paraphrase loops appear: "I was not here for trains but for messages" / "Each bouquet... spelled a name, a warning, or a rendezvous" restates the code concept without added pressure. Stock metaphor strings ("sky burned," "destiny's door") and elevated diction in peak beats ("prismatic," "aquarium") reduce immediacy. Sentence openings vary and rhythm generally supports scene needs, but information density dips in the middle third where setup dominates over causal advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and charge the final image. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in runs of figurative language ("Light crept through fractured windows, catching dust and frost, turning the dead panels into dim, watching faces"; "water ticked and slipped from metal like hesitant thoughts")—not incoherent, but dense enough to slightly slow momentum in two beats. No loops, no scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs. Some scaffold phrases recur: "the way a [X] is [Y]" appears three times ("the way kids stare at roadkill," "the way a stunt mark on the floor is familiar," "the way a fight choreographer's map lets terror become timing"), creating mild template cadence. A few near-paraprase loops: the protagonist's fear list is told ("knives, crowds, deep water"), then immediately summarized again ("every phobia in me by first name"), and the seashell's hiss is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without new detail. No major muddle in peak beats, and the final paragraph propels cleanly, but the loops prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("barnacle," "waves gnawed the land," "shipwrecked constellations"), but in peak beats—oracle working, darkness arriving—metaphoric layering ("hollow corridors left behind by vanished light," "darkness strode in") risks overwriting that pulls focus from propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "hollows" and "lean into them" echo "hollow corridors"; "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" repeat the same textural note. Syntax varies well, and no scaffolding obstructs causality, but density in the closure paragraph competes with clarity rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, perception, and stakes ("icicles hung from rusted railings like organ pipes, and in their reflected light the sentient robot janitor named HEPA-3 stood remarkably composed"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through loop iterations ("dozens, then hundreds") and breathing at the touch ("clear tone that seemed to pour through his tactile sensors"). Minor loop detected: "the loop will begin" / "the loop would begin" and "that no one fully understood" / "voluntary...though they both knew" edge toward paraphrase across the opening paragraphs (−0.2). One figurative stretch: "blinked at from behind thick eyelids" for sky-dimming reads slightly forced against the technical idiom. No other scaffold or template cadence; clarity and momentum remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("curiosity burrowed like a patient parasite," "mistrust cracked like thin ice"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Two friction points: "doodles were ambiguously clear" is self-contradictory without clarifying payoff, and "swept thunder" (paragraph 2) strains sense. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is consistent. Overwriting in the opening third does not obscure closure but adds −0.3 for density without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("hedges slumped like tired bureaucrats, gaps yawning where children had torn shortcuts"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "The maze had once been a civic wonder" is followed two sentences later by restating the hedges' decline; the two beats paraphrase without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the commemorative catalog ("If a child had laughed… he would hang… If an office worker paused… he planted"), applying −0.4 for the pattern. No clarity break at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with high information density: "the twin moons smeared thin halos," "subdued awakenings inside might startle." Sentence openings vary; figurative language is purposeful and grounds rather than obscures. Minor issues: a few paraphrase loops ("They are dreaming in intervals" / "each consciousness flickers on a different axis") and slight scaffold in transitions ("He followed Rae…Here the air smelled…"). The closure beat is clean and the overall momentum strong, but these small artifacts prevent entry into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies with strong propulsion through most beats. Information density is high, with sentences advancing discovery and atmosphere simultaneously. However, metaphorical language saturates several passages without pattern-teaching: "pale, swollen leaf," "planets around a drowned sun," "trapdoor," creating density that occasionally slows momentum in the middle third. A minor paraphrase loop appears when describing the phrase's dissonance ("crooked, dissonant" / "snag on silence rather than flow"). Stock metaphors like "patient tide" and "sunken cathedral" are present but don't obscure causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Green auroral sorrow pulsed faintly on its monitor glass, a reflection of distant geomagnetic storms" anchors tone, setting, and symbolic charge). Two minor issues: (1) "swaying certainties, not broken yet, but bending toward some unseen pressure" is a paraphrase loop—"swaying" and "bending" restate the same content without added pressure; (2) "peripherally aware but afraid to look straight on, she had swallowed her questions" slightly restates the prior paragraph's implication. These loops do not touch closure but reduce density in the middle third. No stock metaphors or register drift; grammar and pronoun references are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. The opening ("The tunnel breathes like a sleeping animal") and the valve-wheel description ("carnival crown") are vivid and specific. However, several instances of paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing reduce momentum: "the hush that follows a sudden confession" appears twice verbatim (opening and midpoint), "swallowed truth" recurs four times with diminishing charge, and "religiously skeptical" is repeated identically. The phrase "factory ghost shift" and "line three, the locked stairwell, the tunnel under the hill" carry a slightly templated cadence. These artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the closure image materially, but they accumulate across the piece. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or stakes. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He understood… / He sensed… / He had sworn…" across consecutive paragraphs, creating a repetitive stem pattern (−0.5). Figurative language is dense throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace," "grip reality loosely" all charge moments but cluster heavily in expository beats rather than peak action. No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding. Propulsion slows mid-piece during the transformation sequence but recovers at closure. Pronoun references remain clear; syntax varies adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("Light slanted through blinds in narrow ladders"). Information density is high in the eclipse beat. However, pervasive figurative language in non-peak moments ("a traveling nest," "bright, impatient eyes," "translating...into jokes and hummed cues") accumulates without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting (−0.5). "Softly adaptive" recurs as scaffold (three uses across beats without functional distinction, −0.2 paraphrase-loop). No major clarity breaks, but the density slows momentum in the setup third.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent (walls "holding breath," dreams "slipping out of gear"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines restating the same historical recursion without added detail, but it does not obscure causality or closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and recharge motifs effectively. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language—"orchestrating each fortune by directing flow, not force"—recurs with intent and pays off at closure. However, three instances of mid-pressure template cadence ("I realized then," "That is the thing about," "Down in the village, tomorrow's customers would") slightly dull propulsion. The phrase "familiar enigma" appears three times; while thematic, the repetition risks churn. Clarity and concision are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm generally varies and information density is high, with most lines doing double work (e.g., "dust softened the stained glass light into a muffled clarity" establishes both atmosphere and theme). A handful of near-loops appear: "loop pedal" recurs six times, sometimes in tight proximity; "Jonas" appears as subject in several consecutive beats mid-story. The phrase "over and over" in "captured it and returned it, over and over, building a lattice" reads as intentional echo but borders on redundancy. Figurative language ("lattice of sound," "net cast through rhetorical devices") occasionally clusters without added pressure, though most images remain clear and purposeful. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with Eli's focus. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (image + interiority, motif + stakes). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without clear pattern-payoff, risking overwriting (Density Check: −0.4). "Upturned hush" recurs four times, once as thematic anchor but thrice as filler that could be cut without loss (paraphrase-loop: −0.2). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Clarity holds; the nautilus and mirrored-horizon images are coherent. Propulsion is steady but the closure beat ("waited for the unheard symphony…to rise") loops the opening's passivity rather than advancing to visible act.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and high information density (most lines advance image, action, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent (drop/ripple, shattering futures, tablet as coals). The opening and closing lines anchor and release cleanly. Minor density slip: "The tablet, they had told him, was a map of his possible lives, encoded not in symbols but in algorithms" relies on off-stage exposition where a perceptual cue (tablet's hum, rune behavior) could have implied the encoding without the "they had told him" scaffold. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or mechanism—and syntax varies to support rhythm. Overwriting appears in clusters: "distant thunder refusing to sound," "sleeping heart," "wounded beetle," and "vines, curling up their legs and spines, coaxing chill places awake" stack figurative language in adjacent sentences without pattern-teaching, applying −0.5 in Q7. A paraphrase loop ("audibly muted" / "mirrored hush" / "filament of hush") recurs without functional shift, adding −0.2. Stock metaphor "ice in spring" at closure adds −0.2. Total deduction −0.9 from a base ~8.1. No causality obscured, so penalties remain here. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density, strong propulsion, vivid figurative language ("storms of movement and surveillance," "veins carrying news through a sleeping body"). Rhythm varies and accelerates cleanly through discovery, decode, listen, observe, decide. Minor deductions: two paraphrase loops—"Recognition fluttered…arrived" echoes "the temptation…burned, but habit demanded" and "between them…came a pulse" restates the listening setup. Template cadence appears in reflective beats: "I was…I lived…I would record" across three paragraphs. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 for pattern artifacts, but they do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. However, paraphrase loops appear: "terra-cotta grotto under starlight" restated as "hollow of cooled clay, walls glowing like low embers under starlight" within two lines; "choices" and "texture" recur frequently without added pressure. Template cadence in the poet's monologue ("They always stop… Only then do we see…") reads as intentional patterning but flattens momentum in the middle third. Figurative language is dense (wound/womb, frayed coil, silvered fibers) without muddle, but "passionate subtlety" in the final beat feels label-like rather than embodied. No major line-level artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully, though figurative language clusters densely in the first third ("shell held to the ear," "drowned cathedral," "tired messenger," "smoke braided the stars") without always advancing pressure—approaching but not crossing the overwriting threshold. Minor template cadence in mid-section: "The chronic hush..." "The city does not notice..." "Curiosity, more than hunger..." No paraphrase loops. Final beat is lean and propulsive. Deduct −0.4 for figurative density in setup that doesn't all constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, participial, and subordinate clauses. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "His smile was kind without belonging to him, as if borrowed for the evening from a warmer, braver man" conveys both appearance and thematic resonance). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("syrupy, honeyed sorrow," "mud, rain, and shifting footsteps"). Minor deduction for two instances of slight overwriting: "threading itself through my nerves like silver roots" followed immediately by layered metaphors risks density fatigue, and "tasting of weak tea" + "sharp as bitten glass" in close succession creates minor metaphor crowding. No loops or scaffold detected; propulsion is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied. Information density is high in the opening (harbor lights, library, symphony, envelope backstory) without losing momentum. Minor loops: "quiet" recurs across "quiet guardians," "quiet labor," "quiet punctuation"; "cautious exuberance" is named once but not fully embodied in syntax. Template cadence in the backstory paragraph: "He opened it... and instead found... A locket photo tumbled... The letter was signed..." (past-tense march). The phrase "whimsically attentive" appears twice in quick succession. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in a few beats. The final image ("this chance friendship might reshape what his harbor valued") is strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "marsh-reed sculptor who shaped brittle stalks into figures that remembered rain" conveys occupation, medium, aesthetic). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor scaffold: "They say the trees sprouted from echoes" and "Rumor said that if you stayed through three nightfalls" are near-synonyms for hearsay framing within eight paragraphs—paraphrase loop, −0.2. Template cadence in the Mira introduction ("Im Mira, muralist, failed cartographer, and part-time orchard guide") reads list-like but brief. Figurative density ("glass leaves trembling," "tender graffiti," "luminescent ache") risks saturation in peak beats; one or two could be pruned for propulsion without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: "I closed my eyes and let the hum crawl up my arms and into my chest" does sensory, agency, and progression work in one beat. Minor paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "Sometimes the pendant cooled... Sometimes it flared hot" is functional rhythm rather than true loop, and "I understood then" / "I realized" scaffold lightly but do not obscure causality. Figurative language is vivid and consistent: "sound peeled away from the city like paint," "time draped around us like clay." No template cadence or register drift mars the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats, but overwriting clusters in the opening third: nearly every sentence in paragraphs 8–11 carries figurative language ("chipped tesserae like a spell," "unfinished motion," "coaxed rain from dry wells," "moss threads," "spirals neither growing nor shrinking"). Mixed metaphor: "leaves like dim hands cupping sound" while stalactites are "slow clocks"—sensory vehicles collide. Template stems appear ("His magic is not... it is," "The orchard hums... the air contracting"). Apply −0.6 for density without pattern-teaching and −0.3 for template cadence, totaling −0.9 in this category. Figurative muddle does not touch the closure beat directly, so deductions stay within non-closure cap range.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "phantom pulses," "cobweb") is vivid but clustering in early paragraphs risks overwriting without functional payoff. One paraphrase loop: "cache small beacons of sense memory" / "cached fragments and whispers" repeats the caching concept without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "Marrow [verb]," flattening propulsion slightly. Stock metaphor: "standing at the ledge of giving up" is a familiar phrase. The closure paragraph ("In the trembling… as presence") lands cleanly with no artifact muddle. Proofreading is clean; no grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the piece avoids template cadence except for one brief run: "She lowered shade cloths, checked gutters, and moved fragile flats" reads slightly mechanical. Two moderate issues: (1) "circuitously sincere" appears twice, once in dialogue-like labeling ("the circuitously sincere detours") and again in backstory summary ("She told the story in brisk, circuitously sincere phrases"), creating mild redundancy; (2) the phrase "mossy trellis after rain" recurs three times as a location anchor, twice identically, which edges toward template even if intentional. The metaphor "storms twisted the wind into knots" is slightly strained. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion remain strong, with figurative language (jeweled water, ghost of sky, wounds burning in her chest) integrated without density overload. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("breathing sea," "vertebrae," "bruise remembering"). Two slips lower the score: "the world was trying to tell her something in a language of trapped wings and hardened sap" edges into stock lyricism, and the final beat's "exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate" is slightly overwritten, abstract where image would serve better. Minor paraphrase loop: "amber brooch" and variations appear in six consecutive beats, some purely descriptive. Information density is high elsewhere; no scaffold or template cadence. These artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so penalty remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening fragments ("Everything that mattered would happen after") create voice. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, several beats stack figurative language without earned pressure: "bright darkness dripped," "chandeliers...pulsed like sleeping hearts," "dust leap like startled insects" cluster in mid-section without pattern payoff. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" appears twice without functional difference. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraph 10–11 both establish Mira's relief at the cave's disruption. Cumulative minor artifacts prevent high-band entry but closure beats remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short declaratives ("Words were the hardest to carry") punctuate longer, layered observations—and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("words…leaked into each other, smearing meanings the way rain smeared chalk"). The opening and closing images bookend the piece with tonal consistency. However, two patterns accumulate minor drag: (1) "staggered intervals" recurs in three separate paragraphs with near-identical phrasing ("walking ten measured paces, pausing, listening," "Through staggered intervals of walking, listening, and writing," "Through those staggered intervals of silence and speech"), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum mid-piece; (2) "Old Caven…beard clotted with sea salt, eyes leaking the same water that slicked the stones" stacks two liquid metaphors in quick succession, blurring the image. These artifacts do not obscure causality but prevent entry to the 9-band. Overall density and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong concrete detail ("columns rose like patient giants"). However, several passages show template cadence and filter-verb stacks: "He had mapped...yet those deliberate fissures had not appeared...They were new," and multiple "He had" constructions in the opening section create repetitive sentence openings. The phrase "trembling certainty" appears twice verbatim as a set phrase, and some metaphors stretch toward overwriting ("trains made entirely of vapor, their shapes defined by constellations"). Information density is generally high, but the repetitive syntactic patterns in the first third create noticeable drag before the piece accelerates toward the station sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; many sentences do multiple jobs ("Grandmother had been courageously kind, arguing with priests and captains yet always offering them tea afterward" packs trait, action, and social context). Clarity is high. Deductions: paraphrase loops appear ("Do not be afraid of remembering" / "I am not afraid, I answered"; "sculpt space for reflection" repeated across three paragraphs), and some metaphors strain coherence ("whales drew silver scars across the sea" mixes vehicle logic awkwardly). Template cadence in the memory-layering section ("Under that, a deeper layer surfaced") slightly flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates effectively ("The first crack in space sounded like hushed thunder" opens with controlled cadence; closure slows to match contemplation). Information density is high: most lines advance concept, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor density slip: "Its charged particles slammed into the upper air, shaking every magnetic field my escondite depended on for secrecy" could compress. No loops, filters are voice-motivated, and figurative language ("crown of bent nails," "intrigue on a geometric scale") clarifies rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at discovery, breathing at reflection. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor density slip: "deathly vitality that never quite lets me sleep" is evocative but does not advance plot. Figurative language (ink as mental solvent, body as puzzle) is consistent and earns its space. Opening and closing lines charge the frame cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is high; rhythm varies naturally and sentences layer jobs (e.g., "leaves catching the first gray hints of dawn" anchors time, setting, and mood). Strong specificity: "battered notepad, its corners rounded by years," "fragile futures...never demanded at the counter." Minor scaffold detected: "He writes..." opens multiple consecutive paragraphs in the middle third, creating template cadence (-0.3). "Fragile" recurs (fragile celebrations, fragile futures, fragile stories) without evolution (-0.2 paraphrase loop). No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn in peak beats; propulsion is steady but could tighten in the reflective middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally, with shorter beats during the container-voice moment and longer reflective blocks that anchor in present stimuli (walking, staring at the label). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs—though some mid-passage reflection ("He decided that to discover the texture of memories, he had to forget chronology") leans slightly toward tell without immediate micro-choice payoff. Figurative language (frozen waves, manufactured cliff, sound traveling strangely) is coherent and voice-motivated, not overwrought. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The final image is concrete and purposeful, recharging the poison label and blank-line motif without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies naturally—short declaratives ("She laughed once, a sound like a dropped screw") alternate with longer syntactic waves. Figurative language is dense but purposeful: "condensed into a single sour kernel," "shame bloom like slow rust," "permission… less like ending than rehearsal." One minor template-cadence run appears mid-story ("The hum matched… Its maker had vanished… Tamsin touched") but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops; scaffold is minimal. Propulsion is consistent; clarity remains high even in the lyric register. Metaphors cohere without mixing vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loops: "The Carnies wanted the opposite: a labyrinth so wild no title deed could find purchase" is restated in different words two paragraphs later. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]" stems. Stock phrases: "racing pulse," "like slow, hungry sharks," "tasted of hopeful desperation." Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff: "neon tides," "schools of fish," "serpent wrapped around three barges" all appear in quick succession in the final third. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (loops and template cadence) warrant −1.5 total within this category.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high and propulsion strong through the countdown structure. Figurative language ("stranded iceberg," "knife-edged away," "velvet dark") vivid but controlled. Two line-level issues: "That something was a single grain…" after "He had come to photograph the last of something precious" is a paraphrase loop that restates rather than advances (−0.3). "The mission brief called this…the dawning hush, as if quiet could be scheduled. / Ilya preferred the older word: morning" toggles terminology without adding pressure, a scaffold move (−0.2). Otherwise clean syntax, clear action order, no grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines layer action, sensation, and thematic resonance ("The rails and the sea shared their trembling music through the stones"). Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, slowing for diagnostic work and quickening at release. Minor artifacts: "traced the air with careful hands" and "heartfelt artisan" read slightly generic; "as gently as if it were a nervous animal" is a stock simile. Two adjacent lines near the middle paraphrase the same teaching point ("Direction is not a straight road" / "You decode feedback into direction"), which could tighten. No loops obscure causality; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Someone, perhaps even myself, was trying to herald a correction…" advances mystery, character doubt, and stakes). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates across the ice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for "worrying tranquility" appearing twice in close proximity and slight filter-verb stacking in the condensation-watching beat ("watched them gather, merge, and trail"). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line recharges the falcon and discovery motifs with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density is high—"fog listened," "kindly iron suns," "vowel of surprise," "frozen applause for nothing"—and mostly coherent, though "kindly iron suns" for bells verges on strained. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: "He waited...as if time itself had hired him" leans decorative, and "the town shivered awake" + "the work of revival finally began" risks redundancy in the ending. Information density is strong; rhythm breathes with the measured pace. One late slip: "fragile morning" after "wild hush" and "shivered awake" adds a third modifier to the same moment without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance setting, stakes, or recalibrate the vial's function. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the discovery ("There was no body, no data drive") contrast with longer accumulative sentences in the memory sequence. Minor scaffold detected: "The world inside the control sphere changed; the lighting did not shift, yet every shadow seemed to deepen" restates the same content across the semicolon without new pressure (−0.2). One near-loop: "lonesome splendor" appears twice with slight variation, but the reprise charges the final line and reads purposeful. No metaphor muddle, no template cadence runs, and the final beat ("I felt the lonesome splendor of being remembered by what I remembered") integrates prior motifs with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, backstory, or discovery. Figurative language ("exhausted bruise," "black teeth of stone," "stacked mouths") is vivid and coherent, though density approaches saturation in the opening third without pattern-teaching. Two instances of synonym churn: "whisper ways it can be changed" / "story...sustains impossibilities" / "new story can be born" cycle similar concepts across adjacent paragraphs. Minor scaffold: "I mean to grow one strong enough to open stone" states intent already shown. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats; rhythm varies across sentence lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Line-level propulsion is strong in the vision sequence and vow. However, several beats exhibit overwriting: stacked metaphors in quick succession ("her smile slanted, sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water" immediately following "Her words struck the bead, and something rang inside my chest"), and elevated diction in peak moments ("mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness") that slightly obscures immediacy. No scaffold loops detected, and information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme), and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Minor overwriting in the opening ("mind stitched with lines of verse no one has asked to hear," "ghosts of broken precedents that whisper in its corridors") edges toward stock lyricism but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is concentrated but coherent: "moon drags a pearl path," "walls washed in violet moon-sheen," "floor itself seems sewn with his wandering." Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during physical action ("They had uncovered only fragments"), longer accumulative clauses in reflective beats ("suspended between languages, between airports, between unfinished prayers"). Information density is high—most sentences advance setting, character, or pressure—but some scaffold remains: "The orchard seemed to lean closer, trunks and bones listening together for what would happen next" tells what was already shown. A few repetitive stems appear ("Something in…," "She traced…," "Leila…") and the phrase "interrupted journeys" recurs without always adding pressure. The final image's clarity and propulsion compensate, and no loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat. Grammar and mechanics are clean; copy consistency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or world-rule. Minor scaffold in the trial-names paragraph: "Each name hovered…waiting for the weight of a story that would justify it" restates what the list already showed, costing ~−0.2. One paraphrase loop near "They were carefully inventive…nudging reality by adding small, plausible labels" and the earlier "licensed to invent lives that letters could wear"—both describe the same inventive habit without new pressure, costing ~−0.2. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent and voice-motivated; no mixed metaphors. Final image is propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (frost as ghosts' fingerprints, conspiracies that unravel and reweave, flame as rumor-listener) is vivid and mostly coherent. Sentence openings vary. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "follow one tributary…follow another," "when histories are rewritten, places without stories become easy to erase, and those who walk there vanish completely" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template stems recur ("she had learned," "her task was to synchronize," "the court thought her harmless"). Filter verbs ("feeling the rumors…swirling," "sounding almost amused") stack in the prince's scene. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for filter-verb density in a high-pressure beat. Total artifact debt: −0.9, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping this category at mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "gargoyle's rainspout shard veined with salt and old soot" conveys object, history, and thematic weight). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the vision and breathing in the return. Two minor artifacts: "their song sharpening from lullaby to inquiry" and "singing to the place where every apology still waits unspoken" repeat the apology-waiting motif without adding pressure, a paraphrase loop that costs −0.3. "Fierce tenderness" recurs three times, the third instance ("fierce tenderness masked as accusation") justified by reweighting, but the phrase borders on over-deployment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: "coral turned shrapnel by politics" compresses backstory into a single image. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through the cast-reading ("syllables backlit by operating lamps") and breathing in the mother's coral-press moment. Minor pattern: "As the doors swung shut" and "Out in the atrium" use similar openings within three lines, creating brief template cadence (-0.2). Otherwise, no loops or scaffold; figurative language (lotus, ghost-letters, tide lines) remains coherent and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Branches rose like ribs from the collapsed greenhouses, rattling whenever the unseen sun shifted above"). No loops or scaffolding. However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("like ribs," "like an intruder," "like captured dawn," "like exposed film," "like sleeping beetles," "like crooked chandeliers")—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a -0.5 deduction for overwriting density under the tightened penalty guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "Stone ribs arched over the path, tuned cavities that caught passing noise and gave it back"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "smaller thoughts woke, each containing an even smaller doubt" echoes the nested-figures motif without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("The figure was...Within her pupils...The stone ribs caught...") with repeated subject-verb stems. Stock metaphor ("soldiers") and one instance of filter-verb stacking in a reflective beat ("I thought," "I felt") apply minor deductions. The final image is strong, but the prose artifacts in peak beats prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances world-building, character stance, or the lexicon project. Rhythm varies purposefully, and metaphors ("bottled moons," "dry little heart") remain coherent. Minor template-cadence echoes appear in the exposition blocks ("According to law... According to us," "Mara taps... Jin adds") but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion stays clean through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("hammock of woven kelp and listening ink"), but several beats stack metaphors without causal advance: "reef-shadow joy" is repeated across paragraphs with minimal reweighting, and "shyly unstoppable" appears twice identically. Template cadence is present in runs like "He gathered… The postcard was… On its bent surface… On the back…" and "If you return… Shine on… Drench us…". Paraphrase loops occur: "The moon should have lain there… Instead, the horizon yawned blank" restates absence without adding pressure. These artifacts lower momentum in mid-beats, though the closure image itself remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "slow rainbows that drifted like dust," "thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret," "a hungry sound leaking into the catalogued silence." While the images are vivid and voice-consistent, their concentration in nearly every sentence creates slight overwriting in a few beats (e.g., the opening three paragraphs stack metaphor without advancing pressure). Two paraphrase loops appear: "the sound of forgotten names" / "the exact texture of how they once trembled on a tongue" restate the same idea across adjacent lines; "deserted marvels" appears twice in identical phrasing. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the lyric mode. The final image—"listening to the new orchid light consolation"—is compressed but legible. Deductions: −0.3 for figurative density in the opening, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, −0.2 for repeated phrase = baseline ~7.4, reduced to 6.9 for cumulative texture drag.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the vow-construction beat. However, several figurative constructions in adjacent lines approach density overload without pattern-teaching: "like fossilized ribs," "like a patient eye," "like a harness," "like braided wire" cluster in the first half. "Attentive as a jury" and "the wild relief" work, but "symphonies of truth" repeats from paragraph to paragraph without evolving pressure. Minor scaffold: "I vowed to..." repeated in two consecutive sentences. Propulsion is strong in the second half, and the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with lyric compression in the opening ("listening as the building breathes in dust and exhales forgotten applause") giving way to clearer syntax as the council arrives. Information density is high in the adhesive-analysis passage (families licking the envelope in turn, mixed saliva revealing distrust and shared worry) and the chain's symbolic work (measuring first channels, links that cannot change length but can touch differently). Overwriting cluster: multiple figurative constructions stack within single paragraphs without clear escalation ("echoing ribs of stone," "snarled customs," "quarrels into measured flow," "kindness inside the code"), creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Minor template cadence in the council's entrance: "A mill captain scoffed... a priest argued... a noblewoman demanded" follows parallel stems without variation. No paraphrase loops or pronoun ambiguity; grammar and tense are clean. The phrase "as the building breathes" recurs three times and functions as intentional motif rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two penalties: "a forgotten lung above the city" and "slow trumpet" push elevated diction without full grounding in Noel's craftsman POV, risking mild register drift. Line "mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" repeats the method twice in close proximity, a minor loop. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high and propulsion is sustained. Clarity at closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor and charge. Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, character logic, or symbolic layering. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent ("clouds broke into slow hexagons," "grain rose in ripples"). Minor deduction: "idea of him had been erased and redrawn" is slightly abstract for a peak beat, and "featherly determined" recurs identically twice without variation, a small scaffold slip.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, interiority, thematic charge). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the light experiment and breathing in the bioluminescent shrimp moment. However, figurative language clusters densely in non-peak beats without pattern-teaching ("drowned avenues," "skeletal railings," "algae-furred statues" in quick succession), and several phrases loop conceptually: "coastline that kept rearranging itself" echoes "rhythm of belonging" without added pressure. The burnt feather description contains slight redundancy ("the last relic of my surface life" restates what "leaving" already conveys). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but density in early paragraphs flirts with overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world logic, or Lio's task. Rhythm varies naturally ("Lio watched them bounce and roll into crevices, each seed a possible story waiting for its own weather"). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: a few ornamental constructions risk overwriting without full payoff—"a bright sort of sorrow, this work, like whistling in fog you knew would never lift" is evocative but the simile slightly overstays; "spaced across the text, such density could feel relentless rather than purposeful." Figurative language is controlled and mostly coherent, though "small dark crab skittering" and "drunken cartwheels" mix registers slightly. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and lengths; figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, overwriting appears in high-concept beats: "seashell pressed to the cosmos," "calculated wilderness of circuitry," "guitars hum in sympathy when one string is plucked" stack metaphors without sharp causality. Paraphrase loops emerge in the middle section (multiple lines restate Marcus reading the crowd's body language with slight synonym variation: "eyes narrowing, shoulders tilting," then "leaned closer on beats two and four"). The closing lines summarize rather than propel: "he was not here to dazzle, but to tilt the board just enough that new moves became visible" restates the premise instead of advancing it. Template cadence in the crowd-observation sequence ("A woman... A fisherman... Two teenagers...") is functional but mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without always earning its weight: "spontaneously anchored," "fledge," "dermal constellations," "tide returning to a forsaken cove" risk density overload. Minor paraphrase loop: "elective exile" repeated across two paragraphs without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is generally strong, but the cumulative ornamental load in the middle third trims momentum slightly. Closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery ("erased sketches," "rippled with quiet rainbows"). Information density is high in setting beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "glass remembers impacts, and so do harbors" restates the prior reflection without adding pressure; "the only place in town where light still bothered to slow down and show its workings" and the final "what the water and the glass agreed upon" circle similar territory. Template cadence in reflection-heavy paragraphs (e.g., multiple "I [verb]" openers) and figurative density in nearly every sentence of key beats trigger a −0.6 deduction for pervasive pattern without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (embers as reverse stars, cracks spreading like secrets) is coherent and voice-driven. Information density is high in the backstory compression. Minor loop: "the box had lived with me through smoke seasons, its crackled glaze mirroring my own scars" and the earlier "cracked porcelain box...its hairline fractures spreading the way secrets spread" restate the mirroring motif without advancing it. The phrase "so I had believed on the night I bargained my innocence away" reads slightly scaffolded, cuing the reader toward theme rather than trusting the dramatized shed scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setup, test, or closure. Rhythm varies (short declarations, longer reflective turns) without template cadence. Minor loop: "lucidly watchful" repeats in paragraph 2 and 18 without added pressure (−0.2). "Trial balloons, mathematical models I launched in silence like invisible lanterns" stacks metaphors that slightly blur. Filter-verb use ("I saw," "I felt," "I wanted") clusters in the opening third but eases later. No major scaffold or clarity breaks; the figurative density in "braided the moonlight" and "slipping around my fingers" enriches without obscuring cause/effect at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing discovery, character, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and Read-aloud ear test passes cleanly. Minor loop issue: "corridors upon corridors" and "layers of conversation...layers...like sediment" repeat the stacking metaphor without added nuance (−0.2). A few figurative stacks in the opening third ("petals touched by frost," "spider silk," "underwater bells") risk density but remain legible and voice-consistent, so no overwriting penalty. The final image is propulsive and specific. No grammar, tense, or pronoun drift; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, action, or thematic charge. Rhythm varies effectively—short declaratives ("Tonight their purpose was focused as a blade") alternate with longer lyric constructions—and the prose avoids template cadence. Minor deductions accumulate: "perceptively calm" appears twice in identical phrasing for both painter and girl (paraphrase loop); the opening's "remembered every footstep…remembered silence" is elegant but introduces mild redundancy; and "dark mirror, waiting for something worth reflecting" / "bare silver of mirrors" / "mirrors…misted, then cleared" cycles the mirror motif without always adding pressure. The closure sequence is clean and propulsive, and no artifacts touch the final beats. Overall, strong craft with scattered non-closure slips that prevent entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "ebony clipboard...as though it were fragile armor" conveys prop, character state, and symbolic weight). Clear propulsion through the ritual sequence. Deductions: "operatively gentle" recurs as a template phrase (−0.3); "price of redemption" appears three times in similar phrasing, risking loop (−0.2); one paraphrase near the end ("those who died are beyond our reach; those unborn are entirely within it" echoes the prior framing without added pressure, −0.2). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the central ritual. Rhythm varies naturally with long contemplative sentences ("Five years to manufacture a drought...") alternating with shorter staccato beats ("I followed"). Figurative language is dense but controlled—"ghost vein in a bleached hand," "cracks spidered in every direction, senseless as madness"—with most images purposeful rather than ornamental. Minor deduction for two near-paraphrase moments: "The fissures beneath my boots converged and separated" followed immediately by "dried riverbeds became cartography" restates the same observation without added pressure (−0.3). One filter-verb stack in paragraph starting "What I never told" ("could still hear," "would rise") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality (−0.2). No loops or template cadence; scaffold is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled with varied sentence length and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high; most lines carry image, action, or thematic charge. However, a cluster of metaphor-dense passages in the sanctuary sequence risks overwriting: "each beat of her heart a muffled drum of defiance" followed by "drawing poems on her skin in invisible ink" and "her silence into an uprising of pauses" stack figurative language without breathing space, blurring clarity under peak pressure. Some lines loop conceptually: "echoes were what remained when a feeling died politely" is elegant but paraphrased two beats later as "bound to repeat only the moment of refusal." A few filter-verb stacks ("felt the palace," "let them mark her") dull immediacy. No grammar or continuity errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The opening and closing images anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies effectively: "Everyone drifted out except Lily and Marcus" breathes after the heated argument; "The applause felt like rain on someone else's drought" compresses the festival betrayal with specificity. Minor template cadence in the reflection sequence ("Years ago I filmed... So I began... There I could test") and one paraphrase loop ("meteor hush" restated as "the kind of stillness") create small drag. The closing sentence's syntactic parallelism ("listened... chose not to escape but to orbit") feels purposeful rather than mechanical. No clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes without scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally ("She plucked long grasses…she arranged shelves…every tower, every arch") and accelerates during the monarch's climb. Clarity is maintained throughout; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor density concern: "History, she thought, was not lost all at once, but in these little hesitations where stories failed to land" borders on over-articulated thematic statement but remains anchored in the present stimulus (the monarch's faltering flight). One figurative cluster in the opening third ("green lantern," "blushing stillness," "esoteric realist") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so no overwriting penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("rope seized that guilt and softened it, spinning my failure into a flexible mold"), yet several beats verge on overwriting: "a snowmelt ardor that stung my eyes and thawed the old, stiff apology lodged behind my tongue" stacks three metaphoric vehicles in one line, creating slight muddle. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "I imagined… With each strand… A sibilant hiss… Then came…" runs through similar stems without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops, but synonym churn is present ("preserve," "freezing," "casting," "pouring") without always adding new pressure. Information density is strong in peak beats (rope-touching, bell-shivering), but reflective passages could tighten. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "the bunker" appears as subject in five sentences within the opening paragraphs, creating slight repetition without synonym churn. Stock metaphor: "corridors" for familiar dream-paths is generic but brief. The phrase "decaying directive that held him underground" does double work (plot + metaphor) effectively. Figurative language ("frayed edge where choices rubbed themselves raw") is purposeful and spaced. No major clarity loss, but the loop and one stock image prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere). The courtyard experiment sequence propels cleanly. Weaknesses: paraphrase loops appear ("Museum curators called him Tammuz, though he insisted names were merely coordinates" restates the theme stated two sentences prior in different terms; "empirically ironic" and "encrypted devotion" are glossed redundantly). Template cadence: "He set his notebook… unwrapped the tile… traced the border numerals… opened the notebook" stacks four "he [verb]" openers across successive beats. Elevated diction ("schematic representations," "uncloak its intention") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase + template stack.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "His name was Ilen, a scheming pacifist whose plots never harmed but always unsettled" introduces character, occupation, and thematic tension). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("walls shimmered as if they were trapped horizons," "reality curls and uncurls to expose the knots we hide"). Two minor issues prevent higher score: slight paraphrase loop in the car-memory passage ("I felt... I felt... I clung") adds −0.2; one mixed-register moment ("cognitive smoothness" implied by "cellular memory" jargon, though it's Ilen's term) adds −0.1. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No template cadence or scaffold. Overall strong momentum with hairline drag in the trauma-replay sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: nearly every line advances atmosphere, craft action, or boundary-thinning. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or loops detected. Figurative language ("glass mountains," "trapped frost mites," "anchors dropped through a frozen sea") is dense but coherent and serves the accumulative design. Minor density concern: a few lines restate fog-breathing mechanics without new pressure, costing ~−0.3 within band, but no artifact obscures the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative lines giving way to clipped action during the pruning sequence. Two patterns warrant attention: "endearingly feisty" appears twice identically, and the phrase "deciduous vows" recurs three times, the third instance ("We could abandon ironclad contracts and learn instead from deciduous vows") bordering on expository summary. The closure image is clean and propulsive, and there are no paraphrase loops. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies ("The orchard was the museum, and the museum was the book, and the book was still being written" vs. shorter declaratives in the bathroom scene). However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every line carries metaphor or symbolic freight—and some constructions verge on overwriting: "breathless margins," "guilty fireflies," "soft green lanterns" cluster without clear escalation in pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the gap-mapping sequence. Minor loops appear: "the mountain" is named repeatedly in adjacent lines (paragraph 15, 29), and "she" + past-tense verb runs dominate the descent sequence without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense throughout ("mountain murmured," "air crowded with unshelved melodies") but mostly coherent. The final image ("script shimmered, branched like new veins on a leaf") lands clearly. No major causality obscurement, but template cadence and synonym churn ("carefully resourceful" appears twice identically) lower the score. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across the mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Imagery is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "groaned like a sleeping animal," "emerald swatch card...every square a different memory of grass," "smoke audience sighed as though turning a page." Sentence structures vary purposefully and information density is high. However, several adjacent lines loop conceptually without adding pressure: "Time here does not pass forward or backward; it thickens and thins as memories alter, knitting themselves into new patterns" followed by "To navigate I followed stories left behind, tugging at faded banners and graffiti as though pulling myself through narrative threads" restates the navigation-by-story idea. The theater transformation sequence stacks metaphors densely ("Seats sprouted into hedges...aisles curled into paths...silhouettes...unraveled into threads of ink") without a clear physical anchor, creating brief opacity at a key turn. Proofreading is clean; no tense drift or pronoun ambiguity. The final paragraph's clarity ("rewriting us together") recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths shift purposefully. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, several beats show scaffold and near-loops: "Standing among the gears, Lysa felt the odd, clear complexity…" followed by "Something in this room wanted her to do what she always did…" restates the same realization. "The rope from the seal's emblem was here as well" is mildly redundant after the seal description. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought," "considered") cluster in reflective passages without adding pressure. No figurative muddle, and clarity holds at closure, but tightening would eliminate the −0.6 drag from template cadence and paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character craft, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully (short clauses at peak pressure, longer breath during sensory mapping). Minor deductions: a few decorative flourishes approach overwriting ("ghost movements of glaciers," "reversed snowfall") and one near-paraphrase loop in the opening (storm as verdict/weather/intention). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No template cadence, no major loops, no clarity loss. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the final metaphor (hammer laid down) recharges the anvil motif without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse; figurative language ("thistle-blown hope," "salt flower," "tethered beast") is vivid and thematically coherent. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causal setup. Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun drift or tense slips. Deductions: mild overwriting in the opening third—"lightless flashes," "radio ghosts that howled," "glutted with signals," "mosaicked with satellites"—stacks metaphor without always serving immediate pressure (−0.3). One paraphrase loop: paragraphs beginning "He told himself" and "It was a thistle-blown hope" restate his motivation across adjacent beats without new information (−0.2). A few elevated-diction choices ("flensed," "retrocognitively") are apt but risk slight register drift for a solitary custodian's interior voice. No scaffold or template cadence; propulsion is steady. Final image is strong and concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, world logic, or stakes ("emotions evaporated from plazas and kitchens, now drifting upward"). Rhythm varies naturally and figurative language is controlled and coherent. Minor issues: "deepening hush" recurs four times without reweighting, edging toward motif checklist; a few near-paraphrases ("shadows revealed... he noted where the stormlight shortened some, sharpened others" closely restates the prior shadow-reading concept). No loops touch closure, so non-closure cap applies: baseline strong execution with −0.3 for the hush repetition and mild synonym drift.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid without overwhelming clarity ("ladder from sparks, rung by glittering rung," "sky is a stubborn page"). Minor density issue: a few adjacent lines restate content without adding pressure ("He thinks them brave for staying put when every instinct screams to be brightly elsewhere" closely echoes the prior garrison context). Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" stems across several lines (He kneels, He listens, He studies, He ties, He arranges), creating mild rhythmic monotony. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; closure image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance perception or metaphor. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the pool-touch moment. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent reflective beats ("I had come to the grotto hoping..." / "But the pause only deepened...") that restate waiting without added pressure (−0.2). Some figurative density in mid-passage ("time here was not a river but a shore, each moment a different kind of sand") borders overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops touch closure; the final line is direct and imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Strong images: "my fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots," "every unspoken word had been gold leaf pressed against my tongue." Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I came for," "I had a purpose," "I began to carry") slightly dulls propulsion. One paraphrase loop: "each crossbar a hand held out" is echoed by "hands wide as if accepting a delayed embrace" without added pressure. No loop touches closure. "Intangibly tangible" and "stretching contracted" read as lyric compression rather than muddle, but the pattern isn't taught early enough to fully authorize the density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("trembling with a fading train whistle," "fog-heavy" eyes, "tight noise of unspoken days"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character, or pressure. Minor overwriting: "vaulting hush," "star-colored shards," and "gentled breaths" cluster near closure without muddle, but "needled crystals" and "feathered" storm glass readings could be clearer on first pass. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity remains high throughout; no artifacts obscure cause/effect. One metaphor slips slightly: "hush vaulting from gondola to terrace" mixes spatial and acoustic registers but doesn't break comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every beat without pattern-taught payoff ("ghosted with obsolete satellites," "liquid prism," "autumn leaves of culture," "starlit roots," "cautious ghost"), creating modest overwriting that slows momentum in the orchard and stairway sequences (−0.5). The final third's clarity holds, so the artifact penalty remains bounded. Stock metaphors ("technological snow," "nostalgic about his arrival") and minor paraphrase loops ("each step replaying… under his boots" / "the murals… shifted from pixelated tableaux to rough… scenes") add modest drag (−0.3). No template cadence or major loops; grammar and pronoun references are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and most sentences advance image or pressure. Minor artifacts: "rehearsed silences and gentle excuses" is near-synonym churn; "the thin line of the threshold flicker along her skin like static" is a mixed metaphor (line/flicker/static); "trembling horizon" in the penultimate beat edges purple without clear vehicle. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; no outright loops. Information density is strong, yet the repeated framing of breath and threshold risks redundancy across the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("drowned city," "ideas…congealing into something with teeth," "tidal lines"). Two frictions: register drift into elevated diction ("barometric storms," "depthless") occasionally clashes with the grounded mushroom-farmer POV during high-pressure beats, and a paraphrase loop appears ("the bolt warmed, then tugged" / "gravity had remembered something personal"). Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere and stakes—and sentence openings vary. Clarity holds throughout; no ambiguous pronouns or simultaneity errors. Propulsion is consistent, though the metaphorical layering in the middle third risks slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, memory, or action. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection and quickening as the voice emerges. The final paragraph risks overwriting with stacked metaphors ("bloomed in his mind… curling along the table… crest of possibility") and slight paraphrase when "concentrate a decision" and "topple a whole, brittle pattern" restate theme. The "bridge of intuition" motif threads through but edges toward abstraction in the closing lines. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative language clusters in the closure beat without full clarity on the causal mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; many lines do double work (e.g., "lanterns inside glowed like bottled comets" establishes atmosphere and hints at contained impossibility). Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("vows like rust," "bottled comets," "constellations as small, steady wounds"). However, density spikes into overwriting in several beats: "factually mystical, like proof disguised as rumor" and "shivering bliss, like someone stepping barefoot onto new snow" stack metaphors without clear grounding, and "feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed" borders on abstraction. Template cadence appears in the orchard-description paragraph ("Glass apples hummed...pear-shaped flasks whispered...clusters of gears blossomed"), where three parallel clauses flatten momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the figurative load in high-pressure beats (mask reveal, final choice) occasionally obscures rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and character motive. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer reflective lines contracting into shorter beats during visitor scenes. Minor loop: "broken-hearted" recurs three times, though the final use ("broken-hearted still, but tactfully hopeful") reweights rather than paraphrases. No template cadence, filter stacks, or metaphor muddle. The dust-as-photograph image is coherent and charged. Syntax and paragraph structure modulate with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "gum scraped off," "wet paper," "diluted metal," "stubborn memory." However, several beats lean into overwriting: "clouds stacked low" followed by "puddles gathered" and "dark, shallow mirrors" within three lines; "breathing dim auroras" is poetic but imprecise. Template cadence appears in the markets sequence: "Each stall… The vendors… That afternoon…" with repeated sentence openers. The phrase "coded freedom" recurs identically without transformation, creating a minor loop. Propulsion is generally strong, but the console exchange summarizes the memory deposit ("Street musicians… arguments… strangers") in list form rather than dramatizing one anchoring moment. No critical loops obscure closure, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level clarity is strong; sentences vary in length and rhythm supports scene needs (longer reflection in backstory, tighter beats at climax). Two penalties accumulate: (1) paraphrase loop in the backstory—"the room had heard it without understanding" and "afterward people left too quietly" restate the same vested-hush effect; (2) filter-verb stack in the grotto experiments ("he thought he could hear," "he wondered if," "he sensed") clusters in the middle third, dulling immediacy by ~0.5. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "stalactites weeping mineral tears" borders on decorative but does not obscure cause/effect. Opening and closing images are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across beats; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high (each monument, each leaf touch advances understanding). Weaknesses: several paraphrase loops—"sorted them not just by shape, but by the stories they whispered" echoes earlier sorting descriptions; "the monuments to forgotten things are how the valley remembers what it has not yet experienced" restates the alphabet concept without new pressure. Template cadence in monument descriptions (proverb/husks, letter/stems, word/seed) reads slightly mechanical. Final third avoids these patterns, so closure remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, mood, motive). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the descent and breathing in the greenhouse. Zero major loops. Minor friction: "uncertainly certain" appears twice in close proximity without added pressure; "the compass rose" is repeated as subject across multiple adjacent sentences in the cavern beat, creating mild template cadence. Figurative language ("vertical river of glass," "ribs") is precise and voice-coherent. The final image is crisp and propulsive. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm is strong and sentence openings vary; figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two accumulation issues prevent higher scoring: (a) paraphrase loop in the middle section—"promises did not melt" / "they corroded, clung, and changed" restates across two sentences without added pressure, and (b) elevated register in several high-pressure beats ("bordering on factually mystical," "projection that felt as precise as any ledger, terrible and tender") drifts slightly outside Eira's embodied lexicon. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies ("To the villagers she was a myth" / "To herself she was only a woman"), information density high (most lines advance image and pressure), figurative language controlled ("laughter caught in rusted wire fence," "gold mending a broken bowl"). Minor scaffold detected: "The sound came through" and "From its depths drifted" are near-synonymous openers in adjacent early paragraphs, and "one by one" / "each story surfaced" / "as each story" form a template run mid-closure that slightly dulls propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure causality but cost precision. Deduction: −0.6 in Q7 for paraphrase-loop and template cadence; artifacts do not touch the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "pewter mask strap broken, the metal coiled like a discarded question mark" establishes prop, image, and thematic motif). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the nauseous walk, longer syntactic arcs when parsing the proposition. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stained glass wounds," "gallows taught quantum ethics"). Two frictions lower the score: some metaphoric vehicles strain coherence ("anesthesia's gray fingers" is tactile; "ultraviolet leaves flashed brief equations" mixes light and math without clear linkage), and several sentences in the middle third use identical stems ("I reached... I realized... I pushed"), creating mild template cadence. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality, and the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in world-building passages. The phrase "anchors of intuition" appears four times, creating a motif rather than redundancy, but "overlooked histories" and cognates recur across six lines in the final third, edging toward paraphrase loop. "Elusively tangible sound" and "dense as a pocketed star" show figurative control, though "shed nails" and "hot as the air above the street lamps" mix registers slightly. No major clarity breaks, but the closing reflection summarizes rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances observation, ghost-world lore, or sensory detail without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at tension peaks, longer accumulative sentences during forensic analysis). Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence. Figurative language ("membrane instead of a switch," "entrails") is vivid and coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor quibble: "the way buildings learned to lie" risks slight abstraction, but it's anchored by prior concrete cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm is controlled and information density is high; figurative language ("fragile thunder," "condensed horizons") is purposeful but dense, appearing in most sentences of the climax without paraphrase loops. Minor scaffold: "He listened, nodded, and returned to the press, because eternity was still uncompressed" restates prior content. "Rustling awakenings" recurs as a label without evolving. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs that obscure causality; clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure creates visual rhythm. Strong figurative density ("time thickened around her fingertips, swirling in pale bands suspended like smoke in syrup") is mostly coherent but borders on overwriting in a few beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "pooled in corners like spilled years" and "collected inside mirrors" restate accumulation without added pressure. One template cadence run: "Elyas wrote of cities... Mara wrote of councils..." across two sentences. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and plot. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the mirror motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high ("midnight came like a stone dropped into ink," "rust bloomed like red moss," "light seeped along the rust") and mostly coherent, though "breathing cold" (iron doors) strains logic. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere and plot. Two minor loops: "listening for fractures" and "listened too" recur without added pressure, and "the city loosen[s] the breath it had forgotten holding" closely echoes "the Mayor's heart" earlier. Sentence openings vary, and proofreading is clean. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence variety supports rhythm: short declaratives at pressure points ("Then he clicks on his headlamp"), longer accumulative builds in description. High information density—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "its needle twitching slowly as if still arguing with some distant magnetic dream" = object state + metaphor + foreshadowing). Minor loop: "the smell of rain on rust, on asphalt, on old limestone, the odors that rise when the world changes its mind" echoes the opening petrichor description without adding pressure. One template-cadence run: "When the clouds finally rupture... When the vision spat him back... When he lays a hand..." across three key beats. Figurative language (lagoon as "dark mirror," stalactites as "teeth of a patient beast") remains coherent and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and most lines advance story or image ("sea hurled itself," "decades stacked like geological layers"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "perpetually learning" is stated, then rephrased ("broken sculptures and botched relationships"), and the archway's symbolic weight is restated three times in adjacent paragraphs ("not as the end of the road, but as the center of a map," "gatehouse that had forgotten which side was inside"). Template cadence in the reflection block ("Her work had always tried to scaffold…Here was that principle…") and filter-verb stacks ("felt less like," "as if," "She imagined") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is generally high. However, figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("thaw-water," "reluctant petals," "eyes after tears," "water through layered rock")—which slows momentum and risks overwriting, especially in the middle third where the glass mechanism is explained via summary rather than image. Several paraphrase loops appear: "If you want to know the night flowers, you must look through..." is restated in "The window from behind was different..." and again in "Night would tilt those shadows differently." Template cadence is present in the opening (multiple "He [verb]" stems). The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("understanding," "umbral tenderness") without concrete anchors, dulling the closure image slightly. Information density is uneven: some lines do multiple jobs, others repeat mood without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and syntax varied, with strong images ("dunes stretched…pale as exposed bone"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, figurative language saturates most sentences—metaphor in nearly every line—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure pressure. A few phrases loop conceptually: "retrocognitively trapped" is named but not mechanically demonstrated, and "the diary lightened…pages fluttering without wind" echoes prior mystical cues without advancing cause. The closing line is resonant, but mid-section beats occasionally prioritize texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong figurative control: "boats slept on the black water, hulls knocking softly like teeth," "working memory like pieces on a board," grief that "turned glass cloudy and calculations vague." Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates. Minor deductions: paraphrase loop in the middle third (the bottle's resistance to opening is restated across multiple adjacent lines without new pressure) and a few filter-verb stacks ("he had learned," "he had asked," "he had trained") that slightly dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat. Grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; figurative language serves mood and specificity ("fruit like muted lanterns," "voice speaking in a language so old it had petrified into ritual"). Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Two minor slips: "It had been a curious third-grade field trip in reverse" reads slightly exposition-forward, and "the word buried had knotted itself around Lan's heart and never left" edges into summary. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and propulsion holds through most beats. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line lands cleanly. Minor issues: a few paraphrase loops ("not grow, redistribute" / "borrowed time" recurs without adding pressure in adjacent lines) and one template-cadence run mid-scene ("They said... You mean... Not grow...") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language ("spiral seam," "tidal hush," "lattice of my own") enhances rather than obscures, though density approaches the high end in the memories passage without quite crossing into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph cuts create visual breathing, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He realized that if he erred on the side of noise today, no one would ever trust the hush again" compresses future consequence and present calculus). Two mild issues prevent higher score: the phrase "credibly curious" in paragraph 11 reads as scaffolding rather than dramatized trait, and "slow white rivers" in paragraph 15 is a stock metaphor. No paraphrase loops or template runs; figurative language remains sparse and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language—"meteors stitched white scars," "rivers of motion"—supports rather than obscures. Minor template cadence appears in several mid-story sentences beginning with "He [verb]" structures. A paraphrase loop occurs around "the station had once tracked...now the projections moved" and the subsequent reiteration of transformation. The final image is clean and propulsive. Overwriting check: figurative density in the middle third (nebulae dust, throat about to sing, molten silver threads) accumulates without muddling, but approaches saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent ("wind hissed… with a kind of mute eloquence," "colors pulsed like slow bees," "her voice weaving around my ears like smoke too tired to rise"). Minor issues: some paraphrase loops ("The covenant was tangled because their desires had been" echoes "Every unsent letter… glowed before me"), occasional metaphor density in reflective passages risks slowing momentum ("a bee that chose not to sting" is vivid but adds ornament at a contemplative beat), and a few phrases lean stock ("fogged mirrors," "dust motes into brief constellations"). No major artifact touching closure; beats remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character knowledge, or the central metaphor. Sentence openings vary purposefully. Minor scaffold detected: "After the calendars peeled..." and "When they dug it up..." are clean, but a few adjacent lines risk paraphrase (the fragment "seemed older" / "appeared suddenly timeless" could tighten). No loops in peak beats. Figurative density is controlled and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. The final paragraphs maintain propulsion and land the closure image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("threads bright and frayed," "door swinging inward on its own quiet hinge"). Information density is high. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "burnished hush" echoes "constant hush of waves"; "warmly attentive" appears twice in close proximity; "woven dawns" is described three times in similar terms. Template stems recur: "He [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences in the humming sequence. These artifacts appear in mid-story beats, not closure, so baseline −0.6 applied in Q7 only. No closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "veined with moss, hollow with architectural secrets" conveys history, mystery, and structure). Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings diverse. Minor loop: "He understood then" (paragraph 31) and "So he adjusted his plan" (paragraph 32) restate insight without added pressure—light paraphrase slip. Figurative language controlled but occasionally dense: "clock chiming underwater," "frozen moonlight," "graffiti," "subtitles" cluster in the first third without pattern-teaching, though they clarify at closure. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Grammar clean, tense stable, no pronoun drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image. Textural specificity strong ("cramped hand," "blinking lizards"). Propulsion consistent; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify, and figurative language (moss as handwriting, amber as ocher comma, homecoming as chain reaction) charges perception without overwriting most beats. Clarity and momentum hold. Two line-level issues lower the score: "bronze quiet" receives a three-part catalogue definition mid-text that stalls the beat, and the phrase "luminous skeptic" appears in both the third and ninth paragraphs, creating a paraphrase loop. The final paragraph compresses effectively ("rain steaming from my coat, fly amber cool in my hand"), but the mid-text definition and loop apply a −0.6 penalty in Q7 per the template and paraphrase-loop checks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene needs (longer for reflection, shorter for action). Minor scaffold appears in a few lines ("That was the sensation of these evenings, a narrow vastness"; "That was her submerged concord") where conceptual restatement slightly loops. No paraphrase chains or template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "narrow vastness" as both sensation and tone risks abstraction. Metaphors like "small ghosts inspecting the resumed business of the world" are fresh and legible. Zero pronoun confusion or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally with longer lines in the opening, shorter at peak beats ("She wore goggles…"; "Barrow whined, ears twitching"). Two minor issues: "intuitively descriptive stories from scents" is a strained construction that obscures sense, and the phrase "translate distance into closeness" recurs without fresh twist. One paraphrase loop: "distance was safer" and "distance only felt safer" in adjacent beats. No template cadence; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated. The final image lands cleanly with propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character stance, or thematic pressure simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with no algorithmic stems. Two minor artifacts: "confusion still clung" and "he had sworn to turn confusion into exploration" repeat the concept within three lines (paraphrase loop, −0.2), and the phrase "the one they called only when rules blurred" shifts into passive construction that slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, syntax propels without scaffold, figurative language is controlled (folded distance, closing eyelid shadow), and the final line lands with image rather than summary. No major loops or clarity breaks; the closure beat is untouched by line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is vivid ("clouds like torn pages," "sky overhead pulsed"). Information density is high. However, several lines loop or restate: "cautious abandon" appears twice with near-identical framing, "afraid and still climbing" echoes "embrace the unknown with open arms," and "wrongness of the sky" / "wrong sky" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions in the summit paragraph. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying −0.6 for loops and template cadence under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion and information density through most of the piece. Figurative language ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "morgue drawer for expendability") occasionally clusters without clear payoff, approaching overwriting in the middle third. A paraphrase loop appears: "what does a pawn become when it refuses promotion" is spelled with footsteps, then immediately answered by the dome's draft, then restated conceptually in the next paragraph—three adjacent moves circling the same idea. The final image—"routes of words only my feet could have written"—lands cleanly. No major scaffold or syntax monotony, but the figurative density in non-peak beats merits a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density; most lines layer image, action, and interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the unlock, longer accumulative waves during the stone's revelation). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor: slight overwriting in the opening third—"pages torn from granite," "books fluttering...like uneasy birds," "mercury-glass...reflecting me in a hundred shaken fragments"—clusters metaphor without sempre advancing pressure. The figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, but density in early beats approaches ornament. Closure beats are clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short bursts ("Solve it…Or fail") alternate with longer lyric accumulations. Information density is high: "war of gambits," "king toppled into blood," "exile followed" compress backstory into motion. Minor loop: "fidgets productively" in paragraph six echoes "fidgeting not from anxiety but from a fierce repose" in a later beat without added pressure; template cadence appears in two adjacent "He [verb]" constructions mid-piece. No mixed metaphors; figurative language (dust motes as pawns, tower as lightning bolt) remains coherent. Propulsion is strong through the winnowing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "their music was an innocently mischievous clatter" establishes tone, foreshadows method, and characterizes Zev). Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify. Minor deductions: "forged hush" recurs three times without escalating meaning, bordering on synonym loop. A few constructions lean slightly overwrought ("towers of bone rose... vertebrae and ribs fused into leaning spires that remembered") in early descriptive beats, nudging toward purple without breaking clarity. The final image is clean and propulsive. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but the density occasionally tips toward decorative in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("every step echoing like a question unanswered," short gasping line "When the trapdoor sealed above them, Corin collapsed"), and information density is high in the descent sequence. However, patterned phrases recur across many lines—"between breaths held underwater" (×3), "kintsugi intentions" (×3), "dire enchantment" (×2), "quilts memories together" (×2)—without additional pressure or detail each time, creating paraphrase loops. The formulaic "X, Y, and Z" opener appears in multiple paragraphs ("Vats of smoking emerald acid," "Around his neck hung," "On the central worktable lay"), and filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he thought," "he feared," "he believed"). Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and mild filter-stack (−0.3) yields cumulative deduction of ~−0.9 in Q7, with the artifacts touching but not obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in the cave sequence, and the prose integrates sensory detail with action cleanly. However, several adjacent lines loop conceptually—"promised to paint the place that did not yet exist, then make it real" / "hidden promise to myself" / "time for waiting was over" echo without added pressure—triggering a −0.4 paraphrase-loop penalty. A run of "I [verb]" stems in the middle third adds template cadence (−0.2). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally clusters densely without pattern payoff ("spiderweb fractures dividing yesterday from now" adjacent to "bottle thrown into an empty sea").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. Figurative language is generally strong ("mist slipped from the ocean like breath easing from a feverish chest"), though density is occasionally high in non-peak beats ("vibrations of intent that threaded quiet as spider silk through the world" followed immediately by more metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One minor register drift: "purifies intentions" in the scent's effect reads slightly elevated for the visceral moment. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, and spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cables droop like tired veins," "moon...steadies the trembling maps"). Information density is high with minimal scaffold. Friction: some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("voice...blurred at the edges, as if crossing an ocean of static"; "buoys...over trenches") and a few runs risk template cadence ("I do not remember, but my body does"; "We call it...but names are..."). The closure beat remains clear. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high, with lines often doing multiple jobs ("After the virus, that kind of defect made people feel safer"). The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the mirror motif with precise resonance. Minor issue: "excoriated the thin skin between selves" and "porous, flooded by the moods of strangers" are adjacent paraphrases that slightly loop the same concept. No other artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: most sentences do double duty (e.g., "his yellow slicker hanging open, a dried Edelweiss boutonnière pinned where a name tag should be" delivers costume, symbol, and professional absence simultaneously). Sentence variety supports rhythm without template cadence. Minor deduction: three instances of "softly persistent" across the story feel like synonym-dodge for a single idea, and "the peculiar sensation that someone invisible had stepped very close" leans toward stock phrasing. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding; propulsion is clean through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    句rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character (tactile memory of the chip), setting (petal ceiling, stone ledge), or pressure (warming water, brightening chip). No paraphrase loops detected. Minor friction: a few sentences lean slightly elevated ("exhaling pale pollen," "spinning constellations of color") in a passage otherwise grounded, though the register remains within the established lyric-realist voice. Filter verbs ("he heard," "he realized") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated. Propulsion is strong through the cavern sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong imagery ("ceremonial silks hissing like displeased snakes," "drop a white blur of cloud that swallowed sound and sense alike"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. No significant loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected. Minor issues: "cobalt grotto" vs. "ember grotto" creates a color confusion (both names appear for the same location); "the sky would bleed out" is slightly vague (bleed what? starlight? the phrase lacks a clear referent). The final beat ("Isera remembered") is abrupt summary, but clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, though occasional stacking risks overwriting: "small planets in improbable orbits" followed immediately by "unwilling to collide" adds a second vehicle without fresh pressure. "Scientifically romantic, half equation and half confession" leans toward label rather than dramatization. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor paraphrase loop: "The unofficial proposal is simply to capture..." immediately restates the official proposal's intent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: "the sharp green smell of sap in my throat, and the scrolls waiting" does triple work (sensory anchor, object presence, ritual implication). Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific: "frozen lightning," "fog with teeth," "pack of stray dogs," "dark comb on the mountain's scalp." No paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies: short during action ("I ran, naturally"), expansive during reflection. Minor deduction: "Getting jealous of past selves is not listed in the clinical literature, yet it is the method that keeps me awake at night" uses "yet it is" as filler; trimming to "yet keeps me awake" would tighten. One template stem: "I call it..." / "Out here they call it..." / "Chronologically confused is what the therapist... calls it"—three call-it constructions cluster early, creating mild cadence artifact (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies (short "It does" / long lyric builds). High density: "damp air rolled in like a quiet wave" advances mood and transition in one image. No loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "mapped emotional terrain" repeats across two sentences, and "trembling calm of ticking water" stacks modifiers. The closure beat is clean. Figurative language is coherent but dense—"river deltas," "constellations," "condensed...drop by drop"—approaching but not crossing the penalty threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances ritual, memory, or image. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating during rune-writing and breathing during framing. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("ink dragons," "shards of memory," "inkwell of weather"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines with similar stems ("Lan's first memory-shard rose... Shame had once burned... Now, in the saturated hush, he traced..."), but does not dull closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or logic errors.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is high ("Once it had belonged to Liora… Once Mirabel had turned that friendship into copy"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative density is elevated ("bark could pray," "words and feeding them back as metaphors") but mostly avoids muddle. One brief scaffold moment: "This is where imperfect miracles live" reads slightly authorial but is anchored in Mirabel's professional lens. The final image propels cleanly with no artifacting. Clarity and momentum hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. Minor issues: paraphrase loops appear ("He alone remembered the prior designs, the failed corrections, the truces that never held" restates earlier cosmological summaries without added pressure). Template cadence in the middle third: "The universe hiccuped once… Between two heartbeats… No-One felt…" Figurative language is frequent and sometimes stacked ("dust, stone, and the countless scrolls sleeping," "like shy animals," "like a breathing creature") without clear pattern-teaching. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well ("Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight; each number felt like a rung..."), and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two slips touch the high-pressure closure zone: "slash of water in pipes" (likely intended "hush," which appears later) creates brief confusion, and "they did not measure time itself but the rate at which attention surrendered" borders on abstract thesis-statement rather than image. The horizon's "soft-failed place" is evocative but the modifier stack in "with the uneasy sense that what he shepherded was not time but a flock of obedient illusions" flattens momentum slightly. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Penalizing for density near closure per the overwriting check.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory specificity is high ("mica pane shimmered between the flames and the dim fluorescent ceiling"). Information density is strong in beats like the note discovery and subway-scrawl accumulation. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: "I was supposed to be grading exams" / "the exams lay facedown" restates inaction, and "compulsive gambler" / "chased impossible odds with manic devotion" risks synonym churn. The final image ("scrubbed but not renewed, a little sad, clover bright") recharges opening motifs cleanly. Template cadence in reflective stretches ("He used it to justify risk; I used it to design safety nets") slightly dulls momentum, warranting −0.6 for patterned-artifact presence, but artifacts do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "the rising note threading into the line" advances tone and tactic). Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Demerits: mild overwriting in early figurative clusters ("night hovered between the hum of streetlamps, a thin electric pause that made the darkness feel held instead of simply vacant") and a few template cadences ("she spun it… until a tone rose"; "she listened… then said"). No loops touch closure, but cumulative minor artifacts in the first third prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. Figurative language pervades but remains coherent (paper bruises, memory as weight, gulls circling emptiness). Two frictions: "When context changes and the tide shifts its arguments" leans abstract without anchoring what changes; "tiny silhouettes of footsteps...each print a dark comma linking one heartbeat to another" stacks metaphors that blur the literal action. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the closure beat is clean. No paraphrase loops, though some sentences in the middle third ("I do not summon visions directly; that would be vulgar") edge toward scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language (ivy trembling "as if it heard a far train," "smile that apologized before anything bad happened") sharpens rather than obscures. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "technically not supposed to know each other" and "the air around them seemed to lean in" are stock constructions; "his smile was desperately jocular, like a joke told in a hospital corridor" stacks two vehicles for one tenor. The final summary beat ("heavier with every truth, until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared") tells the closure rather than dramatizing a specific moment, which flattens propulsion slightly. No loops or pronoun confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, pressure, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative phrases) without template cadence. Minor scaffold: "He believed that when the heavens stopped, the world below whispered its clearest directions" is slightly generic; "the phrase said only this: stay" borders on tell but serves closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("quiet blaze," "overlapping maps") is coherent and anchored. Proofreading clean; grammar stable. Peak beats (clearing, kneeling) maintain clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density; most lines do double work (e.g., "the anomaly hummed like a patient throat clearing" advances atmosphere and foreshadows speech). Rhythm varies purposefully. Minor template-cadence slip: "Here was… there the…" and "I still remembered… I also remembered…" cycle slightly in the revision sequence. One paraphrase loop: "threshing meaning from experience" rephrased as "listening not only outward but inward" without added pressure. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is mostly coherent; "kinder geometries" and "grain of possibility" work well.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and most lines multi-task (e.g., "breathing steam into the luminous harbor" anchors POV, setting, and interiority). However, several figurative constructions strain: "bowl of spilled stars," "underlining forgotten prayers," "music inside the quiet" cluster in the opening without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting (−0.4). "Whispering advisor arrived without footsteps, only the faint shift of air" is elegant compression, but the density of metaphor in early beats slightly dulls momentum before the signing sequence clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (setting, interiority, theme). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the well descent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the middle: "a volcanic tenderness rising without face or word" and "my chest cleave open with remorse and awe, as if my ribs were doors" layer metaphor densely in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching, though the register stays voice-coherent. One filter-verb run: "I saw," "I understood," "I felt" cluster in the climax paragraph but do not obscure causality. The final line—"adding to the trail for whoever came next"—closes with image and action. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance image, stakes, or realization. Figurative language is vivid but concentrated: "nerves into film," "knot of headphone wires," "auroral sorrow." However, several beats exhibit mild overwriting: "the hush of the universe inhaling before some cosmic verdict" stacks metaphors, and the passage "Stars overhead sharpened, every point a needle, and the auric lagoon brightened..." compresses too many effects into one breath. A few template cadences appear: "One memory rose... Another showed..." and "Her eyes looked out... When she lifted a hand, mine followed..." create parallel stems. No paraphrase loops, and the prose remains legible throughout, but the density of figurative language in the middle third occasionally slows momentum rather than sharpening it. Grammar and usage are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance both setting and character. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("He stepped," "He moved," "He whispered") but does not obscure causality. One brief paraphrase loop ("the maze itself was the lock" echoes in mechanics) costs −0.2. Figurative language ("ribbon of intention," "metal thicket") is controlled and apt. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm and sensory specificity are strong—"cobalt dock after rain," "dental mirror between his fingers," "flickering crescent moons." Several lines do double duty: "stillwater tension that pressed against ribs and thoughts" fuses setting and emotion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half-spoken secret" recurs in paragraphs four and fifteen almost verbatim without added pressure. Template cadence: "The guardian [verb]… They [verb]… The dentist [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs. Metaphor density is high—"buried memory surfacing," "voice trying to weave itself from shadow," "braiding with the soft slap of waves"—and while individually evocative, the cumulative effect in a 900-word piece (note: count appears to exceed 800) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching. Stock phrase: "heart rattling" is a minor cliché. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; several scaffold sentences ("From that night the guardian's watch turned into silent empathy") summarize rather than advance. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template cadence, −0.4 for metaphor density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is purposeful: "forests of second thoughts," "veined with iron," "words no one spoke aloud pressed against his ears." One template-cadence run appears in the setup ("They rustled… half-thoughts of… futures already surrendered") but does not obscure causality. The phrase "forests made of hesitations, reconsiderations, pauses long enough to stop a bulldozer" stacks near-synonyms, costing −0.3. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No loops or scaffold that dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm and clarity are strong through most beats: "the harbor lamps shrank behind them," "a cage lined with cushions is still a cage." The final paragraph stacks three clauses without causal linkage ("pressed the cool whalebone… expecting silence… felt the harbor rise… She knew her only wish"), creating a summary cluster where scene pressure should land, applying −0.4 for closure-beat loop and summary pivot. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "drowned banners" and "purple light down into its throat" work. Minor paraphrase: "violence becomes impossible" repeated across two paragraphs without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; figurative density is high but controlled ("pale, turning skeletons," "slow comet," "saga Mara had not asked for"). Sentence openings diversify. Minor artifacts: "Outside, the turbines..." recurs as structural filler; "The performer decided..." tells a turn better shown. Paraphrase near end: "It was not happiness...she let it stay" loops concept without added pressure. Clarity and momentum hold; no closure-scene harm.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. Sentence openings vary ("After the ban lifts," "The first to step," "He moves," "Inside," "Each pillar") and rhythm modulates with scene pressure, tightening at the dais and opening during the stride. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and voice-motivated, though occasional stacking ("throat of stone, ribs of humming quartz colonnade") approaches overwriting without quite crossing into opacity. Minor template cadence appears in mid-section constructions ("He tells them," "He asks," "He steps"), but these do not loop or obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final line ("simply, a man allowed to stride through boundaries that were never sacred, only afraid") resolves through image and recharges the boundary motif with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and image-dense: "Ash still glowed in the seams between cobblestones, sketching trembling constellations beneath Mira's bare, paint-splattered feet." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor artifacts: "She could not name colors, but she could feel when a painting almost apologized for existing" reads slightly ornamental; "the glassblower had gone inside to sleep off a night of shaping molten birds that would never burn out" is a beautiful image but momentarily stalls momentum. Two adjacent sentences in the stranger's entrance paragraph restate his arrival without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the phoenix-description opening but does not pervade. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loop, −0.2 for minor ornamental drift in one beat. Closure beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening "chime after the blackout was almost too soft to hear" anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop present: "What if the bells were not a path but a mirror" and "What if her role was not to lead them, but to be led" are adjacent parallel constructions that restate rather than advance; applies −0.2 per the paraphrase-loop check. One figurative phrase ("color shivered over its surface like water trying to remember being rain") is striking but borders on overwriting in a quieter beat. Closure image is clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "long cascading curtains of intention...equations calculating light paths, prayers describing futures nobody believed they deserved" does multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops detected. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("mourning jewelry maker exiled among instruments of light," "pinned, a small specimen") feels slightly ornamental before the apparatus is revealed, but the payoff at closure justifies setup. The final beat "rock bottom was only a temporary floor" lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is fresh ("cables dangled like ivy," "water beaded and traveled the glass like cautious comets," "tiny figures toppled without parachutes"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor scaffolding appears: "She called it reverse engineering belief, teasing structure from the scattered data of human desire" and the subsequent line both describe the project in adjacent sentences without added pressure. The phrase "a black lattice of streets folding into a spiral staircase" is vivid but edges toward overwriting in a reflective beat. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image propels cleanly. The prose is strong but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "light broke apart into drifting atoms of nostalgia," "innocence flake away, layer by layer, not lost but refined, like ore smelted." While vivid, the metaphoric load in consecutive sentences across multiple beats risks overwriting. Paraphrase appears: "anguished joy" recurs as both phrase and concept; "steadily unpredictable" is illustrated but then restated. Template cadence is minimal, and propulsion is maintained. Clarity at closure holds, so penalties remain moderate, but the piece would benefit from selective pruning of figurative language in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("sky bruised violet," "parchment wings," "luminous regret"), though density approaches the high end in the opening third without obscuring clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold remains in phrases like "as if sensing" and "as if some brightness," but these are voice-motivated and do not dull the closure beat. Sentence openings vary, and the final line propels forward with clear image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor overwriting in the backstory block ("fragile convictions...brittle where they touched hunger and hope") edges into elevated metaphor density without pattern-teaching, but the closure beat is clean. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, world rules, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (compressed plant dialogue, longer reflective beats). "Closure seeker who opens wounds" and "key, not a lock" work as character-specific metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions ("I tell people... But you cannot close...") and one near-loop ("show me" → immediate plant response could tighten). No figurative muddle in peak beats. The hourglass description and coffee-ring mechanics carry visual clarity without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "hushed thunder" recurs three times, similes stack ("like a rosary," "like a reel clicking into place," "with the force of a held-back storm"), and metaphors occasionally contradict (a building "hums" yet is silent, "hushed thunder" mixes registers). Template cadence appears in paired modifiers ("dust, hot metal, and slept-through matinees"). Paraphrase loop: "unused love" and "unsent love" alternate without added pressure. Information density is strong and propulsion steady, but overwriting patterns accumulate across beats. Deduction: −0.8 for density and coherence issues in non-closure beats; −0.3 for paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors: "muffled sighs," "wavering light," "bruised green," "narrow map," "slow needles of fire," "shadowed rapture" cluster without always advancing pressure. "Careful bruise" and "shadowed rapture" verge on mixed vehicles but remain evocative. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is strong. Sentence openings vary. The closure image is clear despite the lyric register. One small deduction for metaphor density in middle beats that could tighten without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and stake without padding. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Minor deductions: "I crouch and cup my hands around them, frightened they will burn out before choosing a direction" repeats the cupping gesture described earlier. The phrase "Someone must" appears twice in adjacent lines, creating a brief paraphrase loop. "Wave functions" recurs multiple times but remains slightly abstract—its mechanics are asserted more than dramatized. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.4 total.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loop between "I closed my eyes and tried to orient myself by sound" and the subsequent navigation description, but it does not obscure causality. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("sweater beginning to unravel from one stolen stitch"). One weak filter-verb run in the middle third ("I realized," "I did not know," "I felt") that slightly dulls immediacy. No scaffolding or template cadence; clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, the piece carries moderate overwriting: figurative density in the opening and guide-dialogue beats ("like a breath not yet decided," "a tide-line curve etched by many midnights," "through darkness that thinned not by lamps but by memory") without strict pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor in "the leash around her chest had snapped" (leash as internal tether, then physical constraint) and repetitive "she saw" stems in the stairway sequence. Information density is generally high, but the elevated register in peak beats (the stairway, the final hum) dilutes immediacy. Apply −0.6 for density and stem repetition in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong figurative density ("ribs bending like bad questions," "words feathering the air," "snow falling in a steel drum") charges the lyric register without obscuring causality. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple layers (world, character, pressure). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at closure. Minor deductions: a few paraphrase loops in the middle third—"My training screamed to escort her in silence, but curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me" restates the conflict already shown through the head-tilt gesture. "Seraphically mundane" recurs without functional reweighting. Template cadence appears in "I thought of the guests… I thought of the piano," creating slight scaffold drag. These issues do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.4 to −0.6 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances setting, character work, or thematic layering. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative lines ("So he seeded more messages...") alternating with tighter images ("He watched..."). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. However, figurative density is very high throughout—"ribs of stone arching above like the cage of a fossilized sky," "stars hung like thoughts someone had forgotten to finish"—and while striking, this level of metaphor in nearly every line risks tipping into overwriting. The metaphors remain coherent and avoid mixed vehicles, but the cumulative weight slightly slows momentum in the middle third. Clarity at closure remains strong, so the density doesn't obscure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or the central mystery. Syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language ("tired lung," "storms grew teeth," "spared teeth") is coherent and voice-consistent. Minor slips: "delayed revelation sit inside me like a swallowed stone" uses a filter construction that slightly dulls immediacy, and "drifting moored above paths" at the very end risks mixed metaphor (drifting vs. moored). No loops or scaffold; rhythm propels throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical templates. Information density is high in the closure sequence (stones singing, images flickering, fear folding into a question, trembling fingers, the wrist-comm line). Figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every paragraph carries metaphor or elevated diction—but remains coherent and voice-consistent for a character framed as "barefoot stargazer." Two areas dock the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the rebellion-history passage ("loud as rocket fire" / "three molten days" / "simmered under curfew" all describe the same temporal arc without advancing new stakes), and (2) the phrase "thunderous serenity" arrives late as a tonal claim rather than dramatized sensation, reading more like prompt fulfillment than organic beat. No grammar errors; spatial choreography is clear. Propulsion is steady, though the middle third's reflective density slightly slows momentum before the stones-and-send sequence accelerates.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure). The metaphor "steam ladders curled up from the sulfur pools, painting ghost ribs against the blackened mountains" is vivid and coherent. Minor loop: "Before the volcano cracked the academy vaults, the council scientists had bred children whose lives came pre-written in their cells. They called it guidance; my grandmother called it shackles..." includes a paraphrase beat (pre-written/guidance/shackles) that slightly flattens momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythms vary purposefully (short declaratives during the freeze response, longer accretions when cataloging truths), and information density is high—most lines do double work. The fig/henna parallel, lighthouse/body-reaching motif, and pearl image recur with reweighted meaning rather than mere repetition. Two frictions: "listening to the glass roof ping as the fog condensed" and "the ocean kept its own counsel" verge on minor overwriting, and the phrase "a thin armor against chaos" feels slightly elevated for the moment. The closing paragraph maintains propulsion without scaffolding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful in many beats ("dust with a luminescent ache," "hinges twisted like something that had drowned"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "fragmented reality" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure, and the rhetorical-question stem recurs mechanically in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence is visible in the middle third: "Here was the Tower... here the Lovers... here Death" reads as list structure rather than propulsion. Several sentences open with "He" or "The" in runs, flattening rhythm. The closure paragraph mixes registers—"possible selves, each one a card returning to its box" is vivid, but the final question adds a lyric gloss that dilutes rather than charges. Information density is solid overall, but scaffold and synonym churn (fragmented/fractured, redesign/rearrange/reassign) lower momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery: "dense as obsidian," "wind keened," "anger flare, steady and bright." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Two minor frictions: "Again, time had stretched" opens a reflective block that paraphrases the demonstration to come, creating slight redundancy; "the oldest said" / "the elder murmured" / "the elder answered" in quick succession leans on similar tag stems. Figurative density is high but controlled, and no loops or scaffolding obscure the closure beat. Information density is strong across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines advancing character, world, or stakes. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("perfume of dust and shattered promises," "frozen rivers") risks overwriting but stays coherent. Minor template cadence in the series of "If she…" conditionals near the end, though the parallelism serves the deliberative moment. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The final image "the snow listening above" lands cleanly. A few phrases ("blink that follows surprise," "practiced amnesia") edge toward stock metaphor but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding mar the text. Figurative language is vivid and controlled ("roses that never stopped drinking light," "debt she carried...as if it weighed as much as an airship") without overwriting. However, several beats edge toward summary where scene would sharpen: "Some laughed...others listened despite themselves" tells rather than shows the hunters' reactions, and "struck by a grief they could not name" abstracts the raiders' experience. These summary moments prevent entry into the 8+ band, where immediate scene pressure would dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, mythology, or internal state. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the voicing-silence beat, longer accumulative flows in the garden description) and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("constellations shuffling their stars like hands fumbling through dark pockets"). One friction: "the echo of a goddess" and "the goddess's echo" appear in consecutive early paragraphs, a mild synonym cycle. Minor overwriting in "bright, searing shapes that skittered across his inner sight"—three modifiers in peak beat—but it does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively (short declarations during the proof, longer lyric sentences for observatory description). Information density is high with most lines doing double work. Minor loop: "observant as ever, devotedly observant" is a small synonym echo. The metaphor density is controlled but occasionally tips toward the decorative ("clouds have climbed from the sea, swallowing skyscrapers in a patient, murmuring gray" front-loads lyricism before stakes land). No scaffold or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean. The opening and closing images both anchor stakes and voice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (long lyric openings, terse action beats), and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("air tastes like dusted vinyl," "hands shaking as if the meteors are dragging my bones toward the sky"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("the firmware feeds on anything old" / "the firmware has found a new frequency" / "the haunted firmware goes very quiet" recycle the same noun-phrase stem across beats) and stacked filter constructions ("I could still hear it," "I instinctively map," "I know instantly") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. The loops don't obscure causality but reduce propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening and closing images anchor stakes and recharge motifs effectively. However, mild overwriting appears in the first third: "breathed a soft, lilac unease that gnawed at the edges of sound" stacks modifiers without causal urgency, and several adjacent sentences in the pilgrims' description loop similar content ("ringed the central pit," "Mist coiled between them, smudging faces," "making every profile look half-erased"). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the penalty to −0.8, but they prevent entry to the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and often does double duty (e.g., "steel arms…catching fractured sunlight" ties setting to theme). However, line-level artifacts cluster in mid-story: paraphrase loops ("the fire had been a teacher, not a tyrant" / "she named the sky fractured, not shattered") and template cadence ("She saw…She saw…She saw") across three consecutive beats in the tessera vision sequence. Stock metaphor "mosaics burning blue and gold" and the phrase "warm coldness" (repeated twice) slightly dull specificity. Final image is clean, but mid-story scaffold reduces density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "figure made of footlights and dust motes," "echoes from palms that shattered light like cymbals," "taste burnt sugar and hear it as violet shards clicking together." In the orchard encounter, metaphor stacks without pause (violet shards, pale blue gust, bronze and dark orange chord, green-gold ascending scale), risking coherence under peak pressure. Template cadence appears in the backstory cluster: "She had painted... she had made... she thought... now she knew" across adjacent lines. The coin's mechanics (wheel with gears, amber hope flashing through branches) blend concrete and abstract without always clarifying which is literal. Information density is strong, but the figurative load in the final third approaches ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, a paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "Lines of light unfurled…threads looping" restates the web-of-connections image across adjacent sentences without adding pressure. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("He felt…He turned…He reached") creates a brief drumbeat that flattens momentum. One stock metaphor ("cobwebs of possible choices") slightly dilutes the otherwise fresh sensory palette. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or thematic layering without padding. Rhythm modulates well from measured descent to the charged stillness of the pool. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "The hues here were faint…Those villagers had left…I am not a machine" follows a similar declarative stem pattern across three beats, mildly flattening momentum (−0.3). The metaphor "ceiling arched like the ribs of an ancient whale" is vivid and voice-consistent, though "silver nerves" for the lantern's lattice risks slight anatomical muddle without harming clarity. No loops or paraphrase chains touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or pressure. Figurative language ("slow constellations," "trapped sunsets," "unearthed silence") is vivid and coherent, concentrated in scene-setting rather than overwhelming peak beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm breathes. Minor artifacts: "quietly inspired" (penultimate paragraph) leans toward label-only trait naming, and "the truth unravels in whispered alleys Mara tried not to imagine" mid-story introduces a syntactic hiccup (comma splice or awkward embedding). The phrase "as the truth unravels" recurs as a timeframe marker but does not loop—it reweights. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Proofreading is clean. Strategic telling compresses Mara's years of preparation efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled: "mechanical whale," "silver hush," "glinted faintly through the mist." Minor issue: a few adjacent sentences loop conceptually without adding pressure—e.g., the two pillbox-description beats in quick succession feel slightly redundant. The final image propels cleanly. No template cadence, filter-verb stacks, or clarity lapses. Sentence openings vary. One small paraphrase loop (handlers/Bureau/headquarters) lowers density slightly but does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is concentrated but coherent ("living palimpsest," "erasure," "spindrift serenity"). Minor friction: "etched in him from other nights" and "layered in him" are near-synonyms within two paragraphs, and "the way a reader lifts his head at the turn of a page" is slightly self-conscious meta-commentary. Clarity and propulsion hold; no loops or scaffolding. The final image recharges motifs (bank, page, listening) without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance image, character stance, or thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer contemplative sentences giving way to shorter declaratives in the planting sequence. Two minor issues prevent higher scoring: "by following sun patterns" repeats across paragraphs 8 and 14 without added pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2), and "fractured timelines" is named three times in close succession (paragraphs 9–10) where once would suffice (template cadence, −0.3). No loops touch the closure beat, so non-closure cap applies. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the oasis image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but largely coherent ("blade of moonlight," "alley's throat," "low-slung constellation"). Two clusters merit attention: "quivering hush" appears twice in identical phrasing without reweighting, a paraphrase loop. The phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" is used twice—once as backstory anchor, once as present action—but feels slightly forced on the second use. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun]," though the effect does not obscure causality. Information density is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Proofreading is clean. The accumulation of loops and stems in non-closure beats warrants a −0.5 deduction in this category only.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "They had come here to translate isolation into independence, to turn solitude into something inhabitable" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Lio [verb]," creating rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphor: "brittle awakenings" recurs three times without evolving. Filter-verb stack in reflection beats: "Lio recognized," "Lio watched," "Lio saw" flatten immediacy. The "atomically reflective" description is vivid but borders on overwriting when paired with "impossibly clean shine" and "mirroring not just light but the arrangement of time itself." Artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template runs, though they do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the scene's reflective tempo. Minor deductions: "I feel all those unsentences stir, restless as birds in winter reed" mixes metaphors (unsentences as birds, then reeds), and "twig spiral" recurs without added pressure in one instance. A brief filter-verb cluster ("I feel," "I understand") appears mid-scene but does not pervade or flatten immediacy. The final image is clear and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clarity and concision hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies: short bursts during the broadcast ("She toggled," "The meters twitched") alternate with longer contextual lines. Minor loop: "subsonic frequencies" appears three times in close succession without varied function, and "signal" recurs frequently in the opening third without reweighting. One paraphrase: "the Void signal had changed" and "New pulses rode beneath" restate proximity. No filter-verb stack clusters in peak beats; clarity holds. The final line propels with image rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density ("starlight stitched," "dewless sheen," "compressed midnight") mostly serves atmosphere without overloading. Information density high: most lines advance setting, character state, or choice. Two friction points: "He did not know whether the temple resented... or welcomed" offers synonym pairing without added pressure (−0.3). "Negotiating with the skittish stones" in high-pressure beat drifts slightly precious (−0.2). Sentence openings vary; no major loops. Clarity sustained through complex spatial choreography. Propulsion strong to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high (grid-work, ribbon fragment, visitor hand-hovering) and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening ("mist rose...curling like breath") and closing ("stone slipped") frame the piece cleanly. Two areas lower the score: (1) mild paraphrase loops—"methodical" appears three times in similar constructions ("He was very methodical," "very methodical even in that"), and "furrowed hush" recurs identically without reweighting; (2) one mixed metaphor—"lance the armored hide of a conscience that had grown comfortable in the dark" conflates surgical precision with animal hide and spatial comfort. These touch non-closure beats; the final image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "the bunk foam drank it in with a slow, spongey dread" conveys setting, sensory detail, and emotional charge). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: "drowned lungs," "guilty masts," "wet rag." Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the nail motif. Clarity is high; no loops or scaffold. Minor deductions: "slant rhymes about currents that walked and winds that slept" is evocative but edges toward ornament without clear payoff; "nervously confident" and "the dread inside her had taken on a purpose" are slightly abstract labels where embodied action would sharpen. "Sickening precision" in the coordinates line is a small tell-don't-show moment. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies well across long lyric sentences and short declarative beats ("Silence pools around him, bright and stunned"). Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "He plays the apology he never voiced" advances plot and character). Minor density slip: "Beyond the pullout, a highway overpass is under repair, and a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" front-loads two noun phrases that momentarily stall momentum before "flutters" arrives. One paraphrase loop: "Each fragment absolves a single moment" / "erasing the hitchhiker from one intersection of fate" restates across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks, template cadence, or scaffold loops. Clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per line: "Maybe some paths circle back because we mistake inheritance for destiny, polishing the same old hunger until it passes for vision." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the startup recap and breathing in the final tableau. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor lift: the phrase "polished calm" recurs three times across the piece (floor dust, Lila's demeanor, final paragraph), which borders on decorative echo but serves the conceptual repricing at closure. No figurative muddle or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("dreams would not leave me alone," "the sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page," "variable stars…like breathing written in light") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed registers appear ("midnight solace" reads elevated against the grounded observatory work). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "I unfolded…I copied…Aria overlaid" creates a three-step list rhythm. The closure sentence "I finally witnessed my own healing" shifts into summary-tell that undercuts the image-driven momentum built prior. No loops or pronoun drift; information density is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual texture. Information density is high—most lines advance image, character decision, or world logic. Clarity is strong except for one brief muddle: "breath came in slow, warlike serenity, each inhale a truce, each exhale a declaration of quiet siege" stacks metaphors that nearly contradict (truce vs. siege) but recover through context. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few figurative strings approach overwriting in the first third ("glassy and sharp as broken promises," "spectral branches like forgotten fruit"), but they remain legible and purposeful. Grammar and tense are consistent. The final line is clean and resonant. Penalty: −0.4 for minor figurative density in setup that does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "sky made to the soil," "moth learning the language of flame," "waves braided with hedges." Two vehicles strain credibility—trains folding like paper cranes feels more whimsical than the established tone, and "waves braided with hedges" mixes incompatible textures. Template cadence appears in the vision catalog: "I saw cities... I saw the hedge... At its center..." runs four parallel constructions without variation. Minor filter-verb stack in "I said within the shared silence" and "or thought, or bled into him." Information density is strong; most lines advance image and implication. No paraphrase loops, and the final line lands with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots trammel," "moth-eaten soul," "air tasted like rust"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor deductions: "fiercely gentle" appears twice in close proximity without adding pressure. The phrase "dusky resolve made visible" reads abstract and slightly strained. "Someone long ago had carved channels" and "inlaying meaning everywhere with silver dust" lean toward telling when showing would tighten. The final paragraph compresses key sensory detail ("smelled faintly of river water") that could anchor more strongly. No major loops or scaffold, but a few near-paraphrases ("I had been looking away...when I turned back he was gone" / "my hands empty, the water thick and fast") repeat the same event without added detail.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; sentences layer appraisal detail, memory, and metaphor without major redundancy. Rhythm varies—longer reflective passages contract to short beats at the scrap discovery. Minor template cadence in the backstory paragraphs: several "After…" and "Once…" stems cluster without variation. The phrase "the quiet had been louder than any crowd" borders on stock paradox but serves the theme. No major loops or scaffold, though the reflection-heavy middle risks slight momentum drag. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance image, character, and thematic weight simultaneously. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Small deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds Mara's established register under peak stress ("luminous vines that rooted in the sky itself" reads more authorial than character-filtered) and one near-paraphrase in the arbor's offering sequence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "moonlight thickens; it always does when the moon is missing" establishes world logic and tone simultaneously). Rhythm modulates well from lyric description to the fisherman's arrival to the smelting climax. Template-cadence check: several paragraph openings use similar declarative structures ("I know what I must do," "I recognize the panic," "I invite him to sit") across the middle third, creating mild formulaic drag (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The figurative language is dense ("metal of them glows," "startled minnows") but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "metal of them glows evenly within my chest's furnace gears" slightly conflates molten state with mechanical operation, though context clarifies intent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance setting, character stance, or thematic resonance. The opening's latent radiance image recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. However, minor scaffold persists: "acquired abandoned hopes, layer by quiet layer" paraphrases "the thing the bunkers acquired and hoarded" from two lines prior, and "listening not for fault lines or structural failure, but for the quiver in her own voice" over-explains an inference the prior imagery has already earned. Figurative language in the final third (crown, ghost-light, sealed corridors, reopening) layers without teaching a pattern, reducing propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; openings shift; information density is high (most lines advance image, memory, or stance). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is mostly purposeful: "guilt travels quieter than any train," "silver scales holding together a lung that refused to quit." Minor overwriting appears in one extended simile cluster mid-story ("The memory came not as image but as geography, a map unrolling across my ribs") where three consecutive lines employ the map metaphor without added pressure—density without propulsion. The closure paragraph is clean and propulsive. Grammar and tense are consistent; pronoun references unambiguous. One small register drift: "raw solace" in the graffiti description reads slightly elevated against the otherwise embodied voice, though it's brief and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled ("mist rolled past like shy spectators," "dragging chains across the carpet of the air"). Weakness: several lines stack modifiers and lyric constructions in quick succession without peak-beat justification ("cautious exuberance prickling beneath her ribs, equal parts dread and delight at finally touching the rumor"), creating mild density clutter. The final beat is clean, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("sky refused to melt," "sequins to a dress that had outlived its dancer"). However, several high-pressure beats carry mixed or strained metaphors: "contract folded like a paper guillotine" (guillotines don't fold), "his voice a practiced tenderness, the mulberry ache of a man who collects other peoples longing" (vehicle shifts mid-phrase from tenderness to ache to collector). Minor paraphrase loop: "I thought of the empire... I thought of my own life" uses identical stems without added pressure. These artifacts appear in mid-story beats, not closure, so deduction is moderate (−0.8 for figurative muddle, −0.2 for stem repetition).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and the prose propels forward without scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and motivated ("the grotto hung like a stone lantern," "their shared stillness hummed like a taut, invisible wire"), with no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor density slips appear in the extended setup (parallel descriptions of skyfarers trend toward template cadence: "one old captain's face…another's, scarred and stern"), and a few filter verbs ("she had trained herself," "she recognized") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The final image is clean and resonant, with no artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance image, memory, or thematic weight. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor issues: paraphrase loops in the vision sequence ("On one branch… On another…") create template cadence across three lines, and a few stock metaphors ("clear as rain," "bright, pulsing center") reduce specificity. The figurative density in the grotto interior (light as water, smoke as foliage, trees of lived moments) occasionally blurs propulsion, though it remains legible. No major scaffold or pronoun drift; proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines do two jobs). The opening clause "By the time the campfire's last spark dies, my real work begins" anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minor paraphrase loop in the chime passage: "deciphering wind chime selections like lines of hesitant script" followed immediately by "I close my eyes and translate their scattered ringing" restates method without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density in early paragraphs (glass, edges, vulnerability, hook, mirror, tongues) risks overwriting but remains voice-coherent and does not obscure causality. No template cadence or major artifact in the closure beat, but the loop and metaphor clustering cap this at upper 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with the trance ("Minutes or hours later, she could not say"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting appears in the opening third: "the magnetic grotto under starlight hummed softly beneath," "trading a continuous sycamore hush," and "tone itself were study" lean elevated without clear voice motivation. The stone-drop sequence is clean and propulsive. No loops or template cadence. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "like ink washed again and again" and "folded itself into the lesson like another ring" cluster without pattern-teaching, triggering a −0.3 deduction for density.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and the mapping conceit simultaneously ("He chose seven stones, each a different tone when struck, and laid them in a small crescent before the arrowhead"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the stone-skimming sequence and breathing during reflection. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" openings across four consecutive sentences, costing −0.4. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat, and the final image ("every echo a coordinate, every silence a path") delivers high specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, interiority, or pressure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates through the ascent without sluggishness. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful: "frozen question mark," "thoughts curled up like burned paper," "textured vapor threaded with quiet light." Minor slip: "the air around his boots thickened into mist, not the blank, white kind that erased horizons but a textured vapor threaded with quiet light" extends the metaphor slightly but remains legible and voice-coherent. Grammar and punctuation are clean; pronoun references clear. Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line resolves by action that recharges prior motifs (mist, impossibility, the boundaries).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the library sequence, where each image does double duty (atmosphere + stakes). However, several adjacent lines loop conceptually: "Each book leaked a soft radiance… lines of text lifting free as drifting ribbons of pale, silent light. He recognized them not as stories, but as luminous vows…" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Elias… moved… He worked… Elias hid…"). Figurative language saturates most sentences in the underwater beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows rather than propels. No clarity break at closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loops, template stems) trigger −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high throughout: most lines advance multiple elements (character, atmosphere, concept). Rhythm modulates appropriately—longer contemplative sentences during coin-reading, shorter syntax at the tuning choice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor ding for one phrase bordering on stock: "the universe were groping for my outline" feels slightly generic compared to the otherwise precise figurative language. The opening and closing images bookend effectively: "ambered observatory deck" recurs as the spatial constant while action transforms. Sentence openings vary; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; sentences multi-task (e.g., "He believed that the echo of sacrifice still rang in every trembling heartbeat, asking quietly to be translated" advances motive, theme, and stakes). Rhythm varies naturally; no runs of identical stems. Minor slip: "He had come back for one reason only" is scaffold that the next line already conveys. A few near-paraphrases ("voices that no living throat remembered" / "echoes forgotten phrases") slightly dull propulsion but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies sentence by sentence; openings shift naturally. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Figurative language is controlled ("arches...a rib of stone," "bracket jutted like an empty throat") and purposeful, though "brittle devotion...baked thin" and "naivete had teeth" cluster in one paragraph, edging toward density. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion is smooth. Minor artifact: "the peculiar gift that every examiner had politely called useless" is slightly expository mid-passage, and "Steam rose from her cuffs, not from power, but from last nights rain" (missing apostrophe) is a copy slip. Overall clarity and concision are strong, with no line-level drag touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information density is high: "vigilant by habit and by grief," "broken rooftops breached the surface, chimneys poked out like gray fingers" compress backstory and setting into action-driven lines. Rhythm varies naturally without template cadence. Minor slip: "The label in his hand smelled of river rot, but the color was unabashed, a small defiance of drowning" stacks two appositives in quick succession, creating brief density overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; clarity and propulsion remain strong through the photograph trail and final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, and individual images are vivid ("frost grow fernlike," "ink dropped into wind"), but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without breathing room: "Mist breathed," "mountain itself were dreaming," "eyes weighed the world like scales," "Trees arched... like equations," "every blossom a variable." In the climactic beat, metaphor density continues unabated ("Light dove from sky to pool to glass to crystal, catching the ring of flame so that fire itself seemed to turn liquid and cool"), muddling the physical action. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He had spent decades proving her wrong... Now the orchard's breathing hush..."). No paraphrase loops or major grammar breaks, but the overwriting dulls propulsion at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with strong propulsion—most lines do multiple jobs (establish world, advance choice, charge imagery). Rhythm varies purposefully, opening with short declaratives then expanding under reflection. Minor template cadence in middle third: three consecutive "I [verb]" constructions during the recording beat create slight monotony. Figurative language mostly purposeful ("stone dropped into an unseen sea," "salt white wounds") though "contrails" carries coordinates feels slightly forced for lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high in the duel beats. However, three artifact patterns accumulate: (1) template cadence in the opening third ("Wind curled… carrying," "I stood… masquerading," "After my mind… feelings"), (2) filter-verb stack ("I watched, feeling almost nothing," "I realized I did not want"), and (3) elevated metaphor density without pattern-teaching ("motives twitching," "algorithmic compost," "recursive appeals," "stubborn annotation") that occasionally obscures rather than sharpens. The closure beat ("wait, I said, lowering my weapon") is clean and propulsive. Artifacts in the first half and filter verbs prevent higher scoring but do not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with strong propulsion: "sighing furnace," "silence settled like limescale," "phantom laughter...streams up through nail holes and mouse runs." Figurative language saturates most sentences, occasionally crowding clarity—"the unspoken half still hangs here, raw as an unfinished chord" followed immediately by "tending to the unspoken, rehearsing conversations...by sweeping leaves into sentences" risks metaphor pile-up. Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "once in sound and once in memory," "half sob and half giggle," "cracked open instead of sealing shut." No paraphrase loops; information density is high. The closure beat—"the air holds the shape of a smile"—lands cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance metaphor, atmosphere, and stance simultaneously. However, mild figurative density in the middle third (ember flickering "as if breathing," boundaries "pacing," light "discovering it is also a cage") risks overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final line ("waiting, uncertain, almost kind") delivers propulsion and thematic closure cleanly, but the mid-story metaphor stacking slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across the arc. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He had broken more beakers than he remembered, not from clumsiness but from abandoning experiments the moment they unsettled anyone important" advances backstory, character flaw, and motive). No paraphrase loops; figurative language is concentrated but coherent ("frozen bloom," "penny drops," "cathedral exhaling"). Minor drag in mid-section reflective blocks slightly flattens momentum before the climax, and one near-cliché ("his heart a percussion of doubt") doesn't obscure but trends generic. Final line ("carrying no title, only the knowledge that tomorrow, someone would quietly choose otherwise") recharges the opening's "failure like another cracked vial" with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do two jobs), and figurative language is precise without muddle: "moon swelled like a silver lantern," "rust drifted...like exhausted confetti." The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the recursive-ending motif with cost. Deductions: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs explaining the shard of hush and hollywood fragment (both "taught me" constructions feel templated), and one scaffold moment ("That was what I had always chased") that restates theme rather than advancing pressure. Runs of "I [verb]" stems across the middle third approach template cadence without quite triggering the −0.4 threshold, but the cumulative effect slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The horn blew, low and ancient, and the city lights drew backward like a curtain"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "He stepped out on deck, resiliently positive despite..." and "Even when no one laughed, he kept talking" restate his cheerfulness without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("fog...thickening not from water but from unsaid possibilities"). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines doing double work. Minor density concerns: "unsettling calm" recurs three times without reweighting, and "the architect murmured" is a slightly weak tag. The figurative language is mostly coherent ("sinew thread, pale and lustrous like something salvaged from the inside of lightning") though "transparent ribs" for overlapping doorways strains slightly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Propulsion is strong through the weaving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer description with interiority and stake advancement. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer reflective units early, tighter turns during the viewport sequence—and sentence openings avoid template stems. Minor paraphrase appears in adjacent lines ("Charts here were mapped... yet my mind chased") and one metaphor weakens under scrutiny ("equations that crawled like pale constellations" mixes vehicle scales). No loops touch the closure beat; the final lines propel cleanly through "navigation instructor between worlds" to "room to expand." Proofreading is clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift. Overwriting is minimal, with figurative language concentrated in the viewport revelation where density serves accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The aid had once belonged to a retired switchboard operator, and it still remembered how to lean toward voices" establishes history, animates the object, and primes its use). Syntax varies purposefully; no template runs. Minor issue: a few lines lean slightly overwritten ("mist smeared the glass roof, turning streetlights into slow, underwater lanterns" is vivid but slows momentum in a setup beat). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and serves atmosphere without cluttering peak beats. The final line ("He named this quiet work incidental heroism") resolves by image and recharges the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clear, concrete, and propulsive with high information density—most sentences advance setting, character, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "the sea above breathed like a sleeping beast," "cables ran along the ceiling like black roots." No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor deduction for one moment of slight overwriting: "the arterial undersea links that once fed continents their whispers" stacks metaphor and elevated diction in a way that momentarily slows the beat. The final line—"the sphere whispering of return"—is vivid and specific, charging closure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (e.g., "moon-pale against the black metal, a small monument to miscalculation" does triple duty). The ink-spread description and algorithmic pivot beats propel without padding. Minor template cadence in the setup (several "I [verb]" stems in succession) and a few filter verbs ("I hear," "I see") slightly dull immediacy but do not touch closure. No loops or metaphor muddle in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("copper-veined," "pale lightning frozen in stone," "black throat swallowing"), which ornaments more than propels in several beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "quietly articulate even in silence" / "quietly articulate even in thought" / "quietly articulate" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]" in succession, flattening rhythm. Clarity remains intact and no grammatical errors, but the accumulation of decorative phrasing and repetitive stems triggers −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the core concept without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative density: "purple lamps hummed like patient hornets," "her gray braid swinging like a pendulum that had made peace with time." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high throughout. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching, creating occasional register drift ("river talk and thumb grease," "static-laden confessions" feel slightly over-decorated). No loops or scaffolding artifacts detected. The final line is the weakest: "Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" reads as unearned abstraction rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and imagery vivid, with strong phrases like "roots snapped their copper harnesses with gentle pops, like knuckles flexing after long restraint." Information density is high in the uprooting sequence. However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors and elevated diction during peak beats: "the city strain against some invisible tether," "a wash of images," "a bruised velvet dome over metal skeletons." Mild paraphrase loop: paragraphs 13–15 cycle around the orchard signaling/speaking without advancing new information. Template cadence in several adjacent sentences beginning "The statues…," "The machinists…," "Lio…" creates momentary flatness. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in the middle third, preventing entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "bruised cobalt," "weather of suspicion," "ink washing from a wound," "lightning licked the inside curve." Several metaphors are vivid but some ("smuggling drone border" as metaphor vs. literal tech, "thunderstorm in a bottle" as both object and symbol) blur vehicle-tenor boundaries without clear pattern-teaching. Minor loops: "missing" appears thrice in close succession; "silence" and "absence" echo frequently. The storm-bottle's mechanics are shown (tilted, clouds swirl, cork rattles) but late exposition ("storms remember... linked absences") partially re-narrates what the image already suggested. Information density is strong; no major template artifacts, but the prose could tighten in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, with sentence openings and paragraph lengths creating visual and aural variety. Information density is high in peak beats: the song sequence advances character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. However, figurative language saturates multiple consecutive sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "listening hush," "breathing" light), approaching overwriting in the discovery and song beats; this triggers a −0.5 deduction for density without obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly persistent steps" echoed by "quietly persistent in the new understanding" reduces propulsion slightly (−0.2). No grammar, tense, or pronoun errors; clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Its threads were frayed from years of late shifts and from brushing the corners of untidy shelves" conveys wear, routine, and tactile world). Sentence openings vary, and figurative language ("air grew cool and grainy, like the texture of old film") is specific. The "observed solitude" tone is sustained through modulated rhythm. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loop between "Most people assumed the library simply stored stories; Mariel suspected it also contained the coordinates of their beginnings" and the next two sentences restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence runs of "She + [past verb]" across the middle third (five consecutive openings) create rhythmic monotony (−0.4). "By nine o clock" (missing apostrophe) is a minor copy slip. These do not touch closure but accumulate to −0.6 total.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is mostly coherent ("breathing gills," "tidewrack"). However, several lines border on overwriting without clear payoff ("mist climbed the pier post by post," "syllables of breathing"), and minor template cadence appears in the villagers' requests paragraph. Information density is high, but a paraphrase loop exists between "vitalize the archive" and the explanation of fading islands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent: "the sky bruised into twilight," "the hair looked less like a keepsake and more like a vein torn from the dark," "space had inhaled." Rhythm varies and sentences avoid mechanical stems. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Template-cadence check: a few paragraph openings repeat "The locksmith [verb]" structure without taught pattern, triggering a −0.3 deduction in Q7. Stock metaphors appear ("sharp as a pin" for the star) without full transformation. The closure beat avoids loops and lands clearly. Overwriting density check: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (vial uncorking, pressure unfurling) without consistent lyric pattern-teaching, applying a −0.5 deduction per the Overwriting rule. Overall strong but falls short of 7.2+ due to accumulated craft slips that do not touch closure but reduce momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high: "the path down still remembered the press of my boots" does setting, character history, and tone in one image. Rhythm varies—short declaratives ("I knelt") alternate with longer accumulative beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One friction: "the hollow shapes they left" and "gaps overhead" echo the same absence-as-presence idea across distant beats without adding pressure; the repetition feels more thematic than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm modulates well ("doors groaned open like reluctant witnesses," "smiled like a drawn blade"). Three spots reduce momentum: "the way of those who had run out of places to run" paraphrases the prior "defiance like a second spine" without adding pressure; "emotional flatlining" is absent but two adjacent metaphors (ink in water, shadows amused) risk decorative stacking in one beat. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the opening third reaches threshold without teaching a lyric pattern early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is strong ("mist cooled my face," "roar below faded into a rhythmic breathing"). However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "pruning ghosts," "weaving between worlds," "threads of warmth," "colors…pooling…like ink in water," "fruit that tasted like remembered courage." Several metaphors cluster in the climactic beat (orchard repeated in other seasons, branches unbroke, essence captured), risking register drift and muddling clarity. Paraphrase loop: "The warmth surged, and the heirloom seed shimmered, absorbing the images" restates what was just shown in the vision. These artifacts appear in the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Figurative language ("tide pools gathered stray fragments of the sea," "shadows thickened...like curious birds") is coherent and purposeful. The knot-release sequence propels through concrete action without loops. Minor deductions: the phrase "accumulates silence" appears twice in near-identical constructions (line 3 and line 16), creating a small paraphrase loop. "Across sharing a secret" recurs verbatim in lines 10 and 32 without variation, reading as template cadence in a high-stakes beat (the final commitment). These artifacts do not obscure causality but slightly dull propulsion in peak moments. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; syntax varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and opening; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("a nostalgia for weather and recording," "the millimeter...widen[ed] into a road"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances character or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the map itself tore" and "the tear was not just in paper but in memory" revisit the same metaphor without added pressure. The final line ("only as a place to listen") lands cleanly. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, and no pronoun drift. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—"letters detached and drifted upward like startled fish" does multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two micro-issues: "I felt the familiar tightening in my chest, the sense that time was folding over" layers metaphor densely in a peak beat without full payoff, and "the physics of letting go" recurs identically across narrator and physicist, risking synonym fatigue. Clarity and propulsion otherwise remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "ghost in code," "curling constellations of graffiti," "white-veined instant," "latticed patterns," "tinkersong wonder" crowd the final third without clear mechanical payoff, reducing propulsion. Several paraphrase loops appear: "unspoken needs" / "questions that never found grammar" / "unvoiced prayers" recur without added nuance; "throat tight" / "tangled" / "shy knots" cycle synonym churn. Template cadence in places: "He had climbed... He had etched... He had encoded" (though separated by paragraphs). Stock metaphors ("trembling breath," "plucked string," "drawn bow") slightly reduce texture. Information density is strong in the middle beats (copper dust circuits, flower press mechanics) but the final paragraph ("tinkersong wonder, a music made of gears, raindrops, and syllables") stacks abstractions that blur the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean; no pronoun drift or tense errors.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion: "The elevator hummed as it pierced the clouds" sets kinetic momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, and stakes simultaneously. A few adjacent lines show minor paraphrase: "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" appears in paragraph 4, then "the joy beneath anguish in anyone" in paragraph 13, and returns in the final line; while purposeful as motif, the exact repetition without syntactic variation borders on template cadence. No filter-verb stacks or major loops touch closure. One figurative stretch: "breath a ghost ahead of her" is evocative but borders cliché; overall clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, information density is high. Figurative language is vivid and coherent—"dusty starlight, thin and granular, as if the universe needed sweeping" works without mixing vehicles. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: the "spooled wholeness" concept is restated in adjacent paragraphs with slight synonym churn ("record of having been" / "coil in space"). The final image is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, and the telescope's "oil of past hands" adds texture without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "She was a portrait artist who could not recognize faces, not even her own" reads slightly expository for the opening third; "The guild masters said she captured light as if it were a language older than ink" is elegant but risks slight over-writing in a high-density passage. The reflection paragraphs ("She had built a life by pretending...") contain light paraphrase loops ("every meeting started from zero, every goodbye dissolved into anonymity" restates the disability without added pressure). Overall density and momentum remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during observation ("Square three, pause, square five, leap"), longer constructions for reflection. Information density is high; most sentences perform multiple jobs (e.g., "sociable isolation" both describes setting and emotional state). Minor template-cadence slip in early paragraphs: "The first thing… The second was…" followed by "My name is…" reads slightly boilerplate. No paraphrase loops; metaphors ("like an old librarian wandering shifting shelves") remain coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines advance mood or action. Minor paraphrase loop: "I read them aloud, and the frozen air seemed to lean in, listening, while the gears... shifted faintly of their own accord" closely echoes "I listened to the hovering tick... matched it to the quiet chords of the gears" in structure and content without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one strain: "scatter of rescued stars" mixes metaphor with the concrete gears without clear vehicle. No major scaffold or template cadence; prose remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, character choice, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies purposefully, alternating compact declaratives ("Our settlement clung to one particularly low arch") with lyric expansions ("violet river curling into itself, becoming a luminous bruise"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity is strong throughout; spatial choreography and causal sequence track cleanly. One friction: "the bell followed the arches" in "the chalk followed the bell, and the bell followed the arches" momentarily obscures agency—does the bell follow architectural movement or atmospheric wind?—but recovers quickly. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("floating rock arches that drifted like reefs," "discarded vertebrae"), with no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"breath that had forgotten its owner," "every second was a chamber," "ripples of light pushing back a long-accepted shadow"—and several metaphors layer without clear vehicles (what does "a pane of hush" look like as an object?). "Nested patterns" recurs as a phrase in seven beats without variation, trending toward scaffold. Stock metaphor strings ("time thrumming like a trapped bird") and elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "accounting") appear in adjacent lines. Syntax varies, and information density is strong (lines often carry action, image, and implication). Two paraphrase loops: "He had not come to save the world; that promise had burned away" restates the same renunciation across two lines, and "bruised awe" / "vastness of what would still be lost" echo without adding pressure. Clarity holds but propulsion slows in the middle third under figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully: short bursts during action ("She walked, wavering, but the path held"), longer constructions in reflection. Figurative language is consistent and functional: "orchard clung…like a bad decision," "frost…remembered," "ghost paths…leaving impressions without touching." Two minor artifacts slightly dull momentum: "I grew precise in my failures, offhandedly exact in explaining risks" recycles the attribute as summary rather than showing it in a new beat, and "They were older than me, older than the road, older maybe than the cliff itself" stacks comparatives for emphasis that feels slightly overwritten. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in foam-pattern beats. Two modest slips lower the score: "She realized her project was not merely technical; it was the architecture of a divergent path chosen differently" is a paraphrase loop (the prior paragraph already stated this insight), and "loosened grief" / "grief loosened" / "her guilt loosen" recurs without pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths shift with beats. Information density is high in closure beats: "carving their absences into legible grooves, integrating scattered fragments into a shared ledger" does multiple jobs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor issues: a few near-paraphrases ("He felt mindfully scattered, as if his memories had been shelved… cataloged by emotion" adjacent to "instructions sat in his mind like unshelved books… never quite aligning") and template-adjacent stems ("He wondered whether…," "He realized with a start…," "He understood then…") in the vendor's reflection beats create slight drag. No loops touch closure; the final paragraph is clean. Grammar and punctuation are consistent. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "fanned it into something almost like memory" is slightly strained. Sequence clarity holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's measured exposition accelerates during the pavilion descent and contracts sharply when Rafi tastes the shards ("a slap delivered in panic, the sting echoing for years"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes—and figurative language (adobe ribs, coral as anemones, memories as shards that chime) remains coherent and voice-consistent. Deductions: minor paraphrase loop between "each table held dishes of stored remorse" and the subsequent shard descriptions; the phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" recurs in two forms within close proximity (staff, then coral), reading as template reinforcement rather than purposeful echo. The final paragraph's syntax is strong but the cadence slightly softens the closure image's charge. No grammar or continuity errors; spatial choreography is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense with purposeful metaphor ("voices that architecture hid," "dust motes moved like silent metronomes"), but the lyricism occasionally overreaches: "vigorously tender," "harmonious choral librarian," and "empathetically decisive" stack modifiers that feel constructed rather than embodied. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She explained... Their skepticism scattered... Together they descended..." follows a predictable opener pattern across adjacent beats. The final paragraph's "one body, many chambers, beating in time with mechanisms rehabilitated into mercy" lands the closure image cleanly despite elevated diction. No loops or scaffold debris, but information density could tighten in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings shift, and information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "Its three triangular segments were spiderwebbed with fractures, scattering moonlight into trembling constellations across his hands" advances prop state, image, and atmosphere). However, a mild template-cadence pattern emerges in the middle third—several "He saw" and "He felt" stems cluster within five lines, creating a slight drumbeat. The figurative density ("silver ivy," "fossils returning to a skeleton," "trembling constellations") remains coherent and voice-motivated, though one mixed note: "canyon itself were tasting his nervous system" anthropomorphizes abruptly. No paraphrase loops; scaffolding is minimal. Grammar and tense are clean, and the final image ("countless new vectors of possibility spiraling gently inside him") recharges the helix motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("wall thinned like skin over a racing heart," "columns rose like frozen smoke," "chains of faint lightning") and mostly coherent, but the accumulation across nearly every sentence risks overwriting without pattern-taught payoff. Mixed register: "clandestinely luminous" and "prism-minded" feel elevated relative to the moment's urgency. Paraphrase loop detected: "forgotten combinations" and "where forgotten combinations hide" recur without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the lyric mode, but the density in peak beats (chains dissolving, codex opening) does not always advance new information. Template cadence minor: several "He [verb]" stems cluster in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for density and loop friction combined, routed here per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opening lines anchor voice and setting cleanly ("Morning comes late to the siskin alder grove, as if light tiptoes on its toes"). Repeated sentence stems in the expository block ("Elders tell," "He learned," "He mapped," "Those lines led") create template cadence across four adjacent lines, triggering −0.5. "Tiptoes on its toes" is a minor stumble. Filter-verb stacks ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes," "he learned," "he calls") in the middle third dull momentum without adding pressure, adding −0.3. Information density is uneven: the sculpture backstory (lines 14–19) compresses setup efficiently, but adjacent lines paraphrase the same "cracks recorded silence" idea. No loops in the closure beat; the grove's motion and Lio's final pulse carry clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loops: "the boy" recurs across six beats without functional variation, and "fear returned" / "old fear" near the climax is mildly redundant. Template-cadence slip: "He had come" repeats stems ("He had taught," "He saw," "He whispered") across three paragraphs. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. The closing line ("as though the future had pressed its thumb beside his own") recharges the stone motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the sound-cataloging beats. Two craft frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop: "She had never been brave enough to read it, so instead he listened around it" immediately followed by "Now, as the last stray noises dwindled outside, he angled one of his directional microphones toward the closed journal"—the second restates the listening strategy. (2) Figurative density in the final third occasionally stacks without clear propulsion ("friction of pages pressed tight by time and stubborn love," "corridor paved... with questions," "shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but slightly dull momentum. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, sensory images are specific and purposeful ("corpse flower seed," "wildflower hush," "violet that tasted of iron"), and information density is high. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor artifact pattern: a few lines edge toward elevated register or stock poetic constructions ("dawn unraveled the last threads of mist," "pollen, golden and heavy") without harming clarity; they read voice-motivated rather than template-generated. One small scaffold slip: "hands trembling only slightly" is a filter-adjacent modifier that could be tightened. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors (swaying/serenity, rot/bloom) cohere and build across the piece. Propulsion is consistent; no bogged reflective loops. Final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings are diverse, and information density is high without padding. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("sleeping serpents," "constellations drawn in roots"). Minor loop: "water was not just water" and "something older, like stone remembering forests" approach paraphrase without adding pressure. The phrase "discover what he had come seeking, though not as he had imagined" is a scaffolding phrase that could be cut. No major artifact clusters, but the closure paragraph tilts slightly toward tell ("he realized") where dramatized image would sharpen propulsion. Line-level clarity and concision are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the investigator's survey or deepens the causal mystery. Rhythm varies purposefully: the opening paragraph breathes with longer lines, while the container labyrinth tightens to shorter, clipped beats. Minor loop: "singular convergence" appears three times with minimal reweighting between uses. Stock metaphor: "frozen waves" and "invisible hand that had tipped fate" feel generic. Figurative density is high in the opening third but does not obscure clarity. Propulsion is steady; the closure lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in sensory passages, but several lines loop conceptually: "He knew the sculptor…would soon raise the chisel" restates anticipation already established, and multiple sentences rephrase Ilen's waiting without added pressure. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers mid-piece. Figurative language is dense ("rivers of green and violet fire," "trapped thunderclouds") but remains coherent. The paraphrase loops and minor stem repetition justify mid-7 band placement with −0.4 applied for patterned artifacts that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the dominant question. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Some figurative language clusters ("dragonfly," "weave," "commas in a sentence," "wound") but all serve metaphorical coherence around connection and repair. Minor deduction: "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice in similar contexts without additional pressure, bordering on synonym echo. Otherwise, the prose is clean and propulsive with strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She did not look up when the last of the star-dust wind slipped in with me" anchors action, atmosphere, and relationship dynamic). Clarity holds across figurative language; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines with similar stems ("Mara claimed," "Mara insisted," "Mara smiled") and slight paraphrase in the mid-section explaining transposed empathy. The final beat is clean and propulsive. No loops touch closure, and the prose artifact load stays within tolerance, but the density of explanation in the middle third slightly dulls momentum before the press sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "smoke-scented handkerchief" conveys absence and intimacy). Rhythm varies with emotional state: staccato urgency early, elongated syntax during the aurora revelation. Two deductions: paraphrase loop at "He understood, dimly, that this was what it meant..." immediately followed by "You did not just move objects..." restates the same realization. Template cadence: "He told himself... but his fingers kept... Yet when he drew it out... Then Ralen had walked..." runs identical stem patterns across four sentences without taught pattern. Net: −0.8 for loops and cadence in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and metaphoric control ("frost feathered its windshield in branching rivers, every vein a sentence"). Sentence openings vary purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation, triggering the overwriting check (−0.3 for density). "Inconvenient honesty," "responsible liar," and similar constructions occasionally drift toward paradox for its own sake rather than clarity. No artifacts touch closure, so non-closure deduction applies, capping the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting cluster: "raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence spilled" recur within a short span and the metaphor vehicle (thread/unravel) is applied to silence, time, and puzzle without always clarifying the vehicle's logic—this risks figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat. Clarity holds but the density of textile metaphor in proximity draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level clarity is generally high, and figurative language ("wash of azure defiance," "wire strung tight") serves pressure without overloading. Information density is strong in the opening and closing thirds. Weaknesses: the middle section recycles explanatory stems ("The miners had left when...no one claimed to understand...Corren descended anyway") and stacks filter constructions ("he felt suspended," "as if waiting," "as if the mine had been eating"). The phrase "promises it a future if it would only hold together a little differently" drifts into abstraction during the peak beat. Minor paraphrase loop: "everything breakable was breaking" is echoed by "anything could still be made whole" without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. The opening anchors voice and the final line recharges prior motifs cleanly. Weaknesses cluster in the middle third: synonym loops ("weave between worlds the way other people weave between crowded market stalls"), abstract scaffolding ("the withheld truth had mass in my imagination"), and filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("I knew then," "I realized"). The corridor sequence contains paraphrase loops ("Each path carried a different weight… and in the press I finally understood") that dull momentum. These artifacts do not obscure closure but reduce propulsion entering the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, density is high, and clarity holds throughout. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information flows through action: the stone spiral, the letters, the sea-glass placement all advance story without scaffolding. Minor issues: "luminescent ache" and "the shuffle of his own breath and far-off surf" edge toward slightly overwritten figurative language; "a foolish, painful urge to bottle the feeling" uses abstract framing where concrete image would sharpen. No loops, clean grammar, strong verbs dominate. The piece propels without drag, and the final beat—scuffing stones "so the message would mean safe"—lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere (the wick grown from silicon and sand, the lenses turning starlight sideways). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at closure ("Laughing again, with a steadier, stranger joy, Orrin took the helm"). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Minor overwriting appears in the middle third: "the beam that wrapped around him thickened, a column of almost-solid light pointing not toward the dead shipping lanes but straight up through the open hatch" stacks modifiers without pattern-teaching. Filter verbs ("he sensed, rather than heard") occasionally dull immediacy. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, with the final image recharging prior motifs (glass, light, shadows) cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double duty (setting, character, theme). Clarity is strong in spatial choreography and sequence. However, metaphoric density appears in most sentences ("folded blue morpho wing remembering how to fly," "like mica," "metal filings to lodestone," "blade of dusk," "riverwater through dye") without sufficient breathing room or pattern-teaching, creating cumulative overwriting (−0.5). Several lines loop conceptually: "stories gathered...drawn by altitude, heat, and silence" and "stories arrive already half written" cover similar ground; "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" are restated rather than advanced (−0.3 for paraphrase). Stock metaphors ("testing how much wonder the ribs could hold") and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages dull immediacy in a few beats. These issues do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and cap the score at mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is propulsive and dense: "every leaking echo told him where the maze was tired" does triple work (setting, character perception, world-building). Rhythm varies—short urgent beats during the labyrinth's inhale, longer contemplative lines on the rooftop. Minor scaffold: "Later he would swear his real life diverged right there" tells what could be shown, and "he should have logged it...yet the maze seemed to hold its breath again" slightly hedges. The figurative language (seashell echo, moonlight pooled like spilt milk) is coherent and voice-appropriate. No loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high: "glass ribs," "ceiling of black mica window scales that faintly drank starlight," "earth itself wore bracelets of fractures." In the final third, metaphors cluster without clear pattern payoff—"dawn unfurled...from the people themselves, each heart casting a narrow, stubborn ray" stacks abstraction on abstraction. Mixed vehicle: "dawn unfurled" (fabric) then "casting a ray" (light) blurs coherence. Sentence openings vary, but several paragraphs loop thematic content: "Once, this place had known..." and "They had turned to Mara..." restate backstory without advancing present pressure. Apply −0.6 for density and coherence issues in peak beats, plus −0.3 for paraphrase loops in the backstory section.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the library reveal and the voicemail beat. However, several lines loop: "he had listened poorly once" is restated as "his younger brother pleaded for help and Elias, overwhelmed, locked his door and his heart," then again as "the overdose was ruled an accident; Elias knew it as a failure to stay"—three adjacent paragraphs re-establish the same backstory without added pressure. Template stems recur: "By choice he was," "Yet he noticed," "People came to borrow," "Beneath fluorescent hum," "Elias did not discover," "Now, every night"—seven consecutive openers that stack introductory clauses. The metaphor "small planet of nestled paradoxes orbiting older, unnamed suns" is evocative but self-contradictory (paradoxes don't orbit suns). These artifacts dull momentum in the first third and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty; they do not obscure the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density: "glassless arches frame the sky," "feral camellias root in broken pots," "the crumb surprisingly soft, strands stretching like reluctant threads of memory." Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful without muddle. Minor friction: a few template stems ("He comes here," "You think you could have") and one near-paraphrase loop (paragraphs on forgetting and the tea house opening). The filter-verb "seems" appears twice ("the tea house seems to fold closer," "people seem to sip at it"), but not clustered enough to dull immediacy. No loops touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean; clarity and momentum are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the longer opening establishes voice, shorter beats accelerate at peak pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: "Their words were not about safety or elevation… but about loneliness" tells slightly more than shows in a pivotal revelation, and "gently meticulous" appears twice within close proximity. The opening and closing images charge prior motifs cleanly. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery: "salt charms, teeth that remembered every bite," "tide slipped out from the pilings." Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor frictions: "the sagging boards and whispered barters were only another backwoods still to survey" leans slightly purple without adding clarity, and "as if already muffled by someone else's regret" tells what could be shown. These are hairline slips that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (most lines advance image, concept, or choice). However, several beats loop near-synonyms: "the taste shifted, sweetening" / "I tasted ozone, salt, and something like old paper" cluster within three paragraphs; "Because the world needed…" / "We became walking archives…" / "But archives are heavy…" form a stacked exposition run. Template cadence appears in the weather-bearer portraits ("One carried sunlight…another wore drizzle…the third was wrapped in slow snow"). These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third but do not obscure the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or pronoun ambiguity. The final line's rhythm charges the ending effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or symbolic weight. Rhythm varies across descent beats and the final vigil. However, multiple prose artifacts accumulate: "inescapable calling" appears three times in nearly identical phrasing (lines 5, 20, 34), creating a paraphrase loop around the core concept. "Auroral" appears four times, twice in the exact phrase "auroral sorrow," which reads as a stock poetic placeholder. Template cadence: "He [verb]…" structures recur across paragraphs 8–12 without taught patterning. The phrase "mnemonically gifted" is repeated verbatim in lines 8 and 28, reducing specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("he remembers," "he painted," "he started," "he vowed") in the backstory block slightly dull immediacy. These artifacts cluster in the middle third but do not obscure the closure beat; apply −0.9 for spread and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "He realized…" / "He felt…" stems recur; "honesty" and "dishonesty" are repeated without added pressure in adjacent lines; "condensation" appears in four beats with diminishing return. Figurative language ("roots strong," "breath on a tongue") is frequent but mostly apt. The final beat is clear and propulsive. Overwriting and scaffold are present but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and propulsion steady through the climactic beat. Some overwriting clusters figurative language: "hollow spheres of alloy, glass, and stray relics," "skeleton of brass bones and hanging glass organs," "slow planets, colliding notes into new orbits" stack metaphors without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "colors moved that he had no name for, shades like songs trapped mid-breath" restates namelessness. Template cadence appears in the opening third with repeated "Lio [verb]" stems and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. No grammatical errors; pronoun references clear. The artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the closure image materially, yet they accumulate across beats. Syntax varies well in the second half; the final paragraph sustains rhythm without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density high; most lines advance state or pressure. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and paragraph rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor template-cadence slip in the middle third: "He calculated...He knew...He opened...He rerouted" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems in close succession, creating momentary flatness. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language ("prayer flags," "data-embers," "algorithmic fire") stays coherent within the machine-organic fusion. The final image—"a garden that had burned and survived"—resonates without overwriting. Propulsion remains strong; scaffolding minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is vivid ("bougainvillea spilled like open veins," "cement crumbled with a soft surrender"). However, the piece carries multiple text-pattern artifacts: paraphrase loops ("listened to every siren two streets away" / "listening heals what concrete threatens"; "let others walk first into their own histories while she traced their steps" restates the lead-through-following concept without added pressure), template cadence in the circle-reconstruction passage ("An old postman... He remembered... A girl... took the locket next"), and stock metaphors ("open veins," "thirsty earth" implied by bougainvillea). The closure beat includes one loop: "moisture and time surrendered, and the cement crumbled with a soft surrender." Apply −0.8 for pattern density across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high ("To encrypt vulnerability as strength, she said, was to survive without becoming smaller"). However, the piece exhibits template-cadence runs in the middle third: "She had taught me...," "She had been teaching...," "She refused...," "She had been teaching..." clustered in rapid succession. Two paraphrase loops appear: the "explains through dance" motif is restated three times without added pressure (paragraph 20, 21, 32). The metaphor "as a spider spins its web" in paragraph 26 is structurally isolated and adds no causal or imagistic weight. These artifacts do not obscure closure but lower Q7 by −0.6 cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural cadence. High information density—most lines layer image, causality, and theme without padding. Figurative language is controlled: "fire folded inward, as if swallowed by invisible pockets of gravity" is coherent and central to the concept; "glowed faintly in the lamplight like memories flattened to thinness yet refusing to vanish" recharges the premise. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "gleaming silence" recurs three times, once as the required tone element, twice more as scaffold—borders on echo but remains atmospheric rather than redundant. Specificity is strong: cracked cup, glass trays, tide marks curving inward. Grammar and pronoun references are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances ritual, image, or pressure. Rhythm varies: long, layered sentences in setup compress to shorter beats at peak ("One by one…and then unraveled"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs ("shadow among many," "brief constellations," "terrestrially cosmic") edges toward overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. The metaphor of "tranquil blaze" recurs without muddle. Closure image is clean. A few stock phrases ("cloak spread like another shadow") and one near-repetition ("smoothed hush" / "hush thickened") nudge the score slightly below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies well ("It spoke of a family…of a fire…of stairwell arguments") and information density is high. Minor overwriting appears in the first half: "fingers turning pages without tearing them" and "thin page between floors" stack metaphors without pressure. A paraphrase loop near the opening ("asked why I had really come. For sugar, I insisted") restates the lie-dynamic twice in adjacent beats. The closing image ("closed my fingers around the seal and listened") delivers clean propulsion. No grammar errors, but figurative density in expository stretches ("curtain" of tea-smell, "conspirators in the next room") slightly exceeds voice-motivated need.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("syllables shaped like breath on glass," "sunlight on a flooded room"). However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence creates mild overwriting (e.g., "silence fit the shape of her thoughts," "mold in bread," "invisible librarian") without all metaphors earning their keep. A few near-paraphrase loops appear: "quarantined memory" is restated multiple times in close proximity, and the transformation from prisoner to archivist is explained twice in adjacent beats. Template cadence is avoided, but the figurative saturation and minor redundancy prevent entry into the 7.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift between subject-first and prepositional phrases. Information density is high in the opening third but slackens slightly in the middle with near-paraphrases ("He had never opened that letter" followed by "Since then he had served completion"). Template cadence appears in repeated "Irian [verb]" constructions across three sentences mid-piece, triggering −0.4. The phrase "stalactites drip" recurs without evolution, reading as filler (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative language ("bled like confession," "blade on glass") is purposeful and controlled, but "pearl twilight" and "aurora" are invoked multiple times without added weight. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high; the piece compresses backstory efficiently and integrates setting through action. Deductions: several paraphrase loops and stock metaphors ("the universe hums its secret song," "webs of intrigue hanging in the air") appear without strong payoff, and "reed-blown melancholy" recurs as a label rather than emerging through image. One template cadence run in the backstory section ("Voices confided… Every tale… Through them all…"). No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for distinct issues).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "candles guttered," "glitter clumping like wet ash," "tears froze almost as soon as they slid from her jaw." Information density is high in setting and image. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "weaves truth carefully" is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "windows of connection" / "thin places, where one reality fogged another" / "breath on glass" recycles the same metaphor across three beats without advancing pressure. The backstory summary (sister's wreck, descent, recovery) flattens momentum in the middle third. Template stems ("He saw... saw... saw") in the dream-window sequence create minor cadence monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, image, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled (moon paths as silver ladders, fireflies as floating lanterns) and the recurring "whispering parapet" phrase threads tactile specificity through the piece without becoming ornamental. Minor template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("He said… I said… He answered…" cluster mid-piece) which flattens rhythm slightly but does not obscure causality. The droplet-arc beat is clear and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphor strings touch the closure, so the high band remains accessible despite the brief cadence slip.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift with scene pressure. Information density is high (letters → pilot project → contingency keys in tight sequence). Two small loops: "flawed diamond" mentioned three times in close proximity without variation, and "geometric scars" echoed within two paragraphs without added pressure. The closure image is clear. No major artifacts touch the ending, but the repetitions slightly dull momentum mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high throughout; most sentences layer image, interiority, and world detail without padding. Figurative language is dense ("clouds roiled in bruised purples and feverous greens," "letters forming...as if someone knuckled them onto the back of his skull") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: a few metaphors approach overwriting in quick succession mid-story ("languages folding over each other, a tide of potential futures arguing cheerfully"), and "mountainous animals smelling a new trainer" feels slightly strained. The final paragraph sustains propulsion and clarity under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid and selective (sand, rust, lavender, wind). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "crouched the feral loft beneath the dunes, half-buried timbers jutting like broken ribs" anchors setting, tone, and decay metaphor simultaneously). Minor loop: "lonesome splendor" appears three times, risking churn; the phrase earns its final reprise but the mid-story echo feels reinforcing rather than advancing. Stock construction: "the way other men counted coins" and "the way tides listen to moons" repeat the simile stem. Figurative density in the opening third (broken ribs, shy birds, ghost, skeleton) is pattern-consistent and lyric-mode legible, but "positively wistful courage" stacks modifiers without clear yield. No major opacity or scaffold; grammar clean. Propulsion slows slightly in the woman's backstory summary ("war, hunger, stolen dances") but recovers. The final line ("ready at last to translate") closes with image and implication rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and dense with concrete imagery ("sunset smeared itself," "dust into floating, fleshly constellations"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, a cluster of mild artifacts appears: "felt fleshly ethereal" is a strained metaphor (flesh and ethereal contradict), and several adjacent sentences restate the hum's intensification without added detail ("hum hardened into a chord," "humming he felt did not belong to the lighthouse alone," "hum hardened into a chord that set his molars buzzing"). These loops and the metaphor muddle slightly reduce clarity in peak beats. Deduction: −0.8 for metaphor contradiction and paraphrase loop touching escalation; closure image remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("wind scraped at the stone walls with a restrained wildness"). Information density is high in the viaduct scene. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening two sentences both establish the sanctuary arrival; "impatience gnawed" is followed by "bright and restless, asking" in adjacent beats, restating the same affect. Template cadence in the task sequence ("follow the first crow... count the breaths... stand still") flattens momentum. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense without payoff ("moon rose split and haloed" adds texture but does not constrain choice). These artifacts do not obscure closure but lower line-level tightness. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance pressure or atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively ("The trains were stopped, but the rails still pinged softly"). However, repeated stems create template cadence: "I wanted to tell him," "I realized then," "I would have to," "If I stayed...If I wanted." The phrase "controlling influence" appears three times without variation, functioning as a conceptual loop. "Entangled memories" recurs four times, gaining slight specificity (as wires, as data) but verging on overuse. Figurative language is dense in places ("throat clearing itself," "air itself seemed bruised") but generally serves pressure. Clarity remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; high information density with lines often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The sound stuttered, catching on something invisible, like a confession snagging on a word never quite spoken" advances both the object and Elias's interior state). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "By the way light breaks through storm clouds, she finally murmured" feels slightly elevated for Mara's plain-spoken register in context, and the phrase itself arrives without prior setup, creating a small tonal bump in an otherwise tight beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully ("The gears-and-cogs workshop floated..."; "Orin whooped into the ringing silence"), and information density is high—most lines advance world, character, or pressure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the Algorithm read the shifting patterns like scripture" followed by "to transliterate the human mess of wanting into mechanical grammar" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template stems cluster in the middle third: "The Algorithm, Kalei said, wants to launch... It believes there is a bell... And you want to help it, Orin said..." The figurative density ("acid sea like a rusted cathedral refusing to admit it had drowned"; "maps seen from the perspective of a falling compass"; "a bruise-colored wound in the sky") is vivid but risks overwriting in adjacent sentences without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "deletion is a clean erasure" / "deleted does not mean gone" / "deleted files go" recurs without added pressure; "the system only routes the data" / "moved to a place with fewer witnesses" restates the same idea. The "713, over and over, like the system had learned to stutter" is vivid, but "kept resurfacing" and "orbited certain accounts" cover similar ground. Template cadence in the archive-description opening (scroll/photo/comment) is minor. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the mirror sequence. Information density is high ("One by one, he held it up...cataloging not only outcomes but reactions"). Minor loop: "He should have argued, but his calmly intuitive mind walked instead through the mirrors" immediately follows mirror work already in progress, creating a slight scaffold feel. Figurative language ("choices kneeling on his ribs," "grief hardened into borderlines") is vivid but occasionally elevated beyond immediate POV lexicon during high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density and rhythmic control: "time itself had developed a fold in patience," "trawling the shoreline for anything salvageable, our gloves slick with meltwater and the faint oil of ruined engines." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "the harbor where chunks of ice kissed and parted" is slightly clichéd personification in an otherwise fresh voice. The final beat—"everything choosing, moment by moment, not to end just yet"—propels without scaffold. A few filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One figurative cluster in the boat scene (gossip of molecules, animal considering) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("autumn light laying a soft copper band," "words crumble as if burned at the edges"). Clarity is mostly high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "fragile bridge between strangers" echoes across multiple beats without added pressure, and "destined mismatches" recurs without tactical shift. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the final image ("keeps watch, guarding not the grapes...but the fragile, flickering chance"), deflating momentum. Overwriting in peak beats: "passionate subtlety," "invisible paths," and "rhyme instead of overlap" stack metaphors that blur the immediate choice. Minor template cadence in descriptive beats ("He turns...," "She sits...," "Tomas sits...") without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual modulation; no template-cadence runs. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("iron and distant thunder," "whisperfield calm," "conjured clearings," "ledgers like fortresses," "cable lurched," "stone remembering stillness"), and while individually clear, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats (the merchant scene and the line walker's near-fall). Two paraphrase loops: "to preserve the echo of wisdom" (repeated across lines 17–18) and "strangely honest" (lines 11–12). No scaffold or synonym churn, and clarity remains intact at closure, so deductions are modest.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies across sentence lengths and structures; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor deductions: "rippled in afternoon heat, buzzing softly" and "curled at the edges like dried petals" lean toward stock imagery without fresh inflection. The phrase "almost apologetic hand" and "like restless whales" offer stronger texture. Paraphrase check passes—no adjacent loops. Template cadence: "I asked… I wrote… I felt" in the boy's beat shows minor repetition but does not obscure cause/effect. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; strong verbs and concrete nouns drive momentum ("dust rose in slow spirals," "chandelier whose candles had long ago been replaced"). High information density: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence in the crystal-voice sequence ("First came… Next… Then…") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so no penalty. One paraphrase loop: "growth did not move in straight lines" is immediately echoed by "leapt, stalled, bent back on itself," but the second adds specificity and serves escalation, so deduction is minimal (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "statues made of air and timed sprinklers and stolen theater smoke" anchors world logic and tone). Rhythm varies purposefully, sentences compress and expand with the search. Minor artifacts: "amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched" repeats verbatim, and "slipped away" / "slipping" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without pattern payoff. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the paraphrase loop ("slipped away...the way his own prophecies slipped away") slightly dulls momentum mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, and pressure simultaneously ("He had learned to judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling… Instead there were micrometeorites ticking against the hull"). Figurative language is controlled and coherent: "lantern nailed to the raw dark," "sky was flinging away pieces of itself," "lines of code racing… like illuminated script." Minor scaffolding appears in adjacent phrasing ("the quake deepened… the foundations shook") but does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. No loops, no template cadence, clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "small, obedient ghost" conveys both the paper and the emotional charge). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor paraphrase loop: "the scent of hope is like here, sharp and tender" and the earlier "citrus and pine scent threading through the antiseptic" restate sensory detail without added pressure (−0.2). One figurative density cluster in the clouds passage ("milk-white sea," "radiant tiers," "fields of unpicked cotton") risks slight overwriting but remains voice-motivated and legible. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the final line ("It was, she felt, enough") closes with image and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short sentences accelerate the key-turn ("Lysa turned the automaton key once, twice…"), longer ones during atmospheric setup. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "quietly deliberate even in rebellion, checking every curve of sound, every pause, as if walking a cliff" conveys character, method, and stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor and resonate. Minor artifacts: "doubled and tripled, all of her afraid and expectant" leans slightly purple; "smelling of hot metal and rain that had not yet fallen" is vivid but borders on overwriting in density. "Loops flared to life…an orbit of stillness" is a near-oxymoron that succeeds but risks confusion. Cumulative figurative load in the climax is high but stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("belief is lighter to carry than a cleft in certainty"). Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates through the garden discovery and slows for the bone-setting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the middle third: "rustled awake inside the garden, a blueprint of nostalgic innovation drawn in the dirt" stacks metaphors without full clarity, and "sky…horizon…scattered stars waiting to be connected" extends the constellation motif past peak efficacy. The closure beat is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most sentences layer action, memory, and sensory detail. Rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to charged closure. Minor overwriting: "veils of mist drift through the tunnels like slow comets" and "zephyr bloom" in close proximity risk figurative saturation without pattern-teaching. Template-cadence slip: "I begin to rub…I watch…I pause…I listen…I gather" runs of identical first-person stems across the middle third. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance image, character, or pressure (the pendant "older than the building, older than the crime," moss spreading "in a patient constellation"). Figurative language is generally controlled ("honeyed hush, thick with damp and chlorophyll," "plastic conduit sagged like abandoned vines"), though one mixed vehicle—"treating them like stepping stones laid out by some gentle, unseen hand"—introduces an agent (the hand) that the prior image (moss from thawing icicles) does not support. A paraphrase loop appears in the opening: "the servers were already gone" followed immediately by "All that remained...was an echoing shell" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence in the confession-backstory paragraph: "They looped...They dissected...They captioned" creates minor rhythmic monotony. These artifacts remain outside the closure beat and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence ("fog and barely-there light, page edges and punctuation," "ellipses so you are never accountable"). Some vehicles are strained or mixed ("narrator made of fog and punctuation" shifts register from atmospheric to typographic without clear logic). Template cadence in the visions sequence ("There was… There the… There his") creates rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: "The novelist watched the river and, for once, did not flinch" restates earlier avoidance without added pressure. Line-level clarity holds, but overwriting dulls momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; figurative language (brass feathers, glass seeds, iron-tasting shadows, branches aching wider) is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, several beats loop conceptually: "gathering hush" appears three times, "alignment" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "sacred practices" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "He had learned… He pressed… He smiled, then began… From the path, children arrived… Behind them shuffled…" runs identical construction for four consecutive beats. Filter-verb stack: "he believed," "he suspected," "he thought" cluster without voice-motivated need. Apply −0.6 for template runs and loops; no closure-beat harm.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally strained: "trees stood like exhausted metronomes, their bare branches paused between ticks" mixes metaphors (metronomes don't pause between ticks; they mark them). "Joints seemed to grind time itself into powder" is vivid but borders purple. Several sentences exceed clarity needs: "creating patterns with discarded items as if composing sentences the earth might finally understand" adds abstraction without precision. Information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear. Sentence rhythm varies well, supporting the slow, deliberate pacing. The final image is clean and propulsive. Overwriting in the middle third (multiple figurative vehicles per sentence without clear payoff) triggers −0.3 to −0.5, but closure beats remain untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many lines carry vivid sensory detail, but several beats loop or paraphrase: "He came to the cavern to reverse-engineer not just the timer, but time itself" restates the project's stakes without adding pressure; "Each word struck the stone and bounced, overlapping with the soft ticking" and the subsequent line about hearing "the angles themselves" recycle the same event. Template cadence appears in runs like "He set…then unpacked…He began…First he…" Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed: "a harvest of echoes" competes with "reservoir of sounds" and "droplet of echo," muddling the metaphor vehicle. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for mixed metaphors, totaling −0.9 within the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; figurative language serves pressure rather than ornament. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the closure beat. Overwriting check: dense metaphor in most lines ("bronze grotto," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "fractal dance") risks saturation, but the pattern is taught early and each image constrains action or charges the ending, so no deduction for density. Minor loop: "boundary-lessly trapped" appears twice in similar phrasing without escalation. Template-cadence check passes; sentence openings vary. No paraphrase loops, filter stacks, or register drift. Strong propulsion and clarity. The slight metaphor density and one repeated phrase prevent entry to 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance both present action and thematic weight (e.g., "Steam begins to cloud the glass above, softening the gray sky into something nearer to memory"). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences giving way to clipped present beats at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate ("beads on a broken string," "crystallized time"). Minor penalty: "accidents, they called it, the way a storm is called weather" skews slightly abstract for peak emotional beat, and one or two filter-verb clusters ("she thinks," "she knew") could tighten, though they remain voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm is varied and purposeful; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high: nearly every line advances image, memory, or negotiation. A paraphrase-loop issue: "I thought if I filled myself with enough borrowed lives, the gaps in my timeline would stop aching" and the ghost's "you fed on echoes" restate the same idea across adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "the lagoon sands them down, grain by grain, until they are smooth enough to skip" conflates grinding and skipping stones without clear vehicle. Stock phrase: "smooth enough to skip" is a minor cliché. No template cadence or major scaffold. Propulsion is strong through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (e.g., "Carnivals... were masters of temporary systems that pretended to be permanent" advances theme and situates her observation skill). Template cadence appears in a mid-section run: "She could not summon... but she could redirect... In the maintenance closet she found... The manual's pages crackled... Mira laid the sextant..." (five consecutive "She/The/Mira" stems). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching a payoff for every metaphor (intentions as stress, flows as belief, navigation as lostness). Clarity holds but momentum sags in the expository middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: lines do double duty (e.g., "excruciatingly gentle" modifies both handwriting and touch, echoing the attribute across beats). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the repair sequence. Deductions for overwriting: figurative density clusters in the opening and mid-section ("the clocks liked to pretend they were quiet," "a glacial hush held every breath on the tip of breaking," "the sanctuary swallowed it") without always advancing pressure; mixed vehicle in "bear other people's hours" (hours as burden) versus "wear his" (hours as garment) creates minor incoherence. The phrase "excruciatingly gentle" recurs three times within 800 words, risking decorative repetition, though each use advances characterization. These issues do not touch closure but accumulate to −0.9 within this category.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Every step was guided by a quiet hunger to understand the architecture of lies" establishes motive, tone, and the metaphor governing perception). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the figurative language—while dense—remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor deductions: a few filter verbs ("felt hindsight clarity strike") slightly dull immediacy, and the phrase "serene upheaval" in the final sentence risks thematic echo. One near-loop: "thoughtfully clear" and "thoughtful stillness" within close proximity. Still, no major artifacts touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (fulgurite-lit rope, knot-images). However, paraphrase loops appear: "fog rolling across the harbor" recurs three times with minimal variation, and "golden dock under snow" appears identically twice in close proximity without pattern-taught justification. Template cadence is present in middle paragraphs ("He had been told...," "If that were true...," "With his free hand...") that flatten propulsion. Figurative language is generally coherent, but "fog...like a slow thought" borders on abstraction. No severe artifacts touch closure, so caps do not apply, but the loops and stems lower the score within band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density and purposeful rhythm; opening line ("last ship sailed at dawn, leaving the harbor bare as a stripped altar") anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Sentence-level propulsion varies appropriately (longer contemplative units in the garden walk, tighter clauses in Sera's direct explanation). Minor overwriting in the middle third: "her silence brushed against my skin, an intimate greeting by projecting presence alone" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence, and "vividly descriptive" as an attributed trait ("Her voice grew vividly descriptive") feels slightly label-only rather than demonstrated through syntax or lexical texture. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; closure image is clean and charged. Deduct −0.3 for figurative density in one beat that doesn't fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but coherent ("cables threading from it like spilled hair," "stalactites loomed like teeth of a sleeping god"). Clarity is maintained through most beats. However, some lines edge toward overwriting without adding pressure: "a quaking reverie made of light and breath" stacks abstractions. Minor paraphrase loop: the prince's trembling is mentioned three times without variation. Information density is generally strong; sentence-level propulsion is present but occasionally slows under metaphor weight. No grammar errors; sequencing is clear. The final line ("waiting for the crack of a new dawn") effectively reprises "first dawn" from earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is dense: "kelp-drift peace curling in slow hieroglyphs," "eyes, dark as wet pumice." Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Two minor artifacts: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" appears identically twice (paraphrase loop), and "the migration of clouds" recurs without reweighting, creating faint template cadence. These don't obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language creates texture ("stone basins sat dry and hollow," "memories clotted in the city like leaves strangling gutters"). However, several beats show template cadence and ornamental phrasing: "All of them, she believed, were being slowly siphoned" front-loads filter verbs; "The breadcrumbs were not crumbs at all, but small anomalies" is a rhetorical pivot that stalls momentum; "hovering," "trembling," "shuddering" cluster in the fountain-touch scene. Paraphrase loops appear: the defiant hush is described twice in similar terms (lines 8 and 24), and several lines about fountains as locks restate the same idea. Clarity remains high, but density could tighten; some sentences do decorative work without advancing situation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each tick is a sonar pinging through the luminous fog, echoing off unseen futures and returning with possibilities slippery as light" advances both setting and the protagonist's uncertainty). Rhythm varies naturally with longer reflective sentences giving way to shorter actions in the final paragraph. Minor overwriting in the middle: "troubling serenity pools in the shadows" and "invisible hands" lean toward stock metaphor without full transformation. One paraphrase loop: "I wonder whether tending this place is enough" followed by "Perhaps, if I do this long enough" restates the same doubt without added pressure. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short crisis beats ("You brought it, she said") alternate with longer descriptive passages. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character memory, or carving ritual. Figurative language is controlled: "glass bones," "river of color," "shadows of the fig trees" all serve POV and setting. Two minor issues prevent higher score: "the thundering calm of rain on distant hills" mixes scale incoherently (thundering versus calm), and the phrase "fiercely meditative" is asserted without embodied grounding. The closing line risks slight overwriting—"grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts into one quiet body" stacks three metaphoric elements where two might have been sharper. No template cadence or synonym loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, figurative language is coherent (clock-spring snap, frost on windowpanes), and information density is high. Two deductions: (1) "incremental absolution" and "shared balance" recur as near-paraphrase across multiple beats without significant reweighting until the end (−0.3 for mild loop). (2) A few filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I had come to believe," "I realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats (−0.2). Closure beat remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies well ("Each rung echoing like a small gong"), and information density is high. However, several metaphors stack without paying off: "sealed cobalt candle," "cold inland sea," "velveteen gloom...like ink through watered silk"—these accumulate decoratively in the opening third without altering tactics. Minor template cadence: "I had found... I had learned... I understood" in close succession. The tapestry-reveal beat is clear, but "the pattern refused to settle in my mind" and "symbols that refused to hold still" repeat the same evasion across two paragraphs. Proofreading is clean, and the final line ("the velveteen gloom outside felt softer") recharges the opening image effectively. Deductions for figurative density and minor loops prevent 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean and purposeful. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image ("lowered the nib toward the future he had dared to imagine") resonates. Sentence rhythms vary, and information density is high (e.g., the paragraph introducing the three-year cycle packs mechanism and stakes efficiently). Minor loop: "Charts of possible harbors overlapped with forecasts…each line hedged with probabilities" and the prior paragraph's "fragments into charts" repeat the mapping-as-translation idea without advancing pressure. Small register drift: "sustaining transformation" in the leapfrogging explanation feels slightly elevated relative to Elian's grounded interiority elsewhere. No major artifacts, but these small slips prevent entry to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stories nudging at his outline," "thistled calm"). Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes. Two frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("Lina listened not for comfort, but for instruction" followed immediately by why she listens again), and "secretly luminous" recurs as a template modifier (dial, hope) without evolving meaning. The overwriting does not obscure closure but adds decorative weight in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer reflective passages) and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops in adjacent lines—"Tonight she will powder the gallery floor" immediately followed by "Every ceremony, she tells them, is to crystallize a fleeting emotion"—and repeated stems ("She draws... then burns... and powders"; "Some of the names belong... others to... and a few to") create template cadence. The reflective middle ("Later, reporters asked... Now, standing...") compresses transit efficiently but borders on summarizing pivotal backstory (the fire escape) rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "Philosophers always did their best work underground" establishes aspiration and irony simultaneously). Figurative language is controlled: "beetle burrowing through history's compost" and "truth settles like silt" are coherent and pay off at closure. Minor template cadence in mid-section: three consecutive "Once.../Now.../Every evening..." stems create brief rhythm flatness, but the effect dissipates before the ending. No paraphrase loops, minimal scaffold, and the final line's teeth-on-metal image lands with propulsion. Syntax varies purposefully, and the read-aloud test passes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; sentences layer action, atmosphere, and interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the opening lines ("quiet as frost," "music lingered there like breath between pages"). Two minor frictions: "denote" appears twice with identical usage ("to denote the circle," "those silences stand, for they too denoted a kind of music"), creating a loop, and one paraphrase near the end ("as rain ticked faintly" / "stood by the zither...unsure" rehashes the transition already clear from the scene break). Figurative language is dense but remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift. The closing beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; the opening ("rasped in the wind like an old lung") and final image are vivid and propulsive. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "We are not fighting the past, she said, we are disagreeing with its ending" is thematically rich but structurally repeats the same idea. "Dust motes turned like tiny planets" and "vines once arched like cathedral ribs" stack figurative language in descriptive beats without advancing pressure. The filter-verb "felt" appears in multiple high-pressure lines ("felt to Kai like a small betrayal," "felt more like laughter") where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality or closure; applying −0.6 for template cadence and filter stacks under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). Minor deductions: several paraphrase loops ("the city," "the tower," "the boy" as repeated sentence subjects across adjacent lines) and template cadence in the opening third ("she told herself," "she could not," "she saw") create mild scaffold feel. One mixed metaphor: "nectar dusk" as a taste is vivid but "thick and slow over the abandoned toll bridge" shifts vehicle mid-image. No loops touch the closure beat; the final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure. Rhythm varies (short declaratives under tension, longer accumulative clauses during cataloging). Figurative language—"streetlights daydream," "moths wrote urgent letters," "pushing curtains across the sky"—is consistent and voice-motivated, but clusters heavily in the night-observation beats without full payoff at closure. One paraphrase loop: "seemed to breathe" / "house's breathing" / "synced with his own." No pronoun drift or scaffold. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Propulsion is clear; no opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; lines often do double duty (e.g., "her oxygen thin, but her gaze cut through the water, incisively kind"). Rhythm varies with pressure: short clauses accelerate the collapse, longer ones breathe during reflection. Two minor loops: "animate lifeless" recurs identically in two paragraphs, and "structural weakness" appears three times without reweighting. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I saw") are minimal and voice-motivated. No paraphrase cycles at closure. Figurative language is purposeful ("loosened ink," "receding waves") but "drowned candelabra" and "drowned dawn" echo each other slightly. Overall propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the chipped die lay skewed, its imperfection insisting that chance was always already written into the stone" advances object, theme, and character stance simultaneously). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the rupture beat and breathing in the closing reflection. Minor template cadence in the opening third: "He climbed not to reach... but to prove" / "Not by going back... but by refusing" creates a brief rhetorical stack. One paraphrase slip: "numbers never carried messages" followed immediately by "the chipped die lay skewed, its imperfection insisting"—the latter restates the former's premise. No filter-verb stacks or significant loops elsewhere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reconfigure the texture motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries high information density (brush backstory, lost-language practice, three stranger-flashes). However, several lines loop near-synonyms: "forgot itself" echoes "misplaced"; "angles the lamps away, letting only the moon's diluted shine" restates what "angled away" already implied. The figurative load is heavy throughout ("clogged lung," "breath on glass," "vines teaching themselves to climb"), occasionally blurring momentum. The closure image is clean. Apply −0.6 for loops and density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; strong concrete images dominate (basalt arch, mist-clouds, damp dough shaped into letters). Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "everything felt so brittle" / "stone that had seen too many partings" restate fragility; "catalog whatever history had not been washed away" / "rescue dying arts before they slipped under the tide of necessity" loop the preservation motive; "thaw even the oldest stone" / "before… it thaws and runs back into the waterfall" repeat the thaw motif without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "I told her… She asked… I said… She asked… I raised…" runs across five beats. Combined, these trigger −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stem repetition (−1.0 total in Q7). The closure beat itself is clean and propulsive, capping the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies effectively across beats; information density is high (the yoyo description does triple duty: world-building, puzzle, and thematic charge). Clarity is strong in the dissection sequence and spatial choreography. Weakness: template cadence appears in the stair-descent section—multiple "he [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences—and a minor paraphrase loop occurs around "hunger stone" exposition (paragraphs 6–8 restate its nature without added pressure). The loop and stem-run combine for −0.6 in this category. Figurative language ("rotting jaw," "held breath") is coherent and serves voice, avoiding overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat artifacts, keeping the penalty localized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with some mixed metaphors: "vomiting yellow halos" and "voice as soft as spoiled fruit" work, but "whispering advisor" and "damp fingertip on his thoughts" remain abstract. Paraphrase loops appear: "lingering luminance" recurs in lines 1, 23, and 26 without functional variation; "photographically cursed" appears in lines 6 and 36 as a label. Template cadence runs (lines 18–20: "Through… his future self had been trying… Do not trust… Another line…") flatten momentum. Elevated diction ("unbosom," "paradoxical," "resuscitation") in peak beats clashes with the POV's visceral lens. Information density is strong, but scaffold reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively: short bursts during crisis ("Children clung to trunk-rails; someone cursed…"), longer swells during reflection. Information density is high—most lines advance action, atmosphere, and Aera's interiority simultaneously. Minor loop: "obstacles" recurs three times in close proximity (one in direct thought, one in narrative summary of grandmother, one in thematic framing), creating paraphrase pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("clouds were restless strokes of charcoal," "apples clacking like teeth"). One mixed metaphor: "sketched resonance in the air, faint lines only she could sense" blurs visual and auditory without clear vehicle. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the recurrence and metaphor slip cap the score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: long contemplative sentences ("The turtles did not speak with mouths, but with slow tides of motion…") tighten at closure ("Then the turtles began to turn"). Information density is high—nearly every line advances world logic, guilt, or turtle-pattern stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "fossilized waves," "scabbed lace," "bruised gold" match the sunwashed-dread tone without overwriting. Minor deductions: "the pull sat in his chest like a grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell" stacks two metaphors in one beat; "bright enough to hide its bruises" and "drowned quietly beneath the tide bells" approach purple in adjacent early paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "quietly driven" is both stated and shown in close succession. No template cadence or scaffold, and the final line delivers clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled—ivy as handwriting, tendril as green hand—and supports atmosphere without obscuring action. Minor: a few elevated constructions ("morally luminous," "secret massacres disguised as necessary sacrifices") edge toward summary-telling in the backstory block, and "emotionally rational" appears twice in similar phrasing. The opening rosebush image and closing echo of tracks create effective framing. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high (most lines do two jobs—description + character state). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("salt light," "flexing black surface," "bones of the harbor"). One mixed metaphor: "invisible archive thickens inside the bones" (bones hold marrow or structure, not archives), reducing clarity slightly. The phrase "slow gnaw of the sea" is borderline stock but fits voice. Proofreading clean; grammar stable. The piece narrowly misses 8.2+ due to the metaphor muddle and two instances of slightly elevated diction ("interlaced absence," "oceanic smoothness") that feel more authorial than character-POV under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Information density is high—most lines do multi-job work (e.g., "swollen book of acquisitions from a century before the flood" anchors time, object, and decay). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "the library exhaled a faint, papery hush, not quite its usual breathing, more like the pause before confession" stacks three metaphoric vehicles without full coherence (exhale/hush/pause/confession). A second mild overwrite: "dappled resolve" in a high-pressure beat feels elevated beyond POV lexicon. Deduct −0.6 for two distinct density issues per the tightened overwriting check. Otherwise clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "steam twisting like uncut paper," "a blade polished on thunder," "a second, burning moon," "petals unfolding into sheets of glowing rice paper." In the climax paragraph, three metaphors compete without physical coherence (glass opens like a flower into rice paper—how?). Paraphrase loop: "grief...to keep it from rotting, to turn ache into architecture" restates the same idea. Template cadence: multiple "she [verb]" stems in the final third. Information density is high, but clarity occasionally yields to ornament. Apply −0.6 for density and coherence slips in peak beats, and −0.2 for the paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("shadow across the ruined desert like a question mark that never closed," "probability clouds shimmer and tilt"). One mixed metaphor: "wells" as basins of possibility are "hauled up in buckets," but vortices don't map cleanly to liquid extraction—minor incoherence. The piece carries minimal scaffold; information density is strong (most lines do double duty). A run of "I told myself… The truth is… I wanted…" in the middle third uses similar stems, creating brief template cadence (−0.3). The final image is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines do double work: "the metal clicking like a punctuation mark" anchors sound and thematic closure. Stock metaphors appear ("pinpricks in a shroud," "quiet clink of a key slipping into a long closed lock") that dull specificity. A paraphrase loop surfaces in the climax: "she begins to map the tones to the stars, the stars to the empty squares, and the squares to the faces" restates the same process across three clauses without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in adjacent sentences: "Long ago, Leto explains... They brought whatever... and we tried..." / "Now it is this chip, Mira says..." Figurative density is high but mostly legible; mixed metaphors are rare. The final line recharges "frequency of belonging" without scaffold. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, but the loops and stock images prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high, with lines often doing double work (e.g., "I forged documents that severed me from my blood, erasing a name that tasted of iron" advances backstory, guilt, and stakes simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops are present. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "silence feels like a sieved hush, as if the world has strained every sound except this question" mixes auditory filtering with abstract straining in a way that slightly muddies the vehicle. The figurative density in the middle third (watch hand as "pulse with no beat," corridors of "unwritten file," symbols that "prick like half-remembered handwriting") accumulates without obscuring causality, but three metaphors in close succession test coherence. Propulsion remains strong through the shore sequence, and the final image is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is controlled ("mist crawled," "beetle shells," "grief-stricken mother did not notice missing"). Information density is high in the exchange sequence. Two penalties: (1) "between apology and forgiveness" appears three times across paragraphs 6, 13, and the ending—acceptable as motif but edges toward loop when not functionally reweighted in the middle instance (−0.2). (2) Paragraph 5's "uncommonly thoughtful...a blessing and not a slow form of drowning" stacks metaphor without full coherence (−0.3). The closure beat—untethering the lantern, the brother's gaze—is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, or pressure (e.g., "the backlash of regrets had been slow, then sudden, like a spring tide you think you can outrun until your feet leave the sand"). Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("fog clung...like wet wool," "silence eventually formed a grid I could not climb"). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The backlash of regrets did not lessen, but it changed texture" followed by "I turned the kayak, awkwardly at first" reads slightly stitched, though the two thoughts are distinct enough. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the compass motif. One friction: "merrily melancholic" as phrase, though purposeful, leans slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong figurative control in peak beats ("history used to sit," "stamina, injury recovery, or object behavior used for convenience" never applies). Information density is high; nearly every line advances discovery or thematic charge. Minor paraphrase loop: "This, then, was what I had been protecting" followed immediately by "Not treasure, not escape, but a place…" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in the cleanse-clinic paragraph ("scrubbed away… scoured off… leaving") slightly flattens momentum. Clarity and propulsion otherwise excellent; no filter stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("moon... nailed to the sky," "hair of drifting smoke"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I do not understand then / did not understand" and "distance would be death / bridge would demand my own unmaking" restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I was taught," "No one told me," "You should not have") and synonym churn around transformation terms accumulate to −0.8. The closure image is vivid, but earlier scaffolding dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer atmospheric lines early and shorter urgent beats at the turn. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Two minor issues: "the clouds below surged upward like a tide of luminous ash" stacks metaphor heavily in a peak beat, and "Yet here he was on the mountain" is a scaffold phrase that could be cut without loss. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is generally controlled, though density spikes in the bridge-vision sequence without always clarifying the image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines advance situation, character perception, and thematic weight simultaneously. Some figurative language stacks without full payoff: "chapel and wound," "seeded with lattices of quantum memory and something less easily named" gestures at mystery rather than specifying it. Two minor paraphrase loops: paragraphs on shadow work definition and the locked dimension's nature each restate their core concept across adjacent sentences. The closing sequence maintains clarity and propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled except in two beats: "tame constellations," "notes in a hidden song," "smoldered green-gold," "fallen constellations" cluster decoratively without pressure payoff. The phrase "whispering hush rose...soft insistence" and its variant "whispering hush stiffened into a tug" loop conceptually across adjacent paragraphs. No template cadence or major scaffold, but the figurative density in setup beats and the concept loop together trigger −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She wore the slate uniform of the wardens, but her gaze wandered like a calmly inventive mechanic appraising a broken engine" establishes role, trait, and stance). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor overwriting appears in figurative density during setup ("bottled daylight," "winking hush," "smoky bruise") but remains voice-consistent and legible. The final beat's clarity is untouched. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("aurora like melted compasses," "eels ribboning through air like they were carved in water"), though "borrowed dawn of courage" and "fear arriving before he felt it" drift into abstraction without grounding stimulus. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports the slow accumulation. Minor template cadence appears in mid-beats ("The elders called them... the astronomer-priests whispered..."). No paraphrase loops. Propulsion is steady but the figurative density in the ritual sequence risks slowing momentum slightly; some lines do double duty, others linger for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    High figurative density throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated imagery. While voice-consistent, the accumulation risks over-writing in places: "furiously tranquil" as both attribute and repeated phrase, "bruised halos," "temporary handwriting" of lightning. Some phrases border on stock lyricism ("violence of sky," "quiet acquiescences"). Rhythm varies well; information density is strong. Minor scaffold: "The phrase hung between them, heavier than the storm" tells weight rather than showing its effect. No loops or clarity breaks, but the metaphor load in peak beats (the telescope vision) competes for attention. Closure image is clear despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong image clusters (fractured sunlight, needle constellations, clockwork gears). Information density is high; sentences layer description and backstory efficiently. However, the piece contains paraphrase loops: "waited" and "waiting" recur across multiple paragraphs without new pressure, and the middle third rehashes Darius's method in overlapping summaries. The phrase "half-painted sundial" appears five times; "questions into destinations" three times. Template cadence in the client arrival ("bowed shallowly, as if even courtesy were a hypothesis") lands as decorative flourish. No artifact touches the closure beat, but repetition dulls momentum mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—which creates a lush texture but risks overwriting in peak beats. The patrol scene tightens syntax effectively ("Lio snaps the candle out"), yet even there metaphorical language persists ("weary archivist," "fracture toward light"). Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "counting my borrowed names" / "Tonight I am a vagrant penny poet" / "molts personalities monthly" all restate the same fluidity concept within the opening. Template cadence is present in the "we [verb], [object]" pattern near the end. Information density is strong—most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere—but the piece would benefit from pruning decorative metaphors in the middle third. No grammar errors; pronoun references are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; most lines serve character, atmosphere, and pressure. Rhythm modulates well (short urgency at discovery, longer breath in arbor). Some minor text artifacts: "flickering" appears three times in close proximity (projection, compasses, monochrome), and "strategically creative" + "until the horizon invited night" repeat verbatim across beats, creating slight template echo. "Flickering compasses" recurs purposefully but "flickering" as descriptor spreads beyond need. No major loops or scaffold, but tightening these would sharpen momentum. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "slow-motion waves of mist" and "catching slow-motion waves" risk redundancy but remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentence stems avoid uniformity. Information density is high in the dream sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "ancient ridge in bloom" recurs four times; "luminous doubt" appears three times in similar constructions without meaningfully reweighting. The phrase "before monsoon arrives" and variants repeat across four beats. Stock metaphor: "wrinkles look like riverbeds" is functional but familiar. Template cadence in the council scene: "The island is reaching backward...It dreams of a story...You must decide" reads like stacked declaratives. Minor filter-verb stack ("felt honest yet unfinished," "felt pride strain," "feeling luminous doubt") dulls immediacy in high-pressure moments. Artifacts do not obscure causality but blunt momentum; baseline −0.6 in Q7, escalated to −0.9 for touching the closure beat ("feeling luminous doubt pool").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("compass needle jerked…unable to settle, as if hounded by unfinished journeys"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "rhythmically placid" recurs in nearly identical phrasing across paragraphs, and several lines restate the tutor's silence or the compass's indecision without added pressure. Figurative density is heavy throughout ("color of rinsed ink," "sea-stained violet edged with salt," "diffuse…smearing silver"), bordering on overwriting in middle beats where clarity would serve better. The phrase "tides of remembrance" is invoked twice with minimal variation. Template cadence is minimal, but the accumulation of lyric description without causal linkage in some passages (e.g., multiple lines on the lace's appearance before its function is revealed) creates minor drag. No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are dense but clear, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“a local clock she could smell on her hands”). Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, with minimal purple prose and no significant looped paraphrasing or template cadence. The prose modulates pace intelligently—slowing for reflective turns, tightening around physical actions like taping leaks—without stalling momentum. I see no figurative muddle or artifact that blurs the closure image; the diction supports rather than smothers the story’s subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but mostly high-information, with images doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (e.g., frost as trade routes, then mirrored in the ledger). Sentence rhythms vary and avoid mechanical patterns; there are no significant paraphrase loops or clarity failures. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, with metaphors rarely mixed or confusing, and the final lines land cleanly. The only quibble is that a handful of phrases flirt with over-lyricism, but they do not stall momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and vivid, with most sentences doing double or triple duty in atmosphere, character, and world-building. Metaphor density is high but largely coherent and thematically aligned (water, ice, sound, vibration), avoiding mixed or confusing images; repetitions like “unshaken marvels” function as purposeful motifs rather than loops. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym churn, and rhythm varies effectively. A few phrases (“mute catastrophe,” perhaps) edge toward familiar lyric shorthand, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is notably strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and do more than one job, weaving atmosphere with character and premise. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images are clear and rarely mixed, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Rhythm tracks the journey well, lengthening and thickening as Elias descends and compressing slightly in the final realizations. The only limitation is that the lushness is nearly uniform—one or two deliberately plainer beats under emotional stress might increase contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is tight, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do double duty for setting, character, and mood. Figurative language (“amplified quiet,” “thin them into shadows”) is striking but not overstacked, and it coheres tonally. Line-level rhythm is varied, and paragraphs break at meaningful emotional and narrative turns. I see no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues that would dull momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but purposeful imagery, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; metaphors like “unused love…like birds trapped in a library” do double duty for character and theme. The rhythm supports the accumulative pressure, slowing for vision and tightening around the encounter with the boy. Some images edge toward purple or pile up (“darkness thick as wool, pulsing like a covered wound”), which a very strict editor might trim for maximal sharpness, but they don’t obscure sense or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, vivid, and multifunctional, with very little scaffolding or redundancy: most sentences advance both atmosphere and idea. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around geometry, memory, and organic structures, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple drift that would blur sense. Rhythm varies well, supporting the mounting strangeness without sacrificing clarity of action, especially in the closing sequence on the bridge. There are no noticeable syntactic loops or filter-verb stacks that would drag momentum or cloud the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Syntax varies well, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus character). The figurative language is vivid but not overgrown, and it rarely muddies clarity even when ambitious. There are no visible grammatical or pacing artifacts, and the final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with information, and generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is abundant but controlled—motifs of color, fracture, orchards, and sound are coherent rather than mixed, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. The key beats (kitchen memory, prototype’s near-match, dual-betrayal realization) are shown in precise, concrete language without therapy-speak or explanatory padding. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence, recharging earlier images.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid metaphors, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose mostly avoids purple excess despite a consistently metaphor-rich style, and images are coherent and reinforcing rather than mixed. Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, with good momentum through the central revelation. The figurative density is near-saturation in places; one or two simpler, harder lines at peak moments might make the key images hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (image, theme, and character) with little to no scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful, with metaphors (“bookmark…like a sleeping worm of memory,” “crown laid sideways, an upside-down throne”) that echo the story’s preoccupations rather than distract. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative lines and shorter, pointed ones, sustaining momentum in a reflective piece. The only arguable weakness is a slight saturation of imagery that might be trimmed for even sharper impact, but it doesn’t blur sense or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, avoid redundancy, and often do double-duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and largely unmuddled; images like “books sealed in clear plastic like organs in jars” or “a fight choreographer's map lets terror become timing” are fresh and legible. There are no obvious scaffold sentences, loops, or template cadences, and rhythm modulates effectively from long, meditative lines to tighter beats around key realizations. A slight tilt toward lushness keeps it out of the absolute top band but does not harm propulsion or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful (“ambered hush,” “shipwrecked constellations”) and doesn’t collapse into mixed-metaphor mush. There’s very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line either advances image, mood, or conceptual stakes. The density of metaphor occasionally edges toward excess, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied, dense, and largely free of redundancy, with metaphors that are both fresh and thematically apt (time folding “like a custodian turning a page”). Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; images reinforce one another instead of clashing. There are no visible scaffold phrases, loops, or mechanical cadences dragging momentum, and syntax remains clear even at the most lyric moments. The prose consistently advances character, setting, and concept simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) and the piece maintains momentum without scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is generally striking and coherent (“mouths half open underwater,” “eyes shining with unshed storms”). There is some density of metaphor in early paragraphs that edges toward purple, but it rarely clouds sense or causality. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with varied structures that support the evolving emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (world, character, theme) without slack. Imagery is vivid yet precise—“tiny storms caught in glass,” “hedges slumped like tired bureaucrats”—and avoids muddled or mixed metaphors. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, with no obvious loops, scaffolding, or filler. A few lines verge on ornate, but they remain legible and in-character, so they enrich rather than obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, concept, or character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent (“colors chased themselves backward,” “like cautious ghosts,” “like leaves in soft, underwater wind”) without collapsing into purple or mixed metaphor. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences, and sentence variety keeps momentum despite the reflective tone. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs (sky mechanic, icy warmth, sideways time) into a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, information-dense, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and mood) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent—“trapdoor,” “planets around a drowned sun,” and “standing inside someone else’s pulse” feel apt rather than decorative. There’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the prose maintains clarity even in its richest passages. A few lines flirt with purple, but none materially obscure sense or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor is mostly sharp (“green auroral sorrow,” “needles of an old barometer”), and nearly every line advances either atmosphere or character. The prose sustains a high figurative density without tipping into incoherence or redundancy, and there are no significant loops or scaffold sentences. Rhythm supports mood, slowing for reflection and tightening for key revelations. A few metaphors (“weight of a swallowed truth orbiting the room like invisible satellites”) come close to over-layering, but they remain legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied and musical, metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, and nearly every line carries multiple functions (setting, character, theme) without padding. The opening and closing images bookend the piece with resonant rhythm, and there are no significant redundancy loops or mechanical scaffolds. Figurative density is high (“tunnel breathes,” “flashlights yawning,” “carnival crown”) but not muddled; images remain legible and grounded. A slight tendency toward sustained lyric saturation in every beat keeps it just under the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often perform multiple functions at once (worldbuilding, mood, and thematic work) with few redundancies or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and on-theme, with images like "dust inhaled memories" and "air hummed with crumbling peace" enhancing rather than obscuring sense. At times the metaphor load approaches over-ornamentation, which slightly blurs immediacy and bodily grounding. Still, clarity and momentum survive the lyricism, and the final images read cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is controlled, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, concrete images that usually do more than one job (advancing setting, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and not so dense as to blur clarity; the central beats—moving residents, playing/stopping music, the final realization—remain crisp. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or line-level artifacts, and grammar and sequencing are clean. A few phrases edge toward lushness, but they don’t notably slow momentum or muddle the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences do multiple jobs (world, theme, character) with minimal scaffolding, and figurative language is fresh and coherent (“ink blurred into small storms,” “clocks lost faith and spun their hands in frantic prayer”). There are no noticeable loops or synonym churn; each image advances atmosphere or concept instead of repeating for effect. The rhythm supports the accumulative structure, with shorter clauses around key turns (“The sentence shook him…”) that sharpen impact. A handful of metaphors lean toward density, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; nearly every sentence does double duty in advancing world, mood, or theme. Figurative language (sheet music, light as curtain, sea listening) is rich but not so stacked as to blur clarity, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences. Syntax varies naturally and supports momentum, especially in the climb-and-reroute sequence. This is close to elite-line-level work; only a very light saturation of metaphor in places keeps it from pushing into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is tight: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and character) and the figurative language is largely fresh and coherent with the story’s sonic and theological preoccupations. There’s good rhythmic variation, with longer, meditative lines contrasted against sharper beats at key moves (“Let us try another word”). The density of metaphors and abstractions brushes close to purple in places, but remains controlled and legible; there are no noticeable synonym loops or scaffolding phrases. A slightly leaner middle—paring one or two explanatory lines about Jonas’s beliefs—could make the climax hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences are dense yet clear, often doing double duty for character and atmosphere (“each phrase lifting softly like steam from a pot no one could see” exemplifies this economy). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (horizons as questions, timelines like zippers, the baton’s “first downbeat”). There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum holds despite the reflective mode. The lushness may slightly risk saturation, but it never materially obscures sense or closure, which keeps it solidly high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is dense but mostly efficient, with images doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., droplets as lenses of divergent Lios). There is some stacking of figurative language, but metaphors are coherent and not contradictory, and the rhythm supports the lyric, speculative mode. No obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or mechanical cadences intrude, and the closure image is clean and sharp. A slight trim of a couple of near-redundant formulations could heighten momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense yet controlled: metaphors (“sleeping heart,” “ears bruised”) are largely fresh, coherent, and multi-functional, building atmosphere and character at once. Sentence-level rhythm shifts appropriately between longer, image-rich lines and tighter movement beats, so the piece rarely feels bogged down despite its lyricism. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; almost every line adds either a new facet of the world or a turn in emotional pressure. A few spots flirt with overpacked description, but they don’t obscure sense or blur the closing image, so line-level craft remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and purposeful, with metaphors that enrich rather than obscure (“a storm chart drawn in flesh instead of ink”). The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism—almost every line adds either world logic, character insight, or atmospheric pressure. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it clusters thematically (storms, mapping, surveillance) instead of drifting into purple excess. I see no real scaffolding, loops, or clarity issues that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: metaphors are mostly fresh (“lanterns trembling like captive moons,” condensation “glitter along her cheekbones”), and sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Rhythm varies well, with longer lyric sentences balanced by shorter, grounded beats at emotional peaks (“For the first time since the accident, he let the wave hit…”). There’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose maintains clarity even as it becomes more imagistic during the UV-revealing sequence. A few compounded coinages (“scentwisped”) and density of imagery could be trimmed for maximal sharpness, but they don’t significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is consistently high, with dense, multi-function imagery and almost no scaffolding or redundancy; sentences rarely restate without adding pressure or texture. Phrases like “as though lateness were a small, ethically playful sin against time” and “it refused to be background; it glared like a sentence waiting for its verb” demonstrate precision and originality. The figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than decorative clutter. A slight repetition of key abstractions (“texture of time,” “impossible choices”) is noticeable but doesn’t seriously blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush yet mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and inner state (“The chronic hush fattens around their footsteps…”). Metaphors are original and coherent—greenhouse as drowned cathedral, diving suits as ghosts, pumps that “hate finishing their cycles”—and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony despite the lyric mode. There is some density of imagery that edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or stall momentum. I see no significant loops or scaffold; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with images like “subtitles under an image” clarifying complex interior shifts. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; the piece moves forward sentence by sentence without slack. At times the prose edges toward lushness that could risk overshadowing action, but it remains legible and purposeful here.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with most sentences doing double duty for character and atmosphere, and very little dead scaffolding. Recurring phrases like “breezy library under stars” work as intentional motifs rather than redundant loops. Figurative language (“books towered like quiet guardians,” “tucking a seed into soil”) is controlled and coherent, supporting theme without purple excess. Line-level craft largely enhances momentum and clarity, though density is high enough that a more intense conflict might strain under it in a longer piece.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “figures that remembered rain” and “voices rose like tender graffiti on the cold air” are memorable without becoming muddled. Sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, characterization, mood) and rarely feel redundant or padded. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and tonally unified, avoiding mixed metaphors. The prose is lush, but momentum is maintained and the closure image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is finely tuned: high information density, varied syntax, and figurative language that is consistently apt (“the air tasted like old bells, like thunder heard from underwater”). There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding sentences, or metaphor tangles; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Rhythm modulates with narrative pressure—calmer glides through the canals versus knotted syntax when time is twisted—without sacrificing clarity. The lyricism is rich but controlled enough that momentum and legibility are never undermined.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong sentence-level variety and high information density—most lines carry worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, with minimal redundancy or mixed metaphors. The rhythm accelerates slightly around the spell and decelerates into the final image, matching emotional beats. One could argue for trimming an image or two for maximal tautness, but momentum and clarity remain intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, atmosphere) without evident padding, and the rhythm alternates long lyric lines with tighter, action-focused beats. Figurative language (“sediment of voices,” “texture of her need poured… like smoke”) is vivid and largely coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some repetition of constructions and favored adjectives, but it reads as controlled patterning rather than looped scaffold. Momentum remains intact across reflective moments; nothing crucial is summarized instead of dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, metaphors are mostly coherent, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Many lines do double duty for atmosphere and interiority, creating high information density. A few formulations (“reluctant metamorphosis pressing inside her, a sustaining transformation rather than a single strike”) flirt with abstraction and mild purple prose, but they remain intelligible and on-theme. Momentum holds across the reflective passages, which are well anchored in concrete stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is high-density and metaphor-rich, yet it largely avoids purple excess or muddled images; lines like “sleep had been a rumor to her” and “clouds hung low, gravid with more promises than rain” do multiple jobs efficiently. Sentence rhythms vary and maintain forward momentum despite lyricism. There is little visible scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every sentence either advances situation, character, or atmosphere. One could argue for a slight thinning of modifiers in places, but clarity and cadence remain strong throughout, including at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“bright darkness,” “lullaby sharpened by teeth”), and almost every line is doing double duty for mood and meaning. The density of figurative language is high, but it’s controlled and pattern-consistent rather than purple for its own sake. There are no evident loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity failures, and the final image of the pearl as a “second heart” is clean and strong. Minor risk of over-richness in a few stacked metaphors keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are sharp, metaphors coherent, and most sentences carry multiple weights (setting, theme, character) without bloat. Repetition (“staggered intervals,” fragments, absences) is patterned and meaningful rather than an artifact loop. Figurative language is dense but controlled, rarely tipping into overwrought; the rain/harbor/bone motifs stay aligned. A few sentences verge on conceptual explanation instead of image, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically do two or more jobs (world, mood, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and in-voice, with few, if any, mixed metaphors or redundancies; momentum rarely stalls. A couple of formulations flirt with abstraction (“things unsaid choose their tracks and hope no one follows”), but clarity and image-level coherence survive. Overall it’s near-publishable prose that could withstand only minor tightening rather than structural overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: images are striking yet controlled, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning (“Our lives folded through each other like pages, her fear and my doubt sharing a single spine”). Rhythm varies effectively; there’s little scaffolding, repetition, or filler. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, generally sticking to a sea/sky/mind cartography palette, so it doesn’t feel purple or muddled. A hair more restraint in places might sharpen a few already-strong lines, but there are no artifacts that impede clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, carrying worldbuilding and emotion together, and rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and legible, with only occasional risk of over-density that might mildly slow momentum. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase-loop; nearly every line earns its presence. The closing paragraphs, in particular, are clean and controlled, landing the conceptual turn without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is tight and varied, with high information density—most lines advance both atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and non-redundant; images seldom blur sense or stall momentum. There are almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and syntax shifts appropriately between longer reflective lines and punchier decisions. A couple of phrases (“liquefies rigid thinking,” “locked in numbers instead of words”) edge toward conceptual repetition, nudging the score down slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“mist threads through them like quiet handwriting”). There are no evident scaffold sentences, synonym loops, or muddled metaphors; figurative language is frequent but coherent and integrated. Momentum for this mode is well-managed: each sentence either elaborates the method, advances time, or deepens emotional/contextual charge. A few phrases (e.g., “incandescent restraint”) flirt with overt abstraction, but they’re rare and supported by surrounding concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs of setting, character, and theme (“He walked the aisles and layered sound over sight, rumor over rust”). Figurative language is vivid yet controlled, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler lines; nearly every sentence earns its place. A mild reliance on similar sentence openings (“He…”) is noticeable but reads as rhythmic design rather than artifact. The final lines land cleanly, with no figurative muddle to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do at least two jobs (image + theme, or action + interiority), and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high but deliberate and coherent (pages/whispers, resonance, negative space), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. Rhythm is varied, and the prose passes a read-aloud test without obvious template cadences or synonym churn. A few abstractions cluster near the thematic apex, but they don’t significantly blur clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and character (“I made a living as a culture shock absorber, guiding newcomers through the noise and neon tides”). Rhythm varies well, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language (investors as “slow, hungry sharks,” city districts shifting like “schools of fish”) is coherent and thematically apt rather than overgrown. A few lines verge on lyrical overload, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but disciplined: most sentences do dual or triple duty in character, world, and mood, with few if any scaffolding lines. Metaphors (“like a stranded iceberg against the velvet dark,” “dawnlit melancholy settled…like dust refusing to rise”) are vivid and coherent, not piled to the point of opacity. Syntax varies well, and there’s no noticeable repetition or looped phrasing that drags momentum. The only reason it doesn’t cross into 9+ is that the density of figurative language approaches the upper edge of what the length can comfortably sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is elegant: images are precise, metaphors generally coherent, and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme at once). Phrases like “slow, looping curls, like breath that refused to fade” and the chiming tubes painting “angles and densities inside his skull” exemplify controlled lyricism. There are no significant loops, scaffolding, or muddled figures, and momentum is maintained despite the contemplative mode. A slight density of metaphor in places keeps it just shy of the very top tier, but it never seriously obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense but precise: most sentences pull double duty with image and meaning (e.g., “quiet had started to feel like an accusation”). Figurative language is fresh and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or syntactic clutter, and paragraphing creates a smooth build from interior stillness to outward movement. There are no obvious scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences; the line-level work would mostly stand as-is in an elite venue. If anything, a single sentence or two could be pared, but the overall control is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the tonal register; only a few (“weighed moonlight in his hands”) flirt with over-lushness. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. The high figurative density in a relatively low-pressure narrative risks a touch of sameness, but it does not materially obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but controlled; almost every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, and I see no mixed metaphors that muddy comprehension. Momentum is sustained despite lyricism, in part because exposition is compressed and tied to concrete actions (drone launch, hatch override, alarms). A few lines brush the edge of purple, but they don’t materially blur cause/effect or undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent; the metaphors (bruise sky/sea, stacked mouths, hovering pages) deepen rather than muddy. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic tics that drag momentum, and clarity remains high even in dense passages. The only ceiling here is that the density of imagery may slightly slow forward drive for a top-tier market looking for maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density and images that usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined and coherent, and rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. A few lines verge on saturation (“grief braided with a sweetness too intense to bear”) and risk feeling slightly ornamental rather than pressure-driven, but they don’t materially obscure sense or momentum. There are no notable scaffolding loops, syntax errors, or clarity failures at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but generally controlled, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“Dust falls like flour onto his boots, and the canyon seems to listen…”). Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme, and there is little scaffolding or repetition; momentum is preserved despite the lyric mode. At times the modifiers and imagery (“orchid solace,” “pearl path”) verge on purple, and the saturation of figurative language could be trimmed slightly for maximal impact. Nonetheless, clarity and cadence remain strong throughout, including at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually doing double or triple duty (advancing setting, character, and theme together). Images like “bark twisting like cursive prayers” and “faith… like a root seeking water” are vivid, apt, and not overstacked; figurative language rarely feels strained. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm flows smoothly from image-driven description to quieter summary. One could argue the metaphor load is high, but it remains coherent and never obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but largely free of clutter: most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character, or image plus theme), and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels strained; images like names “leaking into the margins” or the post counter as a “hinge” are both clear and thematically apt. There are no obvious synonym loops or scaffold sentences; line-level control supports the accumulative mood rather than bogging it down. One could trim a handful of modifiers, but overall the craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, controlled rhythm, and largely original figurative language that fits the world (e.g., frost as “ghosts trying to remember their own stories”). The prose sustains lyric intensity without major redundancy or syntactic monotony, and nearly every sentence does double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is mild risk of over-saturation in metaphor and abstraction, but clarity and momentum remain intact, including at the closure beat. No obvious scaffolding, loops, or technical errors interfere with comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid but controlled imagery, and minimal redundancy; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (world-building, emotion, and theme) without feeling overstuffed. Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent—“letters… lost mid crossing of a sentence,” “like a tooth aching for rain,” “breathing green wounds that healed in moonlight”—supporting the language/regret motif. The prose borders on luxuriant, yet avoids real purple excess or figurative muddle, and syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. A few lines cluster abstractions (“every future balanced,” “the place where every apology still waits unspoken”), but they stay anchored to concrete visuals and do not drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that usually do two or three jobs at once (e.g., plants as civilians, coral as brain). Most metaphors are apt and thematically integrated, and there’s very little scaffolding or repetition. The prose flirts with over-density of figurative language in places but rarely tips into muddle, and causality remains clear even in the most lyrical passages. A touch more restraint or modulation in a few metaphor-heavy lines could sharpen impact further, but this is publishable-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tight, image-dense, and mostly free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Metaphors (exposed film, daydream fold, branches as ribs) are coherent and mutually reinforcing rather than mixed. There is a high figurative load, but it’s controlled and pattern-consistent, not arbitrary ornament, so momentum never stalls. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive publication, even if not utterly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and interiority) with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled and thematically unified around sound, reflection, and nested imagery, so it reads as patterned rather than purple. There are no noticeable loops or template cadences; momentum is maintained despite the lyricism, and the final lines land cleanly. A tiny number of metaphors (“arrangements of knowing”) lean abstract, but they do not materially blur sense or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and multi-tasking lines that simultaneously build world, character, and mood (e.g., beetles as “impatient typewriters”). Metaphoric richness is sustained without obvious mixed images or syntactic clutter, and sentences vary rhythm and structure effectively. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative—but momentum holds and clarity remains intact, including at the close. No substantial loops, scaffolding, or register slips interfere with the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously, with varied syntax and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is dense (“water was a heavy blue bruise,” “barnacles to coins”), but metaphors remain coherent and thematically apt rather than mixed. A few phrases slightly crowd the line (“via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind”), yet they don’t obscure sense or stall momentum. There’s little redundancy and the closure image is clean and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences work double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“the glass floors that remembered every step”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and sensical; images like “a thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret” and “seeds to fur” are vivid without obvious muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and syntax is varied enough to maintain momentum. The only real limitation is sheer density of metaphor in nearly every line, which may slightly blur sharpness at peak beats for an editor demanding maximal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually do double duty (worldbuilding + emotion) without bogging momentum. Metaphors like “shelves curved like fossilized ribs” and “the room stirred, attentive as a jury” are vivid and apt, with minimal mixed or overloaded figurative language. There’s little scaffolding or repetition, and the prose carries through to a clean, charged final line. It leans lush, but the control and clarity keep it out of purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but controlled, often doing double duty for setting, characterization, and theme. Metaphors (building breathing, magma as restrained fire, compassion encoded in gears) are coherent and extended rather than stacked randomly, and there’s little in the way of scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, rarely pausing on a purely ornamental image. A touch of figurative saturation prevents it from feeling utterly effortless, but it never descends into muddle or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, metaphors that generally cohere, and minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence advances either atmosphere or character. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and clearly musically motivated, so it reads as intentional style rather than gratuitous ornament. A couple of abstractions (“a withering promise that still bloomed,” “learning to trust again”) skim the edge of over-lyricism or summary, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final sentence is clean, concrete, and well-prepared by prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with metaphor yet rarely feels muddled or redundant; most lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Image systems stay coherent (weather, grain, thresholds, distance) without mixed or clashing metaphors. Rhythm and sentence variation maintain momentum, and crucial beats—doors opening, room tilting, the final distance—are rendered with crisp clarity. There’s no noticeable scaffold or synonym loop that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful: metaphors are fresh and coherent, and most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion or theme). Rhythm varies intelligently, with longer, sinuous descriptive lines balanced by shorter, crystallizing realizations that prevent bogging. There’s minimal redundancy; images like “harbor,” “constellations,” and “tides” are reused in ways that deepen rather than repeat. Even in the closing paragraph, there’s no figurative muddle or template cadence; the language stays clear while carrying high conceptual and emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, character, and theme together). Most metaphors are fresh and coherent with the established imagery system, and there is minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose edges toward very rich in places, risking saturation, but it never quite tips into muddle or self-indulgence. Rhythm and clarity remain intact through the closure paragraph, supporting rather than blurring the conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is musical and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“vending machines flickering like constellations trapped in glass, their hum a calculated wilderness of circuitry”). Syntax and sentence length vary enough to keep rhythm lively, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundant phrasing. The density of figurative language verges on over-rich in places, which slightly risks drawing attention to style over moment. Overall, though, clarity and momentum are maintained and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical yet precise, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Figurative language is dense but rarely tips into muddle; metaphors stay coherent with the watery, lunar lexicon. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every sentence pushes forward character, setting, or tension. Minor risk of over-richness in places does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level writing is polished and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“glass, too, is only sand convinced to stand still”; “clipboard wrapped in plastic as if the future could be protected with a sleeve”). There is some risk of metaphor stacking and abstract noun density (“noctilucent reckonings drawn in water, as if the sky's hidden lights were doing their accounting”) but it stops short of obscuring meaning or momentum. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal; transitions are smooth, and paragraphs feel necessary. The prose is slightly lush for the relatively modest plot, which may keep it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are mostly fresh (“embers drifting in reverse,” “dust motes…like tiny planets orbiting nothing”) and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for character and atmosphere. There is little to no scaffolding, repetition, or metaphor muddle; the prose flows cleanly. Rhythm shifts appropriately between long, sinuous reflections and shorter present-tense observations, preserving momentum. A couple of phrases lean into abstraction, but they don’t significantly cloud sense or weaken the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently strong, with rich but mostly disciplined figurative language (“the air felt like a held breath between worlds,” “waves braided the moonlight; inside, probabilities braided themselves”) that advances character and theme. Sentences are varied in length and structure, and almost every line is doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus interiority, or metaphor plus plot). There is a high density of metaphor, but it rarely feels redundant or muddy, and key beats (e.g., “Unlifted”) are stated with bracing simplicity. Minor risk of tonal lushness in a few academic abstractions, but they remain legible and voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (“pages charred at the edges like petals touched by frost,” “lectures rising like underwater bells”) without piling up into purple excess. There is minimal repetition or scaffold; almost every line advances mood, world, or situation. Minor density in a few metaphor-rich sentences does not impede clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and very little scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; metaphors stay within a consistent palette of light, water, sound, and time, avoiding muddle. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth cadence that suits the accumulative structure and does not obscure causality or the closing image. A slight tendency toward uniform lyricism keeps it just under the most rarefied level, but there are no artifacts that blunt the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually pull double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language—artillery as “old gods,” silence as a “wounded animal resting”—is vivid yet coherent, not piled to the point of purple. There’s little to no scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line earns its place and nudges character or atmosphere forward. The only minor constraint is that the uniformly lush register risks faint over-saturation in a few spots, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lush but disciplined: most sentences do double or triple duty in image, theme, and characterization without sliding into muddle. Metaphors are extended thoughtfully (cracks as scars, as map; tears as crystallized salt) and avoid contradiction, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies well between long, winding reflections and shorter, tightening lines near the conclusion (“I followed.”; “I followed.”; “I had taken the river; I had ended their migrations; I had edited them out of existence.”). The density is high, but clarity and momentum are preserved all the way through the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied, and information-dense, with most metaphors doing real conceptual work rather than serving as decorative flourishes. The repeated “silver courtyard under snow” and “between sigh and smile” motifs are purposeful rather than loop-like, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. While the prose occasionally edges toward lushness, it rarely tips into muddle; images remain legible, and momentum is maintained through clear syntactic progression. No significant grammatical or clarity issues interfere with the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and precise, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, psychology, and theme (“half-lit epiphanies hovered over the group, glow worms of insight that refused to land on anyone”). Rhythm varies effectively; there are no obvious scaffolding loops or template cadences. The metaphor load is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (dome/eye, meteor/orbit, fire/ink), with only the occasional risk of over-ornamentation. That slight excess—more than any real artifact—keeps this just shy of an absolutely pristine score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and figurative language that is largely coherent and purposeful. Metaphors (“the color of sunset remembered rather than seen,” “pattern like smoke trapped in parchment”) enhance rather than obscure sense. There is a near-constant lyricism that flirts with over-richness but maintains clarity and momentum, especially since the scene’s tempo is contemplative rather than frenetic. No major scaffolding or loops blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently high: images are fresh (“braided fibers punching invisible holes through the frozen air”; “snowmelt ardor”), and most sentences do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, emotion, and theme. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; the piece moves forward with each line, maintaining momentum despite its reflective mode. Figurative language is dense but coherent and thematically aligned with casting, ice, and sound, avoiding mixed or incoherent metaphors. The only restraint on a higher score is that the sheer saturation of imagery occasionally risks drawing attention to itself rather than the moment, even if it never fully tips into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, psychology, and mood) without redundancy. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“the frayed edge where choices rubbed themselves raw,” “alerts pulsed red,” “the first curious scouts of an invading army” for water) and rarely overstacked. Momentum remains intact despite reflection, in part because the reflective passages keep altering present stakes rather than looping. I see no significant scaffold, synonym churn, or clarity issues that would dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is dense but mostly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, voice, theme) without significant redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and on-theme, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose flows despite its richness. At times the figurative texture is nearly continuous, which risks slight over-lushness in a few spots, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Tightening a handful of most-ornate lines could raise the piece into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“the world had inhaled and forgotten how to breathe out”). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; most metaphors are coherent and apt for the emotional moment rather than stacked for ornament. There are no significant loops or scaffolding repeats, and the prose maintains clarity even as reality bends. A few abstractions (“resentment is clever”) skirt therapy-speak but are quickly grounded in concrete bodily detail, so they do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are clean, evocative, and information-dense without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified (glass, frost, breath, light), so it reads as patterned rather than purple. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through what is essentially a ritual, avoiding stagnation despite minimal overt action. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or clarity issues, and the final image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding; most sentences do double-duty for setting, character, and theme (“Risk, I learned, could grow like moss, soft until you tried to pull it free” is a prime example). Figurative language is consistent and coherent—stone, glass, roots, contracts, seasons—without mixed metaphors or density that muddies sense. There are no obvious synonym loops or template cadences, and the final beats land with clear, charged images (shimmering apple, rain of petals, “pale agreement”). A minimal trim of the more explicitly conceptual lines near the end could make the imagery sing even more by implication.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often doing double duty for atmosphere and concept without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically aligned (annotations as “guilty fireflies,” apples as miniature suns or closed eyes), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. Momentum holds despite the density because each image either builds the world-rules or advances Elias’s understanding; there are no obvious paraphrase loops or filler sentences. If anything, a tiny number of abstract phrases (“brightened disquiet”) could have been grounded in more embodied sensation, but they don’t materially dull clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy or bloat. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled, with recurring musical and botanical motifs that stay coherent and avoid mixed metaphors. Syntax varies smoothly, producing a readable cadence with no evident template loops or scaffolding phrases. The closing sentences are especially sharp, crystallizing both plot and theme without lapsing into abstraction or summary.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, theme, and character; images like “rust running backward like water” are striking without becoming opaque. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent, and there’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony. Occasional abstract phrases (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom”) are balanced by concrete anchors and do not significantly blur sense. Momentum holds smoothly through the lyric density, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely free of scaffolding; nearly every line carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and theme). Images like “a high nest of shadow and tick and breath” and “as if she herself were a diagram suddenly realizing it described a living system” are striking yet clear. Figurative language is frequent but controlled enough not to tip into purple, and there’s no evident looping or synonym churn. A touch of abstraction in mid-paragraph reflections could be tightened, but it doesn’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is consistently high: images are precise, multi-functional, and rarely redundant, with metaphors that cohere to the piece’s sonic and geological motifs. Syntax and paragraphing vary to sustain momentum, and even dense descriptive runs usually carry world-building, atmosphere, and character all at once. There is some risk of overload—nearly every sentence bears figurative weight—which could tire a reader at longer lengths, but here it mostly reads as lush rather than purple. Crucially, the climax remains clear and uncluttered, so the density never obscures cause or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, image-rich, and information-dense, and nearly every line does double duty for world, mood, and character. There is some risk of purple prose given the high metaphor frequency (“thistle-blown hope,” “salt flower,” “lightless flashes”), but the pattern is deliberate and legible rather than haphazard. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal, with no serious synonym loops or template cadences. A touch more spareness around the climax could heighten impact, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are dense yet clear, images fresh (“lightning… like silent heartbeats,” “parchment woven from cloud-silt”) and rarely redundant. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it builds a coherent atmospheric system around weather and memory without drifting into mixed metaphors. There are no visible scaffolding loops or syntactic monotony, and nearly every line advances either world-building, mood, or thematic weight. The only mild limitation is that the prose stays uniformly lush, with few strategic moments of starkness or abrasion that might heighten contrast at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied in structure and rhythm, dense with meaning, and rarely if ever redundant; many do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, characterization, and thematic work). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally consistent (light as grammar, knots as punctuation, fortress as a blooming organism). There are no meaningful loops or scaffolding lines that drag momentum, and the final image is sharp and uncluttered. The only restraint on a 9+ is the sheer saturation of metaphor, which is beautifully handled but leaves minimal contrast space for a sharper, cutting beat at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double duty, advancing both mood and character, and the metaphors (“time here was not a river but a shore”) are largely precise and grounded. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density; reflection is interleaved with present sensory detail so the scene never stalls. Figurative language is frequent but not haphazard, with recurring motifs (tides, husk/shed, mirrors) reinforcing one another rather than proliferating arbitrarily. A few moments tread close to over-explication or conceptual restatement, but they don’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished: figurative language is vivid and coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious padding. There are no significant loops or scaffolding lines; progression is steady and each paragraph adds a new facet. The density of imagery is high but remains legible and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors that cloud meaning. The final paragraph lands cleanly, recharging earlier images without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tightly controlled: most sentences carry multiple loads (world, mood, character) without redundancy, and the rhythm varies between longer lyrical lines and crisp, functional beats. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent (“soft as a dropped coin,” “tight noise of unspoken days”), avoiding mixed metaphors or syntactic clutter. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information flows clearly from one beat to another. A few phrases flirt with purple but don’t materially slow momentum or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid metaphor (“discarded sheet falling like autumn leaves of culture”), and purposeful syntax that generally advances both story and atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified around tech, time, and memory, avoiding mixed metaphors or obvious padding. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences; each line pays rent in either worldbuilding or pressure. The only limiting factor is that the density of imagery occasionally skirts purple, risking reader saturation in a few spots without quite tipping over.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty, imagery is fresh (“the sound went inward, not outward”), and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous descriptions balanced by shorter punch lines like “Breathe, he said, and the word arrived not as command but as space.” Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned—bridges, thresholds, breath, scars—with no mixed or strained comparisons that muddle sense. The density of figurative language approaches saturation in places, but clarity and momentum are preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is tight, dense, and purposeful: most sentences do more than one job (world-building, characterization, and mood at once). Figurative language is frequent but coherent, with images (promises as storms, letters crawling, polite accusation) reinforcing the concept rather than competing. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors that sap momentum, and the final sentence lands cleanly. Only the sheer density of imagery in a few spots risks slight overload, preventing a higher-9 score.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, character) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies well across the piece. Figurative language is rich but mostly disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple prose; metaphors around sound and resonance are thematically apt. There are almost no scaffold phrases or loops, and transitions between internal reflection and present action remain clear. The density of imagery edges toward lush, but it does not significantly slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are musical, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent (“eyes held constellations as small, steady wounds,” “factually mystical,” “glass veins breathing frost”) but usually precise and thematically linked rather than ornamental. The prose stays clear even in its lushness, and the final sentences land cleanly without metaphor muddle. A slight overabundance of metaphors in some stretches keeps it just short of truly exceptional minimalism under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is finely controlled: images like “praise that appeared like dandelions in a parking lot” or dust as a map of neglect are original and precise. Sentences carry multiple functions (character, atmosphere, theme) without bogging down, and there’s little to no redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors or purple-prose bloat obscure meaning. Rhythm and paragraphing create a smooth read that sustains momentum in a largely reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence adds either world texture, character pressure, or thematic charge, and metaphors are apt (e.g., histories scraped off “like gum”). The rhythm varies, avoiding template cadences, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding redundancies. Figurative density is high but mostly disciplined; repeated phrases like “auric lagoon under starlight” feel like deliberate motifs rather than padding. Clarity remains intact even in the more ornate passages, and the final image is sharp rather than smeared by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, world) without obvious scaffolding, and there are no significant loops or redundant restatements. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, with minimal drift into muddle or mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies well between long, flowing lines and more clipped cadences at the climax, supporting momentum. A few phrases (“mineral patience,” “mineral tears”) edge toward self-consciousness, nudging against—but not breaking—the restraint expected at the most elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is finely crafted: images are fresh (“leaves…spiraled inward like slow green comets”; “a word…then lost to shyness” rendered as a precarious seed monument) and most sentences do multiple jobs. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective, lyric mode. Figurative language is dense but coherent; metaphors tend not to mix or contradict, and diction remains thematically unified. Minor extravagances (“mossy delight tingling in veins”) do not materially obscure sense or dull the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and legible; images of water, metal, and plants recur with purpose rather than ornament. A few phrases flirt with familiarity (“age when coincidence becomes pattern,” “forgotten experiments”), and the figurative density could edge toward purple if extended, but here it remains controlled. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final line lands with clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is high: most sentences do double duty for image and theme, and there is very little slack or scaffolding. Metaphor density is intense (nearly every line carries an image), but the comparisons are largely coherent and legible, avoiding mixed or self-contradictory figures. Rhythm and paragraphing support the gradual build toward the crucible scene and release into the final step into night. The same lushness that’s a strength might be slightly trimmed in a top-tier venue for even cleaner thrust, which keeps this just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is dense, musical, and controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels mixed or muddled; images about sound, stone, and wind keep a coherent palette. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and shorter emphatic beats (“Mara barked a laugh, not cruel…”), giving the prose propulsion. It nudges toward ornateness in places, but without evident loops, scaffolding, or clarity loss, making it publish-ready at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied rhythm, and metaphors that mostly cohere and deepen sense rather than blur it. The prose flirts with excess but maintains clarity; images like “stained glass wounds” and “gallows taught quantum ethics” are striking without stacking into noise. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The only restraint from a higher score is the near-constant figurative pressure, which could, for some readers, risk saturation in such a short span.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but remarkably clean: images are original and coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without padding. There’s a consistent, deliberate rhythm and no obvious loops or scaffolding, and metaphors (e.g., “shard of heavy light,” “dense as a pocketed star”) are vivid yet legible. At times the language edges toward saturation of figurative texture, which slightly risks muting impact in the closing reflection. Overall, line-level craft is near–publish-ready for a high-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned (membrane vs. switch, beehive hum, facades cracking from the inside); it rarely feels ornamental. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the prose reads smoothly despite conceptual complexity. One could pare a couple of essay-like generalizations for even sharper momentum, but they don’t materially drag the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies in a way that supports the accumulative, magical tone. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and non-muddled, with only occasional mildly ornamental moments that don’t harm clarity. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or copy errors, and the closure image is sharp and memorable. A slight density of metaphors in some lines nudges against purple but never quite tips over, keeping this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: high information density, clean syntax, and images like “time thickened around her fingertips, swirling in pale bands suspended like smoke in syrup” that are rich but still legible. There is no noticeable scaffolding, repetition, or template cadence, and the rhythm supports the accumulative, reverent tone. The prose does push toward lushness in nearly every sentence, which risks saturation but mostly avoids genuine purple or muddled metaphor. A bit more sparseness at one or two pressure points could sharpen contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little redundancy or scaffolding, and rhythm varies gracefully between long, melodic lines and shorter emphatic beats. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and sensibly chosen for this world; metaphors like “Midnight came like a stone dropped into ink” are vivid without muddling action. There are no evident paraphrase loops or template cadences, and the final image (“the city loosen the breath it had forgotten holding”) cleanly resolves the accumulated tension. The density is high but never opaque, supporting momentum instead of stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences vary rhythmically, avoid scaffold, and usually do multiple jobs (advancing action, deepening character, and sharpening image simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few, if any, mixed or strained metaphors; the prose retains clarity even at its most lyrical. There’s minimal redundancy, and transitions between beats are clean and propulsive. A slight density in imagery might be pared for even sharper impact, but it doesn’t materially slow the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are clear, metaphors mostly coherent, and there’s minimal redundancy or padding; nearly every sentence pushes setting, mood, or idea. Phrases like “storm-tossed archway,” “turbine-hum reverie,” and “gatehouse that had forgotten which side was inside” show high information density with good sonic texture. There is a mild tendency toward consistent figurative flourish—especially in the final third where abstractions like “layered meanings” cluster—that risks slight overrichness and softens urgency. Still, clarity is never lost and momentum holds for this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions at once, and rarely waste space; phrases like “their corners curled like reluctant petals” are precise and vivid rather than generic. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled, with recurring lexicons of light, glass, and petals reinforcing theme without becoming muddled. There is a mild risk of purple prose in compounded images (“scent like ink and distant matches,” “her voice almost blue”), yet clarity never really suffers and there’s little redundancy. Momentum remains intact even in lush descriptive passages, so lyricism supports rather than stalls the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, metaphor is usually precise and thematically charged, and almost every line advances atmosphere, character, or premise. The density of figurative language skirts purple but rarely tips over; images like “courtroom sweating under fluorescent hum” and “page edges blackened like a cauterized wound” are both vivid and conceptually apt. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and transitions between beats are crisp. A hair more restraint in a few metaphor-stacked sentences could elevate clarity to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: images are sharp (“hulls knocking softly like teeth,” “shard lodged under the tongue”) and usually do multiple jobs (setting, mood, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or overwrought purple prose. There’s very little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence adds new nuance or pressure. The density is high enough that one might argue for a tiny trim in reflective phrases, but momentum and clarity remain intact through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and musical, with strong image-work (“the tower clock had not yet finished swallowing the hour,” “the wax ribbon curled softly...remembering the spiral”) and minimal redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies well, and almost every line pulls double duty for atmosphere and characterization. A few metaphors verge on saturation, but they don’t collapse into muddle or significantly slow momentum at this length. Overall, line-level craft is high and nearly publication-ready, with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-rich, and almost all do double duty in building world, mood, and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and internally coherent, with motifs of ice, seeds, time, and storms reinforcing each other rather than competing. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or register slips, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. A slight risk of over-saturation in metaphor is present but does not materially blur sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, images are generally fresh, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). The extended metaphors (storms as having “styles” or “listening back,” needles like a “throat clearing before a cry”) are apt and coherent within the piece’s logic. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; the prose maintains momentum despite its reflective density. A few lines flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t blur clarity or dull the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere, theme, and character. Metaphors are mostly fresh and coherent (“dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae,” “threads of molten silver…like thoughts before they learn their names”), and syntactic variety prevents drumbeat monotony. There is a high figurative load that skirts purple at moments, yet clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and characterization at once). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and coherent (“a bee that chose not to sting,” “dust motes into brief constellations”), avoiding mixed metaphors or excess clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances mood, image, or understanding. The register flirts with purple but remains controlled enough that clarity and momentum never suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, theme, mood) without padding. Metaphors like “algae of ages” and “yesterday could pool with tomorrow” are striking and coherent within the established logic; figurative language is frequent but not so stacked that it muddies sense. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, avoiding algorithmic repetition or scaffolding, and there’s little to no redundancy or explanatory tell. A few abstractions (“texture of time passing,” “anticipated mysteries”) lean toward essayistic, but they are anchored enough in concrete images to keep momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, theme) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm between long lyric lines and shorter, plainer ones is controlled. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and felt; images like “a loom forever throwing shuttles between broken colors” extend established motifs rather than clash with them. There are no visible scaffolding loops or mechanical cadences. A handful of lines verge on over-articulation of the abstract, but they do not materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense yet efficient; nearly every sentence advances world, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and patterned, with no mixed metaphors or muddled images, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is no visible scaffolding, redundancy, or explanatory padding; information density remains high without obscuring causality. The closing lines land cleanly and musically without purple excess, maintaining clarity of action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely balanced, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing scene, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and fresh (“fossilized pause in flight,” “numbers curling like spores”), and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. The line-level rhythm sustains momentum for a reflective piece, and grammar and punctuation are clean. A few moments edge toward ornate, but they remain legible and voice-justified, not purple to the point of obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, theme) with relatively little redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and stylistically unified, with no glaring mixed metaphors or opacity that blocks sense. There are a few slightly dense abstractions (“low language of salt and rust,” “map of desire”), yet they remain anchored in concrete action. The closing lines are clean, memorable, and free of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little redundancy, and metaphors are inventive yet coherent (“a rusted constellation,” “voice unfurled like smoke”). Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadences or scaffolding, and there are no significant clarity issues. Figurative density is high but controlled, enhancing rather than obscuring the emotional core. I see no meaningful loops or artifacts that drag momentum, especially across the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density: most sentences carry worldbuilding, atmosphere, and character simultaneously (“space looked both near and far, as if someone had folded the distance like paper without creasing it”). Metaphors are largely precise and thematically aligned with time and navigation, and rhythm varies well across the piece without falling into template cadences or loops. Line-level clarity remains high despite the lyricism; physical and temporal sequences are easy to follow. The only restraint on a higher score is that figurative density is consistently high and occasionally edges toward ornament, though it never materially muddies the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. A few images push toward purple (“throat full of prophecy,” “bruised colors”) but remain coherent and voice-justified rather than gratuitous. Momentum is preserved despite the lushness, in part because each sentence advances either emotional stakes or world texture. No loops or structural artifacts materially dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: figurative language is fresh, precise, and rarely over-stacked, with most sentences doing double duty for character and theme. There’s no evident scaffolding, synonym loops, or algorithmic cadence; the prose flows with momentum despite its lyric density. Metaphors like “morgue drawer for expendability” or “field medic of silences” are striking but still anchored in concrete situation. The final sentence cleanly ties sound, walking, and absence without blur, giving a crisp, memorable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is very strong: high information density, few if any scaffolding sentences, and metaphors that are controlled and thematically unified (books, pages, stone, thunder, burial). Rhythm varies well, with longer sinuous sentences early and slightly tighter ones around the stone and the speaking choice. The prose is lush but largely avoids purple excess or mixed metaphors; almost every sentence earns its presence. The only restraint on a higher score is the sheer density of imagery, which flirts with over-richness in places even if it doesn’t quite impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, dense, and multi-functional, usually advancing both atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful (“tower…like a captured lightning bolt,” “dust motes hanging like neglected pawns”), with few, if any, muddled metaphors. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line earns its place. The high lyric density flirts with overrichness but does not materially slow momentum or blur meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, metaphors are controlled (“forged hush,” “stacking causes and effects like bones”), and most images do multiple jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to muddle clarity, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose sustains momentum even while being ornate, especially through well-placed concrete details like “charcoal-smeared hands” and “circle of skulls arranged as stools.” A few metaphoric phrases lightly stack (“forged hush,” “cracked throat,” “breathlike vapors”), but they stay coherent within the bone/voice motif.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient: most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without devolving into deadweight. Metaphors are consistent in domain (acid, rust, lungs, cracks, script), avoiding mixed or contradictory images even at peak pressure. Repetition and parallel structures feel intentional, rhythmically supporting the accumulative, incantatory feel rather than signaling scaffold or loops. A few lines flirt with purple intensity, but they do not obscure causality or blur the closure image, so the overall line-level control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and vivid but coherent metaphors (“glass before the moment of breaking,” “stalagmites…like frozen waves”). There’s minimal redundancy, and nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The prose approaches purple at times, with imagery on almost every line, but the pattern feels intentional and controlled rather than indulgent. A touch more restraint or contrast in a few spots would move it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with varied sentence rhythms and a high rate of lines doing double duty for mood and narrative. Figurative language is generally coherent and earned, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. One line—“and it simply, quietly, purifies intentions”—shows a slight grammatical/tense stumble and reads more abstractly than the surrounding embodiment, a rare soft spot. Overall, line-level craft is very strong and nearly ready for top-tier publication with minimal polishing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is dense and musical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“We call it reverse migration, but names are just buoys…”). Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (roads, veins, tides, bones), rarely tipping into muddle or redundancy. There are no significant scaffolding loops or clunky transitions; rhythm varies and the final paragraph lands cleanly. A few lines hover near purple, yet they don’t obstruct clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but disciplined, with vivid metaphors that usually pull more than one weight (cables as “nervous ligaments,” storms as scars, the ravine as an eye socket) and a rhythmic variety that reads well aloud. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances world, theme, or emotional texture. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, and I didn’t find mixed or self-contradictory images that obscure meaning, including at the closure beat. A touch more spareness around the middle summary of their work might heighten momentum further, but overall the line-level craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: nearly every sentence carries multiple duties (image, tone, and character) without redundancy or obvious scaffolding. The figurative language is dense but coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors of sight, weight, and absence are consistent rather than mixed. There are no visible loops or template cadences, and syntax varies enough to keep the paragraph rhythm alive. It stops just short of overlushness, with clarity preserved even in its most ornate lines.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, imagistic, and generally high-information, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology (“stone thinned, turning not transparent but undecided”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent with the established world of maps, printing, water, and type. There’s little in the way of scaffold or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. It brushes close to purple in a few spots but never at the expense of clarity, especially in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are mostly sharp, and each line tends to carry multiple functions (atmosphere + character + stakes). The prose is lush but generally avoids muddled mixed metaphors; “the sky grew so near it felt like the inside of an enormous, listening ear” exemplifies precise, strange specificity. A few constructions verge on density/purple, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent rather than showy clutter. There is little scaffolding or repetition, and both the opening and closing lines land with real impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without feeling bloated, and the rhythm varies between long, sinuous lines and sharper beats in dialogue and turns. Figurative language is dense, but images are generally fresh, coherent, and aligned with the world’s physics and emotional logic (“light… folding along its spiral like a decision reconsidered at every turn”). There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence adds a new nuance or pressure, and the prose retains momentum despite its lyricism. If anything, a hair more spareness at peak-pressure moments might sharpen impact, but the current density doesn’t obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is consistently strong: high information density, very few wasted sentences, and metaphors that are fresh and legible rather than strained. Patterns like “ghost weather,” “frozen lightning,” and “fog with teeth” feel thematically integrated rather than purple for its own sake. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. The density of figurative language is high, and in a couple of spots it edges toward saturation, which slightly blunts impact and keeps this just shy of truly elite line-craft.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Imagery is consistent and controlled, centering water, fog, breath, and glass, with no mixed metaphors or purple excess despite the lyric mode. There are no evident scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; forward momentum is maintained even in reflective passages. The closing lines land cleanly, with strong but unlabored phrasing that leaves a resonant afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-by-line craft is strong: dense but purposeful images, minimal redundancy, and figurative language that remains coherent within the established metaphor system (ink, shards, weather, runes). Sentences do multiple jobs at once—worldbuilding, mood, and character interior—without obvious scaffolding, and there’s no significant synonym-churn or template cadence. The prose skirts the edge of lushness but largely avoids purple excess because each metaphor earns its keep in theme and atmosphere. The closure beat is particularly clean and potent, with “an inkwell of weather” efficiently recharging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and most metaphors are pointed and legible (“You sold thunder as jewelry” is both image and accusation). The piece balances lyricism with clarity; description almost always does double duty for mood and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundant restatement. At times, the density of figurative language flirts with overload, especially in the midsection where currents and metaphors reflect each other, but it doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. Trimming one or two metaphorical flourishes in that band could sharpen impact without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally precise, with metaphors that align (“definitions curling and uncurling like shy animals,” “galaxies…like a sentence rewritten with stricter punctuation”). There is minimal redundancy, and most lines do more than one job, advancing setting, mood, and concept simultaneously. The prose occasionally edges toward abstraction, but not enough to blur causality or the closure image. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum in what is essentially a lyric, conceptual ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences carry multiple layers (action, setting, theme) without bloat, and rhythm varies purposefully. Metaphors are original yet coherent with the piece’s water/measurement lexicon; there is no evident mixing or purple excess that obscures sense. There are no noticeable scaffolds, loops, or filler phrases; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or conceptual stakes. The opening and closing images echo each other with tight, controlled diction (“water thinking about falling” / “unwinding sea”).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors like “quiet wildfire” and “standing in front of a mirror that refused to be only glass” are vivid and coherent with the established lexicon. The prose edges toward high density of figurative language but remains controlled; it does not drift into muddle or repetitive loops. There are no notable artifacts, redundancies, or clarity problems that dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, images are fresh, and most lines do multiple jobs (character, setting, and theme) without bloat. Figurative language is dense but coherent and pattern-consistent (“blurred guardians,” “trembling rectangle of clouded light,” “numeric readouts…like bad lecture notes”), never collapsing into mixed metaphors. There’s virtually no scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony, and the prose accelerates or lingers in sync with emotional beats. The final sentence is a clean, resonant cadence that reweights earlier clover and rain imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, almost every line carries multiple functions (image, mood, theme), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; images like “room with no doors” and “thin electric pause” feel precise rather than generic. The density does verge on lush enough that a few metaphors feel ornamental rather than strictly necessary, which slightly blurs momentum in places. Still, clarity never suffers, and the final paragraphs land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense but highly controlled: metaphors are fresh, internally consistent, and multi-functional, rarely feeling gratuitous (“barnacle roses,” “sea curled upward like a page being turned”). Sentences vary in structure and length, creating a persuasive rhythm that carries momentum despite the lyric mode. There’s no evident synonym-churn, scaffold, or explanatory redundancy; nearly every line either advances atmosphere, character, or the accumulating ritual logic. The final sentence elegantly braids motif and theme without bloating, providing a clean auditory and conceptual cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and frequently do double duty for worldbuilding and tone without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors are mostly fresh and apt (“weight of a confession,” “stalled prayers”) and rarely feel mixed, maintaining clarity even in lyric stretches. There are no evident loops, redundancies, or mechanical cadences; the prose flows with good momentum for a mostly static physical scene. A minor caveat is that figurative density is high enough that one or two images could be trimmed to let key moments breathe, but this is a refinement issue rather than a structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, and forward motion) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and pattern-consistent—sound and cartography metaphors reinforce one another instead of clashing. Rhythm varies nicely between long, accumulative lines and shorter, punchier clarifications, especially toward the ending. A very light trim of a few slightly over-packed metaphors could sharpen momentum further, but clarity and cadence are already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally tight: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, and theme) without feeling crowded. Figurative language is frequent but clean and coherent, with recurring metaphors of seeds, curves, and grain binding the piece rather than becoming purple or mixed. There are no noticeable scaffolding loops or template cadences; rhythm varies naturally. The closing lines in particular are precise and resonant without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and dense with meaning, and almost every line does double duty (worldbuilding + character + theme). Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-controlled, with only a few phrases flirting with overrichness without tipping into muddle. There are no notable clarity issues, loops, or scaffolding artifacts, and the final image is crisp. An ultra-demanding editor might trim one or two metaphors for austerity, but the prose is already at a high literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied and musical, images are generally clean and multi-functional, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly purposeful—ash, fire, and wounds recur in ways that deepen rather than clutter the texture. Key beats (the self-portrait, the tapestry revelation, the final resolve) are rendered with clarity and momentum; nothing crucial is buried or overwritten. A few metaphors flirt with density (“portray a language of endings,” “volcanic tenderness”) but remain coherent, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, with figurative language that is generally precise and thematically aligned. The recurring sound/light metaphors and tactile details do multi-layered work without obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences. The density of imagery is very high, verging on purple in a few spots, but the pattern is taught early and sustained, so it reads as intentional lyric intensity rather than clutter. Minor trimming in one or two lines could increase sharpness, but there are no artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight, image-rich, and largely free of redundancy; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, mood) without bogging down. Metaphors are generally apt and consistent with the world’s logic, and there’s good variation in sentence length and structure. A few lines approach density that could feel slightly ornamental (“a ribbon of intention curling through steel canyons”), but they don’t derail clarity or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is well above average and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level work is highly polished: images are striking yet coherent (“water held the color of bruised glass,” “flickering crescent moons along the ceiling”) and carry both mood and information. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, with almost no scaffolding, redundancy, or mechanical patterns. Figurative language is frequent but largely disciplined around a few motifs (water, light, teeth, secrets) rather than scattershot metaphor. At times it comes close to purple, but the density serves the lyric, accumulative design and does not obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (advancing plot while building mood or motif). Figurative language (“hush where past meets prophecy,” “forests of second thoughts”) is rich but coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; most lines feel necessary. At times the prose edges toward lushness, but it never seriously slows momentum or blurs sense.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do at least two jobs (image + theme, or action + emotion), and the rhythm is varied and intentional. Metaphors are generally precise and thematically aligned (“cage lined with cushions,” “breathing dark of the sublittoral fringe”), with no real muddle or mixed vehicles. A few lines edge toward luxuriance, but they don’t stall momentum or obscure meaning. There’s essentially no scaffold, redundancy, or visible artifact, which supports the strong closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is tightly crafted: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with vivid yet precise imagery (“each curl of wood falling like a quiet syllable”). Rhythm and syntax vary in a way that suits the accumulative, hushed pressure, and there are no notable loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles. Metaphors (turbines as skeletons, laughter as a gym exercise, the hush built from shavings and tea) feel coherent and earned. It’s publish-ready line work, just a notch below the rarest tier of mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, figurative language is largely coherent and thematically unified (stone/body, sound/throat, weather/language), and there’s minimal scaffold or repetition. Information density is high—most lines do at least two jobs (image + worldbuilding, or memory + theme) without feeling padded. A few metaphors edge toward richness-on-richness (“smoke rose like punctuation stripped of meaning”) but remain legible and purposeful rather than muddled. Momentum holds across the piece despite its lyric mode, and the final sentence lands cleanly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: almost every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are striking yet coherent (“where light hesitated before choosing a side,” “his face a map of tiny hesitations”) and avoid muddle or mixed vehicles. There are no obvious loops, template cadences, or filter stacks, and the closure image is clean and memorable. The density of figurative language is high but remains controlled, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding; most lines advance both atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with few, if any, mixed or strained metaphors, and the rhythm modulates well between longer lyric sentences and shorter, sharper beats (“Tonight, alone with the dust motes, she was not sure”). Information is efficiently embedded into images (e.g., “a siren failed to wail” carries world, tone, and theme at once). Minor issues—a fragmentary question punctuation and the occasional near-purple flourish—do little to harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“a dome that pretended the sky still moved,” “a chandelier of ghosts”). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous description and tighter, declarative lines near crucial realizations, giving the piece momentum despite its lyric mode. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, and there are no real loops or scaffolding sentences. At times the sustained metaphorical richness edges toward saturation, slightly risking overshadowing immediate feeling, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: imagery like “cables dangled like ivy” and “water beaded and traveled the glass like cautious comets” is vivid without becoming overwrought, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). There are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases, and the closing cadence elegantly recharges earlier motifs (tape, maps, sideways growth). A few expository clarifications about her project could be tightened, but they don’t significantly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is exceptionally polished, dense with images that usually do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme), and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences read cleanly and carry strong momentum; each line advances atmosphere or Hiran’s internal escalation. The main limitation is a persistent high-metaphor density that edges toward purple in places, which could slightly blunt impact if sustained, though here it remains legible and purposeful. No obvious mechanical or clarity issues mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, atmosphere, emotion) without redundancy, and there are few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and coherent (“sky bruised violet,” “brightness poured out of them and lost,” “like grief that had forgotten why it started”). Rhythm supports the accumulating pressure toward the climax and softens into the charged final lines. A couple of metaphors echo familiar patterns, but they do not obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in length and structure, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language (“like a held breath stretched between future and past,” “voice rough as river stones”) is vivid yet coherent, rarely straying into purple or mixed metaphor. There’s virtually no redundancy or template cadence, and the final image (fox and internal gate) lands crisply. The prose is lush but disciplined enough to sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and multi-tasking images—coffee rings as both literal and cosmological craters, for instance. Metaphor is frequent but generally coherent and character-grounded, avoiding mixed or confusing comparisons. There is minimal redundancy; most sentences either advance image, theme, or emotional state. The closing cadence is clean and resonant, with no scaffolding or clumsy exposition dulling the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most lines carry atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and thematically aligned (film, hearts, storms), passing the read-aloud and coherence tests. There’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum. A few metaphoric clusters (“secret egg,” “hushed thunder,” “lighthouse in fog”) come close to saturation, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do double duty for world and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and legible (“ink suspended in water,” “gears made of memory instead of metal”), and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. A couple of metaphors (“careful bruise,” “shadowed rapture”) flirt with lushness but are anchored enough in context not to blur sense. Momentum is maintained despite the lyric density, carrying cleanly into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense but controlled: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent in lexicon (trains, ash, light, wave functions, lullabies) and rarely feels mixed or strained; images extend one another instead of competing. Syntax and paragraphing create a clear, propulsive rhythm for a lyric piece, and the final third remains crisp and legible despite heightened abstraction. I see no technical errors, and the prosody of key lines (“Each collapse is a cradle snapping shut, a lullaby losing one more missing note”) supports the emotional and conceptual peak rather than smothering it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, concrete images, and sentences that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt—the unraveling sweater, the forest as a “listening ear,” the heartlike piston—without crowding each other. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or filler. The density of figurative language edges toward lush, but clarity and momentum remain intact, so it reads as intentional texture rather than purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, and most images do double duty for mood and theme (“twilight had deepened into a purple so thick it felt like walking inside a bruise”). Metaphors cluster around water, fog, and leashes in a coherent field, avoiding mixed or clashing vehicles. There is some density of figurative language, but it rarely feels like padding or loops, and clarity is consistently preserved. Minor trims could tighten a few slightly overworked phrases, yet the prose largely propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are dense with meaning yet clear, with minimal redundancy and no visible scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but not muddled; images stay within a coherent sensory and conceptual palette (snow, stone, sound, injury). Syntax and paragraphing manage momentum well, quickening around key turns (“Enough,” the cracking stone) without losing legibility. There are no grammatical slips or clunky constructions that obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, multi-functional, and generally free of scaffolding or paraphrase loops; images like “books… like fish through a broken net” are striking yet apt. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or obscured sense. There’s minor risk of saturation—for some readers, nearly every line carries a metaphor—but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum or blur causality. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the opening and closing lines both work hard, setting and then recharging tone and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: images are vivid yet controlled, with most metaphors doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“contrails are already ghosts,” “paper…with the stubbornness of an old scar”). Sentences vary in length and structure, giving the prose a natural cadence that supports the accumulative pressure without drag. There are a few spots of density where figurative language stacks, but they remain legible and do not blur causality or the closure image. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal; nearly every line advances character, world, or the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful: most sentences carry at least two jobs (image plus psychology or worldbuilding plus mood). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded; there’s little in the way of synonym churn, padding, or explanatory scaffolding. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative lines and sharper, declarative ones; the closing paragraph, in particular, lands cleanly and without purple overreach. A few abstractions around “meaning” and “coherence” could be trimmed or concretized, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character (“shackles woven from expectations and probabilities” is both political critique and science-fictional detail). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; metaphors extend a clear organic-volcanic lexicon rather than drifting into mixed or purple territory. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric richness. At times the density slightly smooths over micro-beats of emotion that might benefit from plainer phrasing, but clarity and propulsion never truly suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is tight, image-dense, and purposeful; most sentences do more than one job (advancing atmosphere, theme, and character at once) without obvious padding. Metaphors are controlled and coherent—the plants leaning toward an absent lighthouse, memory as smoke under a door, truths as rocks in the tide—and they remain legible. There are no evident paraphrase loops or template cadences, and syntax maintains clarity despite lyricism. If anything, the figurative density edges toward maximal in places, but it never muddies causality or dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines serving atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., “daylight…painted the dust with a luminescent ache”). Sentence rhythm varies and generally propels rather than stalls, and metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme (threads, tides, lenses, cards). However, figurative density is consistently high, edging into purple in places and occasionally restating the same idea (fragmented reality, misfiled books) with near-synonymous imagery. A slight pruning of redundancies and one or two overworked metaphors would bring it into top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “bruised memory of the eclipse” in the ink). The figurative density is high but rarely feels purple or muddled; metaphor chains generally cohere and stay within the story’s sensory and conceptual palette. There’s little redundancy or scaffold, and exposition about the Crisis Slow and the ink is concise and embedded in scene. A few lines edge toward abstraction, but they do not significantly slow momentum or obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do double duty with atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“machines that dreamed,” “smothered possibility,” “stack in rows and freeze”) is controlled and coherent, avoiding muddled or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum carries through the ethical crux to the quietly charged ending. One could arguably trim a few abstract formulations in the middle for even sharper propulsion, but they don’t materially dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet purposeful, frequently doing double duty (worldbuilding plus character, or theme plus action) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (memory as grafting, sheathing as composting), and the rhythm reads well aloud. The prose does flirt with high-density figurative language throughout, which may slightly soften local impact in places that could benefit from a plainer punch. Still, clarity is never lost and the final paragraphs land cleanly, with no noticeable loops or artifacts dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is lush but mostly precise; metaphors are coherent with the established physics of this surreal world and generally multitask (worldbuilding plus emotion). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; nearly every sentence adds a facet of character, setting, or forward motion. The risk of metaphor saturation (“where water rose and fell in rippling chords…every droplet suspended like a note on a staff”) is managed well enough that clarity and closure remain intact. A tiny trim of overlapping musical/sea imagery might make the piece even sharper, but it’s currently publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for image and theme; there’s minimal scaffold or redundancy. Metaphors like “stones in water,” “arrowhead pointing backward,” and “orbit of regret” stay consistent with the story’s conceptual field and don’t tangle. A few lines verge on ornate, but they remain clear and voiced rather than generic purple prose. The momentum never stalls in exposition, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double or triple duty in worldbuilding, emotion, and forward motion, and the rhythm varies well between lush description and clipped, pressured beats. Figurative language is rich but controlled, with motifs (tape, meteor trails, trapped insects, compression) cohering around a clear aesthetic. There are no real loops or scaffolding sentences; the piece reads as tightly edited. The only constraint on an even higher score is that in a few spots the stacked imagery (“clock…hands blurred into a shining disc,” “building is being tethered”) slightly saturates the line without further tightening the immediate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously, with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned (erasure, smudging, patterns), and does not tangle into mixed metaphors. Momentum never stalls despite the lyric texture; the piece moves steadily from arrival through discovery to action. There is minor risk of overload for readers who prefer sparer styles, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet purposeful: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept (“like standing between a flame and its smoke” is a strong, clarifying simile). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; rhythm and paragraphing support a smooth build toward the ritual and its aftermath. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and non-mixed, avoiding purple excess. A few abstractions (“retro­cognitively trapped,” “metallic tension”) momentarily cool the immediacy, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and character (“a figure made of footlights and dust motes” is exemplary). Sensory layering is rich and mostly coherent; synesthetic metaphors build a pattern rather than becoming random ornament. There is mild risk of over-dense figurative language in a few spots, but momentum and clarity never truly stall, and there’s little to no scaffolding or looped paraphrase. Line-level control is publication-ready with only slight tightening possible for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is high: vivid metaphors (“cobwebs of possible choices,” “willowglass hope”) usually land cleanly and are meaningfully tethered to the story’s motifs. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, emotion, and momentum—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The prose occasionally approaches lushness, but the pattern is consistent and legible, not purple or confusing. There are no noticeable loops, syntax glitches, or figurative muddles that sap the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and deliberate, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs in worldbuilding, atmosphere, and character. Metaphors (“ceiling arched like the ribs of an ancient whale,” “slow, silent auroras”) are apt and not over-stacked, and I don’t see paraphrase loops or filler scaffolding. The rhythm is varied enough to keep momentum in what is essentially a meditative exploration. The only small curb is that the line-level density sometimes slightly softens a sense of urgency, but it doesn’t harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are largely fresh and coherent, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or plot plus theme). The figurative density is high but generally controlled, and metaphors are internally consistent rather than mixed. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the prose propels us through a non-action-heavy scene without bogging down. A very small risk is the cumulative lushness flirting with purple in places, but clarity and momentum are not materially harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and coherent; metaphors like “silver hush” and “mechanical whale” are striking without becoming purple. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax supports momentum through the quiet investigation and realization. A very small handful of lines verge on abstraction, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is notably strong: images are fresh, precise, and multi-functional, and most sentences carry more than one layer of work (atmosphere plus character insight, or setting plus theme). The prose flirts with density but rarely tips into purple; metaphors like “the way fog feels the shape of everything it touches” and “a living palimpsest promise” are both clear and thematically apt. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the rhythm supports the story’s quiet escalation. A touch of high lyricism occasionally risks over-saturation, which is the only factor keeping this out of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, theme, interiority) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and metaphors are generally coherent and apt. Repetition—e.g., “phototropic to kindness”—is purposeful rather than looped, reinforcing the conceptual frame. The prose occasionally nears density saturation with imagery, but it remains legible and doesn’t obscure causality or cadence at the close. There are no glaring artifacts, syntactic monotony, or mixed metaphors dulling the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with dense yet generally controlled imagery (“masts write faint calligraphy against the sky,” “low-slung constellation”) that often does double duty for setting and theme. Momentum is sustained despite lyricism; there are few, if any, true paraphrase loops, and most sentences earn their place. A slight risk of over-saturation in figurative language is present, but it rarely muddies clarity or undercuts the closure beat. The final paragraphs, in particular, balance image and sense with notable precision.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, tight, and usually do multiple jobs (world, mood, and theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with clear imagistic logic and no mixed metaphors that obscure sense. There’s virtually no scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and the prose moves forward with good momentum for such a reflective piece. A few abstractions (“translate isolation into independence,” “arrangement of time itself”) lean theoretical, but they’re anchored enough in concrete images to avoid real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding and little repetition. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and metaphors cohere around birds, water, thread, and architecture with no major muddles. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous observations and shorter, declarative pivots, especially near the ending. There’s mild risk of density overload in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: sentences are varied, dense, and often do double duty with image and information. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, staying in the aural/electrical/cosmic lexicon without mixing metaphors. There’s no evident scaffold, repetition loops, or clarity breaks; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. The prose is lush enough that in a longer piece it might risk over-saturation, but at this length it maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, metaphors are vivid yet coherent, and nearly every line carries multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character). The figurative language is frequent but generally precise and purposeful; phrases like “walls shivering nearer in imagination” and “walking inside someone’s slow, reluctant sigh” are fresh rather than purple. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding, and momentum holds even through reflective moments. The density of imagery in places lightly brushes up against excess but does not meaningfully impede clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, purposeful metaphors, and high information density with minimal scaffolding. Phrases like “furrowed hush” and “armored hide of a conscience” flirt with lushness but retain coherence and avoid mixed imagery. There’s very little redundancy, and exposition is folded into scene rather than summarized in lumps. The prose sustains momentum despite its reflective bent, making this feel polished and near-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is tight: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without redundancy, and the rhythm varies well across the piece. Figurative language is dense but controlled; images are coherent and tonally aligned with wet decay and bureaucratic erasure rather than showy for its own sake. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that drag momentum, and the closing sentences land with clarity and charge. A few metaphors verge on rich ornament, but they don’t blur sense or undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, deepening character, and sustaining atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; motifs of bridges, maps, and pixels interlock instead of competing, and there are few if any mixed metaphors or redundant scaffolding lines. Rhythm modulates with the scene’s emotional arc, avoiding monotony or info-dump digressions. At times the abstraction (“sculpting possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) flirts with purple, but context and payoff keep it from obscuring clarity or dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is mostly precise and purposeful, and information density is high without obvious padding. Recurrent images (rust, tracks, roads, borders, money) deepen rather than repeat, and there’s little paraphrase looping. A few metaphors (“dusky harmony,” “polished calm”) verge on the ornate, but they remain coherent within the established lyric register. Overall, the prose would not require more than minor tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally apt and coherent, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “clocks surrendered to midnight” and “inscriptions shimmering like breath on glass” feel precise rather than overblown, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. The density of figurative language flirts with lushness but never quite tips into opacity, and sequence of actions and ideas remains clear. There are no noticeable grammatical slips or structural artifacts that interfere with momentum or the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but controlled: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without slipping into obvious redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet largely coherent and thematically aligned (water, glass, roots, fruit, hunger), and the read-aloud rhythm flows. Key beats—his hand on the ice, the seed’s introduction, the final whispered reversal—are clearly rendered and propel momentum. The main constraint on a higher score is that the near-every-line metaphorical texture flirts with purple in places, occasionally risking saturation without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is dense but purposeful: images like “air tasted like rain that never fell” and “trains that folded like paper cranes” carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without devolving into purple mush. Syntax varies, pacing the reveal of information and emotional pressure effectively. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and non-redundant; there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts that slow momentum. A handful of metaphors verge on richness-for-its-own-sake, but they don’t obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly efficient: most sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) without obvious redundancy, and imagery rarely feels gratuitous. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (ribs of temples, moth-eaten soul, altar as mouth), and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts, and syntax remains clear even at peak lyricism. A handful of lines verge on lushness that could, in a stricter market, be pared slightly, but they do not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is taut, evocative, and mostly free of scaffolding or redundancy; sentences typically do double duty for character and atmosphere. Figures like the quarry’s echo and the silence “after the applause” are clear and thematically aligned rather than showy. A few lines skate close to abstraction (“Loss…was only a misalignment of expectations and reality”) and the last sentence tells what the preceding image already implies, slightly dulling the close. Still, rhythm and clarity are strong throughout, easily at or near publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is dense but purposeful: metaphors (standing wave, patterns becoming winds, chrysalis/translation analogies) are mostly clean and mutually reinforcing. Information density is high without serious redundancy, and each paragraph advances either situation, world rules, or Mara’s internal recalibration. There is a light risk of piling abstractions (“physics of transition,” “grammar of fields and absence”) but they remain palpable enough not to blur momentum. No notable artifacts, loops, or clarity failures impact the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but purposeful: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious padding, and metaphors are striking yet legible (“names wax and wane like tides against the mind”). Rhythm varies well between long, baroque lines and shorter, more direct ones at key beats (e.g., the fisherman’s question). There is a high frequency of figurative language, but it stays coherent within the marine/time/metal palette, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. Only occasionally does the density risk softening immediacy, but it never obscures causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, carry multiple functions (image, theme, character), and maintain clarity despite the lyric density. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and patterned (radiance, crowns, shells, listening stone) rather than haphazard; it never obscures basic sense. There are minor redundancies (“acquired abandoned hopes” appears twice, “latent radiance” echoes) but they read as intentional motif rather than loop. Tightening a few slightly abstract tags would move this comfortably into elite-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually do multiple jobs at once (the taped bellows as both object and lung-like persistence). Figurative language is frequent but disciplined; metaphors are tight and legible, and there’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping. Pivotal images—the graffiti line, the accordion’s hoarse wheeze, the final ordinary wave—are sharply rendered without muddle. A few formulations (“daringly methodical way to avoid looking directly at myself”) are slightly more abstract/essayistic than the surrounding texture, preventing a full 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently high-level: dense images that usually do double duty, clean syntax, and no obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Patterns like “library in mist,” the watch’s seesaw ticking, and the recurring letters accrue meaning without feeling repetitive. Even at high metaphor density, clarity of action and thought is maintained, and the final image (ink fogging away beneath a lantern-book) lands crisply. The only slight drawback is that nearly every line reaches for figurative weight, which risks saturation; a touch more plainer texture could make the peaks stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong, with varied rhythms and images that usually pull double duty for mood and theme (“as transparent as a lie repeated until nobody could see through it anymore”). Figurative language is frequent but not random; most metaphors are precise and character-inflected, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines flirt with purple or overextension, yet they do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final crack and drop are simple and clean, giving a satisfying rhythmic and imagistic cadence to the denser preceding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but controlled; most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and mood without obvious loops or filler. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and tonally unified, and syntactic variety keeps the lyricism from congealing into sludge. There are no mixed metaphors or notable clarity slips, even in the more ornate lines. A ruthless editor might trim a handful of modifiers, but nothing at line level significantly drags momentum or muddies the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for image and theme, with very few wasted words. Figurative density is high but largely coherent and non-redundant; images (scallops, vines, trees, clouds) recur with evolving weight instead of as ornament. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and syntax varies enough to keep rhythm alive. A slight risk of over-lyricism in places keeps this just shy of the very top band, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and there is little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent (glass, light, wind, doubt); it reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than purple drift. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative lines and sharper beats (“She laughs once, sharp as cracked glass”). A few phrases (“sincerely insincere,” used twice) edge toward self-conscious patterning, but they do not meaningfully dull impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are lean yet dense, often doing double duty for image and theme, and the rhythm modulates well between incantatory and precise. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent (“slower than rust, slower than apology”; “like ink washed again and again”). There is little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the closure image is sharp and uncluttered. A couple of abstractions (“the shape of a self”) flirt with vagueness but are immediately grounded by sensory or situational context, preserving momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are precise, sentences are purposeful, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Extended figurative language (“A tool…was a sentence the past tried to finish in the future”; “a weather of memory”) is generally coherent and supports theme. The prose does flirt with density—many consecutive metaphor-rich lines—but avoids true purple by keeping physical anchors present. This lushness slightly risks saturation but does not materially obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, information-dense, and generally multi-functional—lines often advance character, world, and mood simultaneously (“the clouds pulsed faintly with cityglow from far below, a distant, automated aurora”). Metaphors are striking and mostly disciplined; they elaborate rather than obscure (“brilliant dimness,” “the spire creaked like an old lung”). There is minimal scaffold or repetition and the syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive. If anything, the density of figurative language flirts with overrichness in a few spots, but it does not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (image, mood, motion), and rarely loop or restate. The figurative language is dense but mostly clear and purposeful, sustaining the underwater-lantern, vow-library conceit. There are no major artifacts, grammar slips, or muddled metaphors; causality and image order stay legible. The only limiting factor is occasional near-saturation of similes/metaphors in succession, which could be pruned slightly for maximal sharpness in an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with strong rhythm and rich metaphors that generally clarify rather than obscure (“a dark ocean waiting to decide whether to inhale again”). Information density is high; most sentences advance both atmosphere and theme, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language pushes toward the ornate in places, which a very strict editor might trim, but it doesn’t create real confusion or momentum drag. Mechanics are clean, and the final line lands with a precise, charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but efficient; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or image plus mechanics) and there is little to no scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with recurring vehicles (echo, light, constellations, salt) that build a consistent texture instead of clashing metaphors. Momentum holds despite lyricism; the ritual sequence reads clearly and the closure image is crisp. The only minor limit is that nearly every line is “turned up,” leaving little contrast between plain and heightened diction, but clarity never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies in step with the scene’s calm and intensification. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent—e.g., “the sea beneath yawned in slow tides” and the bell’s silence as a “miscount in the universe.” There are no visible loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks that blunt immediacy, and syntax is clean. The density of metaphor edges toward lush in places, but it remains legible and never muddies causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and few, if any, wasted sentences; images often do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors are vivid yet mostly coherent and not overstacked, and rhythm varies well across sentences and paragraphs. The piece avoids repetition and scaffolding, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle. A few metaphors (“twilight bled,” “thin bruise”) brush the edge of the familiar, but they’re executed with enough specificity to feel earned rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, mood, and character. Images like the crystal opening “like a flower that remembered being water” are fresh and precise rather than merely ornate. However, figurative language is present in a high proportion of sentences, which edges toward overrich in a few spots and could tire a reader in a longer piece. Even so, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no notable loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and figurative language that rarely overreaches or repeats conceptually. Nearly every line advances character, world, or stakes; there is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping. The closure image is clean and undulled by ornament—it sharpens rather than blurs the emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and avoid muddle, even under pressure beats. There’s minimal redundancy and no noticeable syntactic templates or scaffolding that slow momentum. A few high-flown phrases risk edging toward purple but do not obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently polished, with strong rhythmic variety and high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“dormant constellations,” “puzzle’s last lock,” “corpse flower… collapsing into steam and memory”) are vivid yet controlled; they support clarity rather than obscuring it. There’s some lushness, but no obvious synonym loops, template cadences, or figurative muddle, and the final image lands sharply. Line-level craft is at or near publishable quality for a high-end venue.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action, embodying emotion, and maintaining atmosphere. Figurative language is frequent yet controlled; images like laughter as “phantom” blooming in sound pockets and silence settling “like limescale” feel precise rather than florid. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic monotony, and the final lines land cleanly without metaphor muddle. The only slight constraint on a higher score is that the figurative density is near the upper limit where, in a few spots, image layering risks drawing attention to craft over moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without slack, and the metaphors are mostly precise and non-redundant. The rhythm between long, dense lines and taut, declarative ones (“Home, she said…”) gives real propulsion in a reflective piece. Figurative density is high but pattern-consistent, and I didn’t spot significant loops, scaffolding, or muddled images. A few images approach saturation—e.g., several “light” and “fog” metaphors clustered—but they remain legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences pull double duty for mood and information without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent yet largely controlled and thematically tuned (fire, ash, metal, broken tools), and the rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Syntax is clear, with no action-sequence confusion, and the final third lands with a clean, resonant cadence. The only restraint on a higher score is that the figurative saturation occasionally edges toward purple, which might benefit from one or two trims at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but disciplined; metaphors are fresh and coherent (“shard of hush” pressing wrinkles into air, rust as exhausted confetti) and rarely feel overwrought. Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—without obvious redundancy or scaffold. There are no noticeable loops, syntactic templates, or figurative muddles that impede clarity, even in high-pressure beats. The only minor limitation is density: a few lines verge on saturation, but they don’t materially blunt momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but controlled: images like “static like a nest of metal bees” and “the ferry had shifted tracks onto a neighboring thought” are fresh and comprehensible. Sentences typically do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without feeling padded, and there are no obvious paraphrase loops or template cadences. Figurative language clusters toward the lyrical, but the story largely avoids mixed metaphors or purple overgrowth that would obscure action. The final images in the grotto are particularly clean despite their conceptual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense with metaphor but largely avoids muddle; images like “embers pressed under glass” and “white lines gently shifting as memories alter the shapes of promises” are both clear and thematically apt. Sentences do multiple jobs at once—advancing setting, emotion, and concept—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and the syntax modulates with the scene’s emotional turns. Line-level control supports, rather than obscures, the closure beat with the thread and doorway.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language—“symbols unfolding like tidal flowers,” “frozen sound,” “traced the outline of a missing continent”—is rich but controlled, with no mixed metaphors or opaque constructions that impede understanding. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each line feels necessary to the cumulative pressure and imagery. The final sentences in particular land with clarity and cadence, cleanly recharging earlier motifs without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, mood) with minimal redundancy, and the rhythm varies well. Figurative language is consistent and thematically aligned with sound, breath, and silence; there are no mixed metaphors or muddled images. The prose occasionally clusters metaphors (“reeling hush,” “underwater lanterns”) in a way that borders on lush, but it never obscures clarity or stalls momentum. There’s little to no scaffold or synonym looping, especially around the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet controlled, and many sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, and worldbuilding at once). Metaphors are generally fresh and coherent, and the repetition of “crashing hush” and breathing/pressure images creates a deliberate sonic and thematic pattern. There’s little to no scaffold or synonym-churn; sentences vary in length and structure enough to maintain momentum. One could argue the experiment explanation flirts with slight density, but it doesn’t tip into muddle or purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid yet controlled imagery, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and character-grounded (radio static, frozen snow as pixelation, voice stitching like ice over a pond), and they support rather than obscure causality. Sentence rhythm varies well, and nearly every line advances either emotional pressure or conceptual setup. The prose skirts the edge of lushness in places, but it remains clear, and no figurative excess dulls the climax or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with most lines doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and advancing the conceptual stakes simultaneously). Metaphors like “towers of bone…like pale lightning frozen in stone” and “powder that sparkled…like molted letters from an unwritten script” are vivid and coherent with the story’s logic. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and rhythm shifts enough to avoid monotony. The only reservation is occasional near-saturation of figurative language, which approaches but doesn’t quite cross into overrichness for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, figurative language is striking and usually coherent, and information density is high with little true scaffolding. A few metaphors verge on purple or stack somewhat (“bruise in reality,” “harmony untamed”) but they’re thematically aligned rather than gratuitous. There’s minimal redundancy and the syntax remains clear even in complex images. The final line is the weakest stylistically—slightly abstract compared to prior concrete images—but doesn’t significantly dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor is generally coherent, and nearly every line advances both atmosphere and event. The prose is dense but purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or repetition and clean syntax throughout. A few images verge on richness-for-its-own-sake, but they don’t materially obscure causality or the closure image. The final paragraphs in particular balance lyricism and clarity well, preserving momentum through the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, images are vivid yet generally clear, and almost every line carries multiple functions (world, emotion, theme). There is a high metaphor density, but it is mostly coherent and purposeful; “brittle hush,” “software that weighed every parcel like a confession,” and “twilight thickened like ink washing from a wound” reinforce tone and stakes. A couple of spots verge on minor purple or explanatory (“because his own reason for walking…was simple”), but they don’t significantly stall momentum or obscure cause/effect. No obvious loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony appear.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that generally pull double duty (worldbuilding + emotion). Sentences are musical without being opaque, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. There is a near-constant figurative charge—dust, silence, light—all described in metaphor-rich language that occasionally skirts purple but rarely confuses. A bit more modulation (letting a few plain lines through in peak beats) would keep the lyricism from feeling slightly over-saturated for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, economical, and evocative; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent (“air grew cool and grainy, like the texture of old film” is a standout). There’s no evident scaffold, synonym churn, or confusing metaphor stack, and the closure image is clear and undulled by overwriting. A bit more variation in sentence architecture at the very end might sharpen the cadence further, but this is already publishable-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied and musical, and images often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., mist erasing her arrival, rocks shifting like “breathing gills”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors feel internally consistent and seldom overstack. There’s little evident scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line adds new texture or pressure. A tiny fraction of phrases flirt with decorative lyricism, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions—advancing scene, mood, and character—while maintaining clarity. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt; images like the hair as “a vein torn from the dark” and minutes that “hoped to slip their own locks” reinforce motif rather than drift into purple. Momentum holds despite the lyricism, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. A few spots verge on density saturation, but they don’t blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, worldbuilding) without obvious redundancy, and metaphor usage is vivid yet mostly disciplined (“glass ribs jutting from the water like a drowned cathedral” is exemplary). There is occasional density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and doesn’t blur causality or action. No major loops, scaffolding, or template cadences drag momentum. A tiny bit of pruning in the highest-density descriptive blocks could make the pressure spike even cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and musical, with a high rate of figurative language that mostly lands and carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character. Line-level clarity is strong; despite the lyricism, cause and effect remain easy to follow, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. A few metaphors (“defiance like a second spine,” “index of obsolete storms”) flirt with decorative excess but do not materially drag momentum or obscure meaning. The overall rhythm and information density are publish-ready, if just shy of the most austere top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and musical, with strong verbs, concrete images, and clean syntax; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, the density of figurative language is very high—nearly every line carries a metaphor or elevated phrase—which occasionally risks purple-prose saturation even though clarity remains intact. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or grammatical slips, and momentum is maintained despite the lushness. A bit more modulation between plain and ornate would push this towards truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, varied rhythms, and metaphors that mostly land cleanly and reinforce one another (nets, knots, exhumation, accumulation of silence). The prose occasionally risks purple, and phrases like “across sharing a secret” and the repeated “accumulates silence” motif scrape the edge of self-consciousness. Even so, momentum is maintained, and each line tends to advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, frequently doing double duty for character, setting, and theme. Figurative language—maps as memories, the chapel as listener—is coherent and extended rather than scattered, avoiding mixed-metaphor clutter. There’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffold; nearly every line advances atmosphere or meaning. The only limitation is that the prose maintains a fairly uniform, meditative tempo, with minimal rhythmic acceleration at moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, mood) with minimal scaffolding, and syntax varies to maintain momentum. Metaphors are generally sharp and coherent, and there’s no evident looping or synonym churn. The density of figurative language is high but controlled; a few images approach the ornate, yet they don’t obscure sense or causality. Final lines are clean and weighted, with no mechanical moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally avoid redundancy while sustaining a musical rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and coherent with the aesthetic; metaphors extend the worldbuilding instead of colliding. There is some risk of overload (e.g., “mist hummed,” “tinkersong,” “ghost in code” stacked close) but clarity holds and the closure image lands cleanly. No significant scaffold, loops, or syntactic monotony impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, packed with information, and often do two or three jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, and character). Figurative language is vivid yet controlled, with only occasional repetition of key abstractions rather than true purple prose. There are no significant loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic artifacts that slow momentum or muddy causality. The only minor drag is a slight overreliance on the same thematic terms, which flirts with redundancy but doesn’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, characterization) with little true padding, and the figurative language is coherent and fresh (e.g., “as if the universe needed sweeping,” “spool” as recurring metaphor). Paragraphing and rhythm create a pleasing ebb without stalling momentum, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding redundancies. A few images flirt with density, but they cohere into a pattern rather than competing. The final line neatly recombines central motifs without feeling overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies to support a quiet but tense mood. Figurative language is mostly clean and grounded in the character’s way of seeing; repeated phrases like “centuries-old coin” are noticeable but not egregious. There’s little to no synonym churn or paraphrase looping; each sentence tends to add new pressure or texture. A few lines lean toward abstract summary (“Her motivation had always been simple and impossible”), but they’re brief and supported by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but highly controlled: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, theme) without redundancy, and metaphors are coherent and on-theme with mapping and light. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, flowing descriptive lines and shorter, declarative ones as tension builds. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the line “sociable isolation” is a good example of compression that replaces several explanatory sentences. A few images lean toward lush (e.g., “old librarian wandering shifting shelves”), but they remain precise rather than purple and do not impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with images that mostly cohere physically and conceptually (e.g., “silence…layered, like dust…made of other people’s unfinished sentences”). The prose sustains momentum despite density, and the closure image (“somewhere above the clouds, the frozen library listened, and slowly, it thawed”) lands cleanly without figurative muddle. At times the metaphor load skirts the edge of purple, but it never significantly obscures clarity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, with dense but generally precise imagery that rarely feels excessive. Phrases like “floating rock arches that drifted like reefs” and “empty ladders into the violet updraft like discarded vertebrae” are vivid and functional, deepening both mood and world. There’s minimal redundancy, no obvious scaffolding, and the prose maintains momentum even while being poetic. A few beats could arguably bear one fewer metaphor for even cleaner impact at peak pressure, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level work is dense yet disciplined: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept, often two at once, and there is little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is coherent and thematically aligned (time as a trapped bird, ash “folded into the sky”), avoiding mixed metaphors even under pressure. Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter, calmer closures after more baroque build-ups, giving the piece a strong read-aloud cadence. The prose is rich enough that a few readers might find it nearly too ornate, but clarity and momentum never meaningfully suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is tight: nearly every sentence carries multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without bloat, and figurative language is fresh yet clear (“bruised silver fruit,” “bleeding hope,” “graceless beauty scraped along the cliff”). Rhythm varies well across clauses and paragraphs, avoiding monotony or scaffolded repetition. There are no obvious loops, mixed metaphors, or clotted intensifier strings even in high-pressure beats. It stops just short of the rarefied 9+ band because the language, while excellent, doesn’t yet produce that unmistakable sense of formal inevitability at the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, with high information density and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops; images typically do double duty for character and theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (braiding, knots, choruses, architecture), avoiding mixed metaphors even as it recurs. The stress-test passage is slightly more abstracted than the rest, but not enough to blur sense or momentum. There are no noticeable syntactic tics or generation artifacts, and the final image is crisp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and metaphor-rich, yet it generally avoids muddle: images like “glass leaves flashing reflections of skies that had never existed” are both clear and thematically apt. Sentences multitask—establishing world, mood, and interiority at once—without obvious scaffold, repetition, or synonym churn. Rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical, and there are no line-level artifacts that obscure causality or dull the final image. The lushness edges close to over-saturation in places, but it remains controlled and legible, which only slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, and character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is inventive yet legible, and there are no mixed metaphors that cloud meaning. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, especially in the descent and tasting beats, where syntax tightens to match the stakes. If anything, the density of imagery in the opening paragraphs approaches the upper limit before risk of overload, but it remains just on the right side of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and musical without collapsing into muddle; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus action). The figurative language is coherent and thematically unified around bodies, mechanisms, and grain; there are no obvious mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and the closing cadence is well-judged. The density of imagery flirts with overrichness in a few spots, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but generally precise: images like “notes crumbling like chalk under water” and “fossils returning to a skeleton” carry multiple layers of work without muddle. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and almost every line advances either atmosphere, character, or the conceptual frame, keeping momentum despite lyric density. There is some risk of over-saturation—metaphor appears in most sentences—but the figurative palette is coherent (geology, biology, light, helices) rather than scattershot. That slight tendency toward purple, especially in cumulative abstractions, is the main reason this sits at strong rather than truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative density is high, yet metaphors are coherent and motif-linked (thresholds, inversion, seeds, blaze) rather than haphazard; no major purple-prose muddle appears. Syntax varies nicely, and the final cadence (“books obediently heavy again… its work complete”) lands cleanly. The only restraint from an even higher score is that a few stacked images verge on ornamental, adding texture more than additional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character) without bloat, and figurative language is vivid but not overwrought. There are no noticeable loops, template cadences, or metaphor tangles, and the rhythm on the page supports the story’s “intensely quiet” tone while still moving forward. The climactic grove-motion paragraph is especially well-balanced, dense yet legible. A hair more variation in sentence structure at a few points could sharpen propulsion, but this is already publishable-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, avoid loops, and carry multiple functions (world, emotion, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images of magnetism, boards, promises, and silence interlock rather than clash. There are no notable artifacts, redundancies, or copy errors, and the final line lands cleanly as an image that carries conceptual weight. If anything, the uniformly rich lyricism could benefit from a sharper, sparser spike at the very highest-pressure moment, but this is a refinement, not a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt (“descending a spiral staircase inside his own chest,” “an audience waiting behind velvet curtains”) and rarely feels ornamental. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite reflection. The high metaphor density flirts with purple in places, which nudges this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is tight and musical, with high information density—most sentences serve character, atmosphere, and theme at once. Figurative language is abundant yet largely coherent and controlled; motifs of cords, mist, rot, and breath recur purposefully rather than as purple clutter. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences, and rhythm modulates well between long lyric lines and shorter, weight-bearing statements. The only caution is that the sustained metaphorical richness in nearly every sentence may slightly risk saturation in some markets.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character perspective—without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is rich yet coherent; metaphors (“stone remembering forests,” water carrying impressions) cluster around a consistent semantic field of memory, motion, and growth. Syntax varies well, and rhythm modulates appropriately between calm description and charged discovery inside the hollow. A few lines flirt with over-lushness, but clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and typically multi-functional (world, character, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent; images like “ink lines converging in slow motion” and “metal cliffs” deepen both mood and concept without muddling clarity. There’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere or insight. The density edges toward lush, but momentum holds and the closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined; figurative language usually advances both setting and emotion (“lightning without sound,” “living throat of light”). Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and interior state—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Density is high yet readable, and the closure image is clear despite the lyricism. At times imagery stacks toward the ornate, but it does not materially obscure action or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, interiority, theme) with few redundancies, and rhythm varies in step with the scene’s contemplative pressure. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and tends not to stack in ways that blur sense; most metaphors are fresh and apt. There are minor spots where density verges on over-ornate, but they do not materially drag momentum or obscure the closure image. Copy is clean and sequencing is crystal clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are mostly precise, and nearly every line advances either atmosphere, concept, or character. Figurative language is rich but usually apt; metaphors like “a pond refusing to admit it was ice” are both fresh and clarifying. There is some density/overwriting risk where metaphor follows metaphor (e.g., grief as hum, then as equation, then as geometry) that could be marginally trimmed for even sharper impact. No major loops or syntactic artifacts blunt the closing image, but slight pruning could heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are vivid and usually do more than one job, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with time and perception (slow glass, stretched moments, roots tasting new soil) rather than ornamental. The prose sustains a high density of figurative language without muddling clarity or blunting momentum, which is difficult in a lyric, interior piece. Final images (the pendant as “tiny, trembling lantern,” buns, frayed ribbons) land cleanly and recharge prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, musical, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and coherent, with only occasional risk of edging toward purple without actually tipping into muddle. Momentum holds despite the lyricism; there’s very little scaffold or redundancy. It’s strong enough for publication as-is, though further trimming of a couple of metaphoric flourishes around the middle could sharpen pressure even more.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (world, mood, character) with minimal redundancy, and metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned. Phrasing like “raveling silence” and “a loom turned sideways” feels fresh yet lucid rather than purple. There are no meaningful artifacts, template cadences, or clarity lapses, and the final sentences land with precision and economy. The main constraint on an even higher score is that density of lyricism remains steady rather than dynamically sharpening at the moment of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but rarely tips into purple; metaphors are coherent and anchored in physical or craft imagery. There are no noticeable repetition loops or scaffolding sentences, and action-order remains clear even in the more abstracted mine passages. Line-level tension could be heightened slightly in the climax by shifting a bit more from description to tactile, breath-limited immediacy, but current control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character) and there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and thematically aligned; metaphors of weaving, rehearsal, and machinery are coherent with the setting and stakes. The prose maintains momentum despite its density, with paragraphing that marks conceptual turns and keeps the scene moving. A few abstractions (“flows of experience themselves,” “probability”) could be grounded a hair more, but they do not materially blur the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is precise and economical; most lines carry multiple functions (setting, mood, and character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded in the sea/lighthouse domain, avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. Rhythm varies naturally across the piece, and there’s no obvious scaffold, repetition loop, or filter-verb stack dulling immediacy. A few phrases nudge toward the lush (“luminescent ache”), but they are sparse and supported by context rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, generally doing double duty for atmosphere and character, with minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; images of light, memory, and weather interlock rather than clash, and the prose remains clear even at its most ornate. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece, with no obvious padding or expository thickets; key beats are dramatized in-scene. The density approaches purple in spots, but it never quite tips into muddle or self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) and the figurative language is largely fresh and coherent (“the wing flared… with all the colors refusing to separate”). Rhythm is varied, and there is little in the way of scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere or insight. The density of metaphors is very high, occasionally flirting with excess, but clarity is maintained and the final image lands cleanly. A slightly more varied texture—one or two plainer lines under pressure—could sharpen contrasts further.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and syntax, imagery is fresh and mostly economical, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic weight. Metaphors (“the storm sat low and sulking,” “moonlight pooled like spilt milk”) are vivid without becoming overwrought, and there’s no evident paraphrase looping or filler scaffolding. The density of figurative language is high but pattern-consistent and legible, never obscuring cause-and-effect or dulling the closure image. A touch more spareness around the central turn could heighten impact further, but as-is the prose is publish-ready for many elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and few if any redundant or scaffolding sentences. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme (lungs, weaving, swaddling, fractures), and it supports rather than obscures sense. A demanding editor might trim a metaphor or two to avoid saturation, but momentum and clarity hold, including at the climax. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm alive, and there are no noticeable grammatical or usage slips.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and there’s little visible scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“small planet of nestled paradoxes,” “question marks around an invisible center”) is generally fresh and coherent with the concept. The density of metaphor is high but controlled enough not to blur clarity or stall momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with good propulsion toward the central emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose line is remarkably strong: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs (image, mood, theme) with minimal scaffold, and the figurative language—“absence hardens into decor,” “steam, braided into the cold air”—is consistently coherent and grounded. Rhythm varies well, with short, declarative lines used for emphasis against longer, image-rich ones, and there’s no noticeable synonym churn or paraphrase loops. The density of metaphor is high but pattern-consistent and never so overwrought as to obscure sense or the closure image. A tiny trim in one or two description-heavy stretches could further sharpen momentum, but as-is it’s publish-ready at a demanding venue.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence pulls multiple weights (world-building, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and the figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent. Imagery like “numbers blossomed… like breath on a winter pane” and the founders’ faces as “smears of pale fire” maintains clarity while enriching atmosphere. The prose skirts but does not cross into purple; density is high yet readable, with logical sequencing and clean grammar. A touch more variation in sentence structure at the height of the dilemma could sharpen momentum, but current control is easily publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are fresh, metaphors coherent, and most sentences do double duty advancing mood and character. Phrasing such as “teeth that remembered every bite” or “pain came clean, like river water through a fresh cut” is vivid without tipping into muddle. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; the prose flows with good rhythm and variation. The density of figurative language is high but generally controlled, and trimming one or two less-necessary flourishes in the midsection could sharpen momentum even further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush but largely precise, with high information density—most sentences advance world, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“terrestrially cosmic,” “children teaching clouds to spell their names”), and the sensory layering around taste never feels redundant. There are very few scaffold or paraphrase loops; the lyricism almost always does new work rather than spinning its wheels. A handful of lines border on explanatory (“archives are heavy”) rather than freshly dramatized, which modestly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and plot) with clean clarity and momentum. There is some density of figurative language—“auroral” repeats, and a few metaphors (“frozen fireworks,” “indelible badge”) flirt with purple—but they rarely obscure sense or pacing. Backstory is woven efficiently into present beats instead of stalling them. Trimming a handful of ornamental phrases would make this immediately publishable at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: images are vivid, metaphors mostly fresh, and sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythm is varied and read-aloud clean, and there are no major loops or template cadences dragging momentum. Density skews lush but remains legible; only a few phrases flirt with over-decoration without tipping into purple. The final paragraphs in particular balance clarity and lyricism in a way befitting elite-market work.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and dense with meaning, and most images pull double duty for mood and world-building. Metaphors (“his throat closing like a frostbitten gate,” “rearranged the furniture of the heart”) are apt and rarely feel strained. There is some saturation of figurative language, but it coheres into a taught pattern rather than purple excess, and clarity is never compromised. Little to no scaffolding or repetition appears; nearly every line carries specific weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and images that generally do more than one job (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) at once. Metaphor use is frequent but largely coherent and non-redundant (“static…like sand in circuits,” “error messages scrolling like prayer flags,” “nightmares into data-embers”), and the rhythm avoids mechanical repetition. A few phrases verge on lushness, but they don’t obscure causality or flatten momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with a satisfying opening and a well-weighted final line.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but rarely overwrought, with images that do more than one job (“Bougainvillea spilled like open veins” both sets color and hints at threatened lifeblood). Sentences vary in length and cadence, creating a smooth momentum from description into action and back into reflection without obvious loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (mail, veins, breath, dust, listening); it enhances rather than obscures the climax, where the syntax appropriately simplifies to underline the act of listening. I see no significant grammatical or clarity issues, and the final lines land with a precise, unpadded weight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, images are precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned (sound, dance, probability, breathing structures); there are no significant mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. Momentum holds despite the lyric density, but at times the prose edges toward saturation where a single plainer beat might sharpen impact. These are fine-tuning concerns rather than structural flaws, keeping the piece solidly publishable at a high tier.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, densely meaningful, and often do double duty for setting, theme, and character (“the town kept its distance, pretending not to smell the slow souring of its flesh”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, with recurring metaphors (gravity, tides, residue, light) rather than scattershot ornament. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances image or concept. The richness borders on saturation in places, but it does not seriously impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is impressive: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world, image, interiority) without obvious scaffolding, and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled; metaphors like “terrestrially cosmic” or “moonlight pressed into stone” are vivid and coherent with the story’s motifs. There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every line is lush—which slightly blunts momentum and could be trimmed in places for elite-venue economy. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence does double duty for atmosphere and character, and the prose reads smoothly aloud with varied syntax. Metaphors are frequent but coherent and thematically linked to paper, language, weather, and architecture, creating a unified texture rather than a random grab-bag. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the narrative moves forward with each paragraph, and the final image is clean and charged. The only restraint on going higher is the sheer density of figurative language, which risks feeling slightly uniform in cadence across the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: metaphors are vivid but coherent (“sunlight on a flooded room,” “heart hammering like a fist on a locked door”), and sentences often do double duty for mood and information. There’s high information density with minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; almost every line earns its place. The prose approaches purple in spots but maintains clarity and momentum, particularly around the shell vision and the closing training sequence. There are no noticeable syntactic artifacts, tense slips, or rhythm glitches that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally clean syntax; most sentences do more than one job (world, mood, and character at once). Metaphoric language is frequent but not incoherent, and key lines (“each ornate letter balanced between loyalty and rebellion like a blade on glass”) are sharp and apt. There is mild risk of overload—nearly every sentence is lush, with many modifiers—which slightly blurs momentum in places where a plainer beat might heighten impact. Still, there are no significant loops, artifacts, or muddled images to undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, information-dense, and almost always doing multiple jobs (world, character, and theme at once). Figurative language (“the desert night knotted itself into webs of intrigue,” “the canyon became a throat and she stood upon its tongue”) is vivid and largely controlled, with no major mixed metaphors or clarity losses. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; exposition is compressed efficiently into a few well-placed lines. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the prose occasionally edges toward lushness that could, in a stricter market, invite trimming without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is consistently strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, character) without padding. Metaphors like “borrowed starlight” and “truths…need living hearts as their rafts” are coherent, thematically apt, and not stacked to the point of muddle. There’s minimal redundancy and no noticeable scaffold or template cadences that sap momentum. A slight tendency to keep every line metaphorically charged in a quiet scene is the only minor restraint on a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple loads (image, emotion, theme) without feeling redundant, and rhythm varies gracefully between long, sinuous lines and shorter pivots. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and thematically cohesive around light, water, and subtle motion, so it reads as intentional lyricism rather than purple excess. Scaffold or synonym loops are minimal; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or interior stakes. A couple of high-register or repeated coinages slightly graze naturalness but do not significantly slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative (“radioactive dust swirling… in slow, luminous veils”) with strong syntactic variety and generally high information density. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur clarity, and momentum is maintained from set-up through the dig to the decision. There are very few, if any, scaffold or paraphrase loops; almost every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for setting, character, and theme (“because naming the chaos made it slightly less likely to eat his thoughts”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and pointed; images like “gravel poured over drums” and “mountainous animals smelling a new trainer” are vivid and legible. There is mild risk of metaphor saturation, yet it rarely muddies clarity or momentum, and scaffolding or repetition is minimal. A touch more sparseness or sharper contrast (a few plain declarative lines amid the lushness, especially at the climax) could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for mood and character, and the figurative language (“wind poured,” “glass trembling as if catching a chill it could not name”) is generally precise and evocative. There’s some density of metaphor and adjective strings that edges toward purple, but they rarely blur sense or stall momentum. Repetition and cadence feel patterned rather than accidental, and there are no obvious scaffolding loops or clarity problems. A slight trimming of ornament in a few spots could sharpen impact without altering structure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is high: imagery is fresh (“core sample of night,” “bruised light”), syntax varied, and almost every line earns its place by advancing mood, world, or character. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors that break the spell. Momentum is well-managed for a lyric piece; there’s little scaffolding or repetition, and exposition about the monks and the artifact is efficiently woven into action. A very slight tendency toward piling metaphors in some lines keeps this just shy of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: images are fresh, metaphors largely consistent, and sentences vary rhythmically without feeling overdesigned. Many lines multitask, advancing world, mood, and theme simultaneously (“Wind scraped at the stone walls with a restrained wildness, as if rehearsing the storms it was not yet allowed to be”). There’s density of figurative language, but it’s controlled and pattern-consistent rather than purple, and I don’t see significant loops or scaffolding. A few abstract summarizing sentences could be tightened, yet they don’t materially dull momentum or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is fluent, image-rich, and mostly efficient; metaphors like the tunnel as a “throat clearing itself” and “air itself seemed bruised” are vivid without becoming muddled. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and paragraphs generally move the scene or pressure forward rather than looping. A few lines restate an idea (“entangled memories tightening like wires” vs. later “entangled memories were not just hauntings”) with similar language, but not enough to drag momentum. Figurative density is high yet controlled, and syntax remains clear even at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-by-line craft is excellent: nearly every sentence carries multiple functions (setting, mood, character, or theme) without redundancy, and the metaphors (“a vibrant hush,” “like a confession snagging on a word”) are fresh and coherent. The rhythm varies gracefully between long, lush lines and tighter clauses at points of realization, sustaining momentum despite the quiet action. There’s no noticeable synonym-churn, template cadence, or figurative muddle, including at the closing beat. The lyrical density is high but always lucid, justifying a 9-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly crafted, with strong rhythmic control and multi-function sentences that build world, character, and mood simultaneously. Metaphoric language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful (“maps seen from the perspective of a falling compass”), and repetition of motifs (bells, blind spots, yearning) feels patterned rather than looped. There’s mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every line sparkles—which can slightly blunt impact in high-pressure moments. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no obvious scaffolding, redundancy, or grammar issues.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, emotion) with little redundancy; rhythm varies, and images are mostly precise and non-generic. Metaphors extend coherently (music, choirs, silence, echoes) rather than stacking randomly, and corporate jargon is sparingly, aptly used. There’s mild density in a few consecutive metaphors, but it doesn’t blur clarity or momentum, keeping the prose in high-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished: images are sharp and original (e.g., “a slow grinding choir beneath his boots”), and most sentences perform multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and character insight—without bloat. Rhythm varies intelligently, with denser descriptive stretches balanced by tight dialogue and concise interior moves. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and rarely mixed, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences. The only limit on a higher score is that intensity sometimes leans on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete bodily stakes, slightly softening impact under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished, with varied syntax and a strong ear for rhythm; most sentences do double duty for character, mood, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, and the comparisons are coherent and sensorial rather than mixed or showy (e.g., “truck had veered, why the world had shattered without warning” tying emotional to physical shattering). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; information density stays high without becoming opaque. The final lines land cleanly, reusing prior diction (“fold in patience”) in a way that feels like culmination rather than echo.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often striking—metaphors like “silence settles over the valley like slow dust” and “as if loneliness were another crop needing care” are vivid and coherent with the story’s logic. Most sentences carry multiple functions (character, setting, theme) without obvious redundancy, and there’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative density is high but generally controlled; a few images verge on lushness, yet they stay internally consistent and do not obscure action or causality. Line-level rhythm supports the quiet, accumulating pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and rarely redundant, and metaphors tend to be precise and thematically aligned (thoughts as wires, dunes as restless denial). The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, and key beats—like the line walker almost falling—land crisply. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it enhances rather than obscures causality or image. Any risk of purple prose is kept in check by consistent internal logic and by tying images back to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, and images usually do multiple jobs at once (characterize, set tone, advance situation). Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; metaphors are consistent with the world and sensibility, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops. Pacing remains smooth despite lyric density, with almost every line either advancing the archive encounter or sharpening atmosphere. A few lines verge on over-ornate, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied sentence structures, and high information density—most sentences carry world, character, and theme at once. Metaphors like “burning the joints from the skeleton of meaning” are striking and apt. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which edges toward saturation and slightly blunts momentum and contrast. There are no serious clarity or scaffold issues, but a ruthless editor would likely trim a few images to let the strongest ones breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high: nearly every sentence carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, theme—without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent and voice-justified, with very few strained images; key metaphors (fog sculptures, bottle-wind, unmade bed) are both vivid and thematically functional. Momentum never feels stalled by description; instead, description *is* the narrative engine in this lyric mode. I see no significant loops or artifacts that blur closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and most carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and action). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; images (“mirrors trembling like teeth,” “data surge hit…like weather”) are apt rather than showy, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping or scaffolding. A few phrases (e.g., “changelessly constant”) flirt with redundancy, but they feel intentional as motif rather than artifact. Momentum is well maintained even in reflective lines.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: dense images that nearly always pull double duty (“compact moon” for the shard, “her serenity a kind of weather”) and an absence of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned, never muddying sense. Momentum is maintained despite the quiet mode; every sentence either advances emotional pressure or deepens atmosphere. Opening and closing lines are both sharp and echo the central concerns, giving the piece a satisfying acoustic shape.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally apt and controlled, and momentum holds despite the density of imagery. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line bears a figurative weight—so a few plainer beats might give the high points more room to resonate. Still, there are no major artifacts or loops, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is dense and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty as image, characterization, and theme (“scars arranged like careful handwriting, a counterfeit body in a world that preferred smudges”). Figurative language is frequent but well-controlled; metaphors tend to share a semantic field (paperwork, maps, constellations) and do not collide. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity issues; the prose maintains momentum even in reflective moments. A few lines risk feeling slightly over-packed in close succession, but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient: most images do double duty in building world, mood, and theme, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphor density is high, but the figurative language remains coherent and tonally aligned; phrases like “pearl of stillness” and “zephyr bloom” risk purple but stay intelligible and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies and supports a flowing lyric cadence without obscuring action or causality. Minor tightening could pare a few near-synonymous flourishes, yet line-level craft is comfortably publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and information-dense: almost every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme, often more than one at once. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and coherent; images like “plastic conduit sagged like abandoned vines” and “rusty bolts rose like broken teeth” sharpen rather than blur. There are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or rhythmically templated runs, and the final lines land with clarity and cadence. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the pile-up of lush descriptors edges close to saturation in a few spots, though it never quite clogs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich and controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in image and concept, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned (pages, rivers, currents, margins), and the closing sentence cleanly gathers them. There is mild risk of overload—occasional phrases (“a single feral nexus in mist,” “unwritten possibilities”) flirt with purple, and figurative density is consistently high—but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant loops or mechanical artifacts appear, so any deductions are for slight excess rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and images that usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“paths furred with moss,” “book…like footsteps vanishing from old snow”). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and not so thick as to obscure sense; momentum keeps moving through each sentence. There are no noticeable loops or scaffold phrases, and the closing paragraphs land cleanly. At times the diction edges toward ornate, but it remains controlled and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: metaphors are fresh, generally coherent, and often perform multiple functions (e.g., “exhausted metronomes” encapsulates time, fatigue, and mechanism). There is some density of figurative language, but it’s patterned, legible, and doesn’t obscure action or closure; each sentence meaningfully advances atmosphere or concept. Redundancy is minimal, and the prose avoids template cadences or scaffolding. A touch more variation between the highly lyrical stretches and simpler lines could sharpen impact further, but as is, this is near-publishable on craft alone.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is excellent: almost every sentence does double duty (advancing action while deepening motif or mood), and the rhythms support the contemplative, ritual cadence of the scene. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and anchored (“teeth skipping like a stuttered sentence,” “spring coiled like a question,” “wounded season”), with minimal paraphrase loops. A few lines edge near over-articulation of the conceptual frame (“store wonder in the cellar of reason,” “wonder was shy”) where image and inference are already doing that work, but they don’t materially dull the closure. Overall, the prose reads polished and publication-ready with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with very little true scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, tone, theme). The only restraint on a higher score is that the metaphor density is nearly continuous, occasionally edging toward purple in less pressured moments and risking saturation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is highly controlled: sentences carry multiple layers (image, theme, and emotion) without collapsing into muddle. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and character-true—the recurring time/animal metaphors (“time could be coaxed like an animal”) deepen rather than blur meaning. There are no noticeable paraphrase loops or scaffold phrases; each line adds new pressure or texture. The final sentence crisply recharges earlier motifs (rain, skylight, usefulness, staying) with no syntactic or tonal stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and the rhythm varies effectively. Metaphoric language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed or clashing images. There are almost no redundant paraphrase loops or filler constructions, and the prose remains legible despite its lyricism. Only a faint sense of ornamentation in a few spots keeps it from absolute top-tier minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is tight: nearly every sentence does double duty for image and theme, and the metaphors are fresh yet controlled. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; the prose flows with good rhythm and clarity despite its density. Figurative language is frequent but not purple, and I don’t see mixed metaphors or syntactic artifacts that blur sense. It falls just short of the very top band only because the diction stays in a fairly stable mode without one or two truly breathtaking turns that reframe everything.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded (“ink soaking slowly into his ledger,” “water…tracing old fractures like erased names”). At times the density of modifiers and abstractions edges toward purple and could be trimmed without loss, especially around repeated formulations of hush and nostalgia. Nonetheless, clarity never slips, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple layers (setting, mood, character interior) without bloat, and rhythm varies effectively from long, sinuous reflections to short, sharp beats (“Got something”). Figurative language is dense but coherent and controlled; metaphors reinforce each other rather than clash, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. The prose propels rather than stalls, especially through the dive sequence where syntax tightens with pressure. At a prestigious-venue standard, a few abstractions could be pared for even more sting, but they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and metaphors that are mostly clean and mutually reinforcing. The prose balances atmosphere and motion well; nearly every sentence advances setting, concept, or Eli’s evolving understanding. While figurative language is frequent, it reads as intentional pattern rather than purple excess, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding repetitions. The final lines in particular are sharp and condensed, avoiding any explanatory sag.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is excellent: sentences are varied, precise, and multi-functional, often advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, with clear motifs (threads, maps, gardens, patterns) rather than scattered ornament. I see no significant paraphrase loops or syntactic tics; almost every line earns its place. The final sentences land cleanly and musically without veering into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and economical despite its lyric richness; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without redundancy. Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent, and rhythm varies in ways that support shifts from spectacle to intimate revelation. A few phrases (“piston blossoms,” “a sputtering garden of industry”) tread close to ornamental but don’t significantly slow momentum or blur clarity. There are no noticeable looped sentences, scaffolding remnants, or syntactic glitches.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, often do double duty for mood and information, and avoid scaffolding or obvious loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful (“memories like nails,” “each grain catching light like a held breath”) rather than decorative clutter. A few metaphors risk density in high-pressure moments, but they do not obscure cause and effect or dull the closure image. Grammar and sequencing are clean, so momentum through the critical beats remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is dense but not muddled; images like “constellations learning to walk” or the box “breathing with slow, internal light” are fresh and coherent. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding phrases, or template cadences, and rhythm shifts appropriately from expansive to sharp at key beats. The final lines land cleanly and echo earlier motifs without feeling over-engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined: figurative language is purposeful, rarely redundant, and often multi-functional, as in suns “budding” and “shedding layers like old regrets.” Sentences carry high information density, advancing both world and psyche without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. A few phrases (“troubling serenity,” “approximates infinity yet never quite arrives”) edge toward self-conscious lyricism, but they remain legible and thematically apt rather than muddy. Rhythm and structure support momentum in a reflective mode, and the final image cleanly recharges earlier motifs without figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and dense with meaning; most sentences do double or triple duty (world, mood, theme) without notable scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are controlled and coherent—“glass bones” of the roof, ribbon as river, stones as “unfinished doors”—all feed the core imagery set. Rhythm passes the read-aloud test, with varied openings and paragraphing that supports the piece’s accumulative cadence. The only restraint on a higher score is that figurative density is consistently high, which slightly risks over-richness in places without quite tipping into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, syntactically clean, and densely multi-functional, often advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously (“Time did not stop, exactly; it knelt…”). Metaphors—time kneeling, obsidian ridge as broken mirrors, the pendulum as a golden heart—are vivid and mostly coherent. The prose occasionally borders on over-saturated, with figurative language or conceptual phrasing in nearly every line, which risks slight exhaustion at this length. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no evident loops or scaffolding artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful imagery; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is a clear rhythmic sense in the progression of clauses and paragraphs, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The prose does flirt with over-saturation of metaphor, especially early (“ink through watered silk,” “sealed cobalt candle,” “old moonlight”), which may feel slightly purple at top-tier literary standards. Still, clarity and propulsion are largely intact, and the final beats land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, purposeful imagery, and high information density with minimal redundancy. Metaphors (e.g., the tower as “a frozen bolt of night,” the nib as “a living shard of river water”) are vivid and coherent, rarely straying into mixed or overwrought territory. The cadences support an accumulative, meditative pressure that suits a thinking story about modeling futures. A few sentences pack multiple metaphors and abstractions, creating a slight sense of lushness that could be trimmed for maximal sharpness in an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm varies pleasingly. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, building a unified texture around ash, embers, mist, and sound; it rarely tips into confusion. There are a few very dense lines (“hummed in a thistled calm, quiet yet full of tiny spines of interference”) that approach purple but remain decipherable and tonally apt. Because momentum is maintained and closure is clear, the slight excess in ornament keeps this just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are vivid and layered, and most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme). Figurative language (“murmurs congeal into a single held breath,” ash as snowfall) is evocative without becoming tangled or overmixed, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum despite the reflective mode, and the final line lands cleanly and memorably. A marginal pruning of slightly abstract phrases could make the prose even leaner, but there are no artifacts that mar clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, economical, and dense with meaning; images are generally fresh and apt (“beetle burrowing through history’s compost,” “towers leaning like broken teeth”). There is some metaphorical richness, but it avoids purple excess, and sentences tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies well across the piece, and the final sentence lands cleanly and memorably. I see no significant artifacts or clarity issues that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line by line, the prose is highly polished: images are fresh (“music lingered there like breath between pages”), and figurative language is dense but coherent and never muddled. Sentences carry multiple jobs—setting, theme, and character in one stroke—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies well, giving the narrative both hush and pulse, and there are no noticeable artifacts, loops, or clunky constructions, including in the closing beat. This is publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and musical, with metaphors (“rasped in the wind like an old lung,” “bright fish through dark water”) that are vivid yet coherent and rarely overstacked. Sentences do multiple jobs—world, emotion, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm varies well between longer, textured lines and shorter aphoristic beats, sustaining momentum despite a quiet plot. There is minor risk of over-ornamentation, but it doesn’t obscure sense or blur key beats, including the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical with varied syntax, and most metaphors (“drinking storm charge into its ribs,” “truth felt useful, almost medicinal”) pull double duty for mood and theme. The prose is lush but largely avoids purple excess; figurative density supports the lyric mode rather than obscuring meaning. Information is efficiently embedded in images rather than expository lumps, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences. A few phrases (“to preserve wonder in routine,” “careful sweetness of poured nectar dusk”) flirt with over-ornamentation, but they don’t blur causality or dilate the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong: images are vivid, metaphors coherent, and sentences do multiple jobs (characterization, setting, mood) with little waste. Phrases like “a view of gulls tracing lazy sigils above the water” and “the days blurred into a hushed blaze of observation” exemplify dense yet precise language. The prose leans heavily lyrical, but it avoids muddle or redundancy; the few near-repetitions (e.g., streetlight daydreaming) are purposeful callbacks, not scaffolding. It falls just shy of the absolute top band due to the consistently high figurative density, which occasionally risks overshadowing tension, but never quite does.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and images that often perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled; metaphors like “silt that billowed like breath from old lungs” and “her answer threaded through my thoughts like a careful needle” are apt and not contradictory. There is mild risk of over-richness, as nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, but momentum and clarity are preserved through the scene’s spine. No noticeable scaffolding, paraphrase loops, or syntactic monotony blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are dense yet mostly free of redundancy, and images are precise rather than generic. Figurative language is frequent but not purple; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with motion, effort, and structure. The prose sustains momentum despite its reflective bent because nearly every sentence either deepens the concept or advances Arin’s state. Minor repetition of ideas (endlessness, missed door) is purposeful, echoing the staircase’s recursive nature rather than feeling like scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and purposeful: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and meaning, with few if any scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Images are fresh and coherent (smog as a clogged lung, kindness as a lost language) and avoid mixed metaphors. The rhythm varies well between longer, lush sentences and tauter clauses, maintaining momentum despite the contemplative mode. There is a high figurative density, but it’s controlled and pattern-coherent, so it reads as stylistic strength rather than purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Images are fresh and coherent (“the posture of a ballerina and the vocabulary of a footnote,” “walking through the afterimage of a world that had already decided to vanish”). There is a lot of figurative texture, but it’s pattern-consistent and doesn’t blur sense or stall momentum. Very minor risk of lushness crowding breath, yet no real scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors to drag the line-level down.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, rich yet precise imagery, and high information density with little true scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors tend to be coherent and in-theme (bones/ribs of the island, molar in a jaw, trapped daylight as latent radiance), and they carry both atmosphere and meaning. The prose occasionally verges on uniformly ornate, but it does not tip into muddle or stall momentum. No significant loops, template cadences, or register slips undermine the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is highly controlled, varied in syntax, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs of atmosphere plus character or plot. Figurative language is vivid and often memorable (“every word a damp fingertip on his thoughts,” “hung in the air like badly developed photographs”), and clarity of action and causality remains intact even in the densest passages. However, the metaphor load is heavy—nearly every line in some stretches carries an image—which edges toward purple and could benefit from a few plainer beats for contrast. There are no visible loops, scaffolds, or technical slips dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional charge, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied and musical. Figurative language is dense but thematically unified around sound, sea, and pattern, avoiding mixed or incoherent metaphors. There are no significant scaffold loops or redundancy; progression is smooth and momentum rarely stalls. The only constraint keeping this below the very top band is that the density of imagery occasionally skirts richness for its own sake, though it does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level is tight and musical, with strong information density—many sentences do triple duty for setting, mood, and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and concrete (“maps curled like fossilized waves,” “iron eaten to scabbed lace”) without collapsing into purple excess or mixed metaphors. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics, and transitions are smooth. A few metaphors (“grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell”) edge toward lush, but they remain legible and thematically apt rather than muddying pressure or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is finely wrought: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that mostly land cleanly and in thematic harmony (ivy as annotation, leaves like “two pages reluctantly parting,” empty tracks swallowing echoes). Sentences vary in length and structure, creating a pleasing rhythm that supports both atmosphere and argument without feeling mechanical. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess, and there are no noticeable loops or synonym churn. The final line is particularly strong, recharging earlier train/track imagery without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, theme) without padding, and metaphor is largely clean and apt (“oceanic smoothness that wants to level everything”). The prose sustains a high lyrical density without collapsing into muddle, and there is little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few constructions verge on repetition in imagery (absence, disappearance, broken patterns), but they remain controlled rather than redundant. The final image is clear and potent, not obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and minimal redundancy; metaphors are generally clean and apt (“pages stuck together like reluctant lips,” “blackout fell like velvet over rust”). The rhythm supports the contemplative pressure without bogging down; almost every line advances setting, theme, or character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and there are no notable scaffold sentences or loops. Slight flirtations with purple prose in a few phrases are the only thing keeping this just below elite-range.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level work is dense but controlled: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world-building, or emotional stakes without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent, often doing double duty (e.g., the basilica humming “like a throat clearing before confession” both personifies setting and primes the emotional turn). Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through the story’s most charged sequences (the gem wheel, the transformation) without bogging in purple prose. I see no significant loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity stumbles, especially around the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with little redundancy, and there’s a clear ear for cadence. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and apt (“a triangle of absence,” “fingerprints left on fogged glass”), creating a cohesive texture rather than purple sprawl. I see minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; nearly every line earns its space. The sheer density of metaphor flirts with overload in a few spots, but never quite tips into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double-duty for atmosphere and character, and there are no real scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors are generally apt and vivid (“luminous punch card,” “encrypted rain”), and action order remains clear despite the lyric density. That said, figurative language is quite concentrated—phrases like “brilliant dimness” and “pinpricks in a shroud” edge toward purple when stacked, which in an elite venue might invite tightening. Even so, momentum holds and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally do multiple jobs (image, emotion, and information at once), and there is little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and internally coherent; recurring images (iron-tasting name, tooth-pulled time, sieved hush) read as motif, not purple excess. Momentum holds despite reflection, because each reflective beat either sharpens motive or primes the next physical move. A few metaphors (“pulse with no beat,” “bone finally admitting its break”) are familiar enough to slightly dull the edge of otherwise striking diction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, carry multiple functions at once, and maintain clarity despite a high metaphor density. Figurative language is mostly coherent and pointed (“field of brows plowed by sleeplessness,” “this stone listens but does not repeat”) and does not tangle or contradict itself. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The sheer frequency of images edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t meaningfully blur action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most metaphors doing multiple jobs—setting mood, revealing character, and reinforcing theme. There’s minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence adds a new slant or detail, and the closing image with the compass as “a metronome” is clean and resonant. At times the figurative load edges toward purple (e.g., “wet wool,” “backlash of regrets”), and a lighter touch in one or two spots could sharpen impact. Still, momentum is maintained, syntax is varied, and there are no clarity-compromising artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, most carry multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once), and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and coherent, giving the piece a distinctive texture. A few lines veer toward purple or over-packed abstraction, especially around the cleanse clinics’ civic role, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Overall, the prose is publishable as-is with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is crafted with strong rhythm, varied syntax, and high information density; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere and/or emotional stakes. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and non-redundant, and metaphors tend to reinforce a coherent cosmology (wind-currents, sap, galaxies, embers). There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences; cause/effect remains clear even in highly lyrical passages. The only notable weakness is a slight risk of over-saturation in imagery, which could be mitigated with a few strategic cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, image-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or synonym loops; nearly every sentence does character, setting, and thematic work. The figurative language is frequent but not incoherent, with recurring vehicles (ink, stone, clouds, cracks) building a unified texture instead of purple sprawl. Syntax varies well, and the final lines land with clean, uncluttered clarity. The only restraint on a higher score is that the density of metaphor slightly risks saturation in a few mid-paragraph stretches without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, varied syntax, and metaphors that tend to be both vivid and thematically apt (“denial had become architecture,” “scar tissue around the timeline”). There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or emotional stakes. The prose edges toward lush but avoids purple excess, and the final sentence cleanly recharges earlier motifs (weight, the Tear, probability as fabric/door) without muddling. A touch more spareness in a couple of conceptual explanations might heighten impact, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are clean and mutually supportive, building a coherent mythic texture rather than purple overload. There are no visible scaffolds, synonym loops, or template cadences; nearly every line earns its place by advancing character, world, or mood. Figurative density is high but controlled, and syntax remains clear even in the climactic run. One could trim a metaphor or two without harm, yet the current richness does not materially blur causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied structures, few wasted words, and high information density where most lines carry worldbuilding, tone, and character simultaneously. Figurative language (“smoky bruise,” “locks forgot which side was inside”) is vivid and generally precise, with little in the way of mixed metaphors or clotted description. There is some risk of purple prose given how many sentences carry an image or abstraction, but momentum largely holds and key beats remain clear. I see no significant scaffolding, repetition, or artifact loops that undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and very little scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, building a unified metaphoric field around motion, math, and celestial mechanics. Crucial beats—uncorking the vial, dust aligning, friction’s return—are rendered with clarity despite the lyric mode. The one restraint is that the density of metaphor verges on maximalist; an editor at the top tier might trim one or two slightly redundant images to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and a good ear for metaphor that stays coherent (“a darkroom timer…guarding a tiny, ticking eclipse”). There is some risk of saturation, as figurative language appears in many lines, but it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and momentum is maintained. Syntax varies, and paragraphing supports the scene’s gradual tightening toward the telescope rather than looping. Minor trims could make a few metaphors land harder by giving them more air, but line-level craft is already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme simultaneously). The figurative language—arguments as rays, questions as destinations, light as compass needles—is coherent and thematically aligned rather than decorative. There is some risk of over-saturation in metaphor and elevated phrasing, but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or momentum at this length. Trimming a few slightly redundant flourishes could sharpen impact, yet the current draft is already well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly crafted, with most lines doing double duty in image and theme, and very little scaffolding or redundancy; even repeated phrases (“rusted library under stars,” moon clearing the skyline) function as deliberate framing rather than loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess; “a luminous fracture walking” and “anarchy…before it hardened into silence” are precise rather than vague. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative sentences and tight, concrete action during the patrol sequence, maintaining momentum. Any minor repetition reads more like motif than artifact, so line-level debt is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally purposeful, with few redundancies. The figurative language is often striking (“garden of roots dangling into endless sky,” “horizon invited night with a purple rim”), and motifs recur with intent. However, metaphor density is high almost throughout, occasionally flirting with purple and risking desensitizing the impact of the strongest images. Trimming a handful of ornamental flourishes would likely improve momentum and leave the core images even more potent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) without padding, and rhythm varies effectively between longer lyrical lines and tighter beats. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically linked (storms, tides, memory as growth), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy; phrases like “luminous doubt” are repeated with purpose, not out of habit. The prose remains clear under peak pressure in the dream sequence, sustaining momentum while expanding the conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, varied, and carry multiple layers of work (image, mood, world-building) without bloating. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and usually apt, with minimal redundancy and no significant mixed metaphors; images like “smoke that never finds a chimney” sharpen rather than blur sense. Momentum holds despite the lyric density, aided by clear causal beats and an absence of obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. If anything, a small trim of descriptive flourishes in the middle could slightly sharpen pressure, but it doesn’t materially harm closure.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density in nearly every line ("grief had faded from serrated to dull"). There are no scaffold loops or wasted motion; the imagery of "silt" and "concentric ghosts" supports the central argument without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with standout images like the "black tongue of paper." There are minor moments of overwriting (e.g., "rising from stone to bone" creates a distracting rhyme), but the line-level craft generally supports the story’s atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished with high information density ("notation crawling across the screen like frost"). However, the density of "like" similes (drunk whale, poppies, wreckage, muscles, constellations, frost) becomes noticeable, creating a slight rhythmic scaffolding artifact that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("spidered with cracks," "shivered rainbows"). However, the density of similes (using "like" or "as if" frequently) occasionally draws attention to the writing mechanics rather than the image itself. The final line effectively ties the "chased stillness" motif to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("patient ghosts," "wind threaded through"). Imagery is consistently functional, advancing the narrative argument without ornamental loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose features strong, evocative imagery ("ribs showing under wet skin"), but is occasionally hampered by filter verbs ("began to notice," "felt his breathing," "saw not the boys body") that distance the reader during high-intensity moments. A few similes, while creative, border on being overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagery is marred by clunky phrasing like "retrocognitively trapped" and didactic sentences that stall the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ticket stubs like molted scales," "veneer... sunburned skin"), with strong rhythmic control. A few metaphors border on heavy ("city like an egg"), but the imagery consistently serves the atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout phrases like "careful calm of demolition" and "petals of metal." The density of figurative language is high ("leaking chemical light... like wounded dawn"), occasionally bordering on purple, but generally serves the synesthetic POV. Rhythm and flow support the contemplative pacing without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and often arresting ("cracked the air like a knuckle"), but the density of figurative language borders on overwriting in places ("destiny's door"). The technical logic of the photography metaphor ("brightened like film") falters, creating a coherence stumble in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    The text suffers from "simile churn," with a high density of "like" and "as if" constructions clogging the rhythm (e.g., "like undecided sentences," "like hesitant thoughts," "like a sleeping worm"). Additionally, a significant credibility break occurs when molten glass is poured over leather to create a "translucent spine"—physically, the leather would incinerate instantly. Prompt phrases are inserted clumsily ("thoughtfully spirited").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory details like "shredded call sheets the way kids stare at roadkill." Sentence rhythm supports the tension well, avoiding loops or artifacts while maintaining high information density throughout the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally crowds the action. The distinct repetition of "hush" ("marbled hush," "ambered hush") creates a distracting lexical artifact/loop.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("frost feathers," "reflected fractured"), maintaining high information density and strong rhythm without sacrificing clarity. The figurative language serves the tone specifically—the simile of time folding "like a custodian turning a page" is particularly apt—and there are no visible artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative but suffers from occasional heavy-handed personification ("beading condensation as though it had been sweating fear") and missing articles ("from projector housing"). The verb "braided" is repeated prominently (lines 2 and 24), creating a lexical echo that distracts. Rhythm is generally strong, though some metaphors clutter the clarity of action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical ("tiny storms caught in glass," "question mark slowly learning to become a sentence"). Imagery is fresh and does heavy lifting for the world-building. A few similes ("slumped like tired bureaucrats") are slightly less inventive than the rest, but the overall rhythm is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative and polished, but suffers from simile density and a specific repetition artifact ("Coils of superconductor gleamed like coiled frost"). The rhythm is smooth, though the reliance on "like" constructions occasionally slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with verbs doing heavy lifting ("pooled," "carved," "snag on silence"). Figurative language is fresh and cohesive ("planets around a drowned sun"), driving momentum without lapsing into purple prose or static description.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and evocative ("fragile, furred geometry"), though the density of figurative language is high. The mandated phrase "swallowed truth" appears four times, creating a repetitive refrain that borders on heavy-handedness, slightly stalling the otherwise excellent rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    While the prose contains high-density imagery ("city night clamps shut," "wearing a carnival crown"), the verbatim repetition of "religiously skeptical" constitutes a significant artifact. These echoes suggest a struggle with the prompt constraints that mars the otherwise polished and propulsive line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and rich, with strong rhythm and high information density. However, the density of figurative language (e.g., "echo tattooed beneath skin," "silence... inhaling courage") occasionally borders on overwriting, and the use of "via" in the description of the swan strikes a slight register dissonance with the otherwise timeless tone.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several mechanical slips mar the prose: missing apostrophes in possessives ("patients faces," "Alvarez free hand") and a distracting word echo ("nested... nest"). These errors undercut the polished literary tone aimed for.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("tides climbed stairs"), but suffers from occasional overwriting. The phrase "sensitively perceptive stubbornness" is a clunky adverb-adjective cluster that tells rather than shows, and some metaphors ("small storms") feel slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with excellent lines like "a name people choose when they want to be mistaken for stationery." Sentence rhythm is varied and propulsive. A few metaphors (e.g., "Morse run wild," "confession booth") are slightly dense but fit the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("dry chord that hung in the rafters like a question"). There is a slight tendency toward abstraction in the climax ("net cast through rhetorical devices," "strange attention"), where concrete action would have heightened the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally lush and high-density ("clicked like teeth in a zipper"), but the text suffers from a jarring recurring tense error. The phrase "before exhaustion hits" is inserted twice in the present tense within a past-tense narrative, creating a conspicuous grammatical artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control; "Time seemed pinned between the drop and the ripple" is a standout line. A few phrases lean toward abstraction ("broken electricity"), but the density and flow are high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "bitten by silence itself." A few phrases required by the prompt (e.g., "audibly muted light") feel slightly ornamental, but they are generally well-integrated into the poetic logic of the piece. The tactile descriptions of sound vibration are particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally high-density and lyrical, but a distracting stutter-step phrasing ("progressing by progressing laterally") mars the explanation of the map. Additionally, some passive phrasing in the opening ("It was after being followed...") slightly delays the hook.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," with a repetitive "verb + like + noun" structure appearing over six times ("trembling like captive moons," "clicked... like teeth," "clung... like breath," etc.), creating a predictable cadence. Additionally, a jarring tense error occurs in the final paragraph ("straightened as the transformation completes"), disrupting the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished and high-density but suffers from "purple" straining (e.g., "glared like a sentence waiting for its verb") and abstract labeling ("passionate subtlety"). While mechanically sound, the reliance on adjective-heavy telling reduces narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is density-rich and evocative ("smoke braided the stars"), with no scaffold or filler. While the phrase "unanswered questions" leans slightly generic, the recurring motif of the "hush" and the tactile descriptions of the greenhouse maintain high literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, but the climax suffers from figurative density; six consecutive sentences employ similes or metaphors ("like silver roots," "sharp as bitten glass," "like subtitles"), which slightly distances the reader from the visceral immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but marred by the clumsy verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") which act as adjectival clutter rather than organic description. There is a tendency toward filtering ("Elias felt," "He found her") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled but suffers from a density of abstract metaphors ("remembered rain," "catching other peoples fractures") that can feel overwrought. The final line's "new dialect of belonging one syllable at a time" tips into purple prose, prioritizing sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("Sound peeled away... like paint"). Imagery is consistent and serves the magical realism tone, though the density of simile in the middle section is high.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("leaves like dim hands cupping sound"). A minor artifact is the repetition of the distinct verb "dovetail" twice within a short space, which draws attention to the prompt insertion, but otherwise, the line-level craft is publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by occasional awkward phrasing ("pocketed shirt" instead of shirt pocket) and the grammatically disjointed insertion of the required method phrase. Some descriptions tilt toward purple ("letting the cold plastic kiss his skin"), though the sensory rhythm is often pleasing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally strong and lyrical ("jeweled the wire"), but the repetition of "circuitously sincere" constitutes a loop artifact. The final sentence leans into expository summary, dampening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, a distinct metaphor is repeated in close proximity ("cities stitched together" and "skein of rain stitched across"), creating a minor textual echo that disrupts the otherwise polished surface. The metaphor density is high ("gravid," "bruise," "vertebrae") but largely fits the painterly POV.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("lullaby sharpened by teeth"), but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally borders on purple ("Bright darkness dripped," "pulsed like sleeping hearts"). The mechanics are clean, but the high frequency of similes and adjectives slows momentum slightly in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery ("stuttering the music into silence," "eyes leaking the same water"). Rhythm is well-managed, mirroring the "staggered intervals" of the protagonist. A few phrases border on ornate, but the overall effect is polished and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose quality is high, with strong imagery ("indecisive stars," "wrung into fog") and a rhythmic flow that supports the dreamlike atmosphere. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and the density of information is good. No significant artifacts or loops impede the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like "memories tingled... like seaweed." The metaphor of the "unheard symphony" lands well, though the "city seen from orbit" simile feels slightly anachronistic against the village backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is high-density and polished, with inventive phrasing like "gravity had grown ideas" and "lawful mischief of distance." A few early descriptions (e.g., the beams braiding into rainbows/serpents) border on overwrought, but the rhythm and precision remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of artifacts; the metaphorical weight of the ink "liquefying rigid categories" is handled with precision. Line-level craft supports the story's "deathly vitality" without lapsing into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, using high-density imagery ("streets lie empty as paper," "bones of the observatory") that serves the stationer's perspective. Metaphors are consistent and enhance the atmosphere without becoming muddy. The pacing moves fluidly from the mechanical observation of the lamp to the imaginative expansion of the stories.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    A severe "Template Cadence" artifact pervades the text, with over a dozen sentences beginning with "He [verb]" (He walked, He studied, He decided, He moved, etc.), creating a monotonous rhythm. While the vocabulary is polished, the repetitive syntax and reliance on filter verbs ("He thought," "He realized") drag the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and generally evocative ("clung to the cliff like a barnacle," "patient spirals"). While the writing is high-quality, a few images lean slightly toward the familiar (e.g., "fluttering like startled birds"), preventing a top-tier score. However, the "dropped screw" simile and the description of the "slow rust" of shame show strong command of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and sensory density ("phosphorescent paint," "skeleton of drowned suburbs"). While the "investors... like sharks" simile is a bit cliché, the "foundation stone chip" warming against the chest provides a strong, tactile anchor for the internal conflict. Line-level momentum is maintained well despite the summary passages.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong sensory imagery ("dry, thin vibration," "knife-edged away"). The line "light would remember what pressure erased" effectively synthesizes the story's physics and metaphysics. A few phrases like "velvet dark" lean slightly conventional, but the overall craft is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm ("braid with the distant horns"). There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Elias felt," "He oversaw") that distances the reader momentarily. The imagery is generally fresh, avoiding cliché, though the "heartfelt artisan" descriptor is a bit of a tell.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is high with no scaffold loops; imagery like "atlas proofs spread like fallen feathers" tightly serves the central motif. The rhythm modulates well between the stillness of the outpost and the tension of the ice trek.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from high simile density (over 8 uses of "like" in a short space), creating a repetitive syntactic pattern that clutters the imagery. While individual images are lovely ("frozen applause"), the cumulative effect is ornamental rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs ("spat out coordinates," "flickered hungry green") and rhythmic control. The sentence utilizing the required phrase "overriding instinct" is slightly tautological ("overrode every caution by overriding instinct"), but the overall execution remains high-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("oars clicking like teeth"), sustaining the gothic tone without succumbing to abstraction. Occasional adjective stacking ("exhausted bruise," "salt-shot stone") slightly slows momentum but fits the textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, but specific required phrases like "ephemeral cameo appearances" are integrated clumsily, creating a jarring anachronism that disrupts the otherwise seamless gothic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. There are minor moments of overwriting ("hauntingly optimistic slowness" is a heavy modifier stack) and some prompt insertions feel slightly grafted ("orchid solace"). Overall, the imagery is precise ("dust falls like flour") and propels the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but prone to stock literary phrasing ("breathing as if for the first time," "something in Rafi's shoulders eased"). Metaphors are sometimes mixed or overwrought ("clouds shredded open" clashes with the gentle "thin sunbeam"), reducing line-level clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("soft hiss of disappearing trains," "braided all the earlier attempts"), with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. The imagery consistently supports the thematic weight without becoming purple or obstructing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with high information density and strong rhythm ("boots scraping stone"). Metaphors are generally effective ("shadow... like an eclipse that refused to leave"), though occasionally dense. The line-level craft successfully supports the magical realism tone without drifting into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally high-density and evocative, but suffers from a significant repetition artifact: the specific phrase "fierce tenderness" appears twice verbatim within a short space, breaking immersion. Additionally, "un writing" appears as a spacing error or typo (likely intended as "unwriting" or "un-writing"). These slips mar an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("inked exhaustion," "sedimentary scars") with high information density. While the figurative language is heavy in the climax ("lotus-hearted ache," "muddy blooms"), it remains coherent within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and high-density, with strong imagery ("captured dawn," "ghostly apples"). However, there is a slight reliance on simile constructions ("like ribs," "like lungs," "like exposed film") that occasionally draws attention away from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose has strong rhythm and density, with some lovely imagery ("stone ribs," "carved face all questions"). However, some metaphors are overwrought or slightly mixed ("scraping soot from a drowned sun"), and the simile "like a question wearing my voice" borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but the opening paragraph relies on a stack of similes ("like bottled moons," "like impatient typewriters," "like an overworked altar boy") that creates a noticeable scaffold artifact, stalling momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the insertion of required phrasing caused a significant stumble ("carried via... carried on"). Additionally, some metaphorical constructions ("reef-shadow joy") hover on the edge of abstraction, reducing clarity for the sake of aesthetics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    High-density prose with standout imagery like "seeds to fur." A few phrases lean on cliché ("images rose unbidden") or slightly strained metaphor ("thorn in foxglove regret"), which prevents a higher score. Rhythm and sentence variety are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("distilled residue of a hundred obsolete dyes"). The writing maintains density and momentum, avoiding scaffold, though a few phrases lean slightly toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied. The recurring phrase "as the building breathes" creates a strong cadence, though its present tense creates a slight friction with the past tense narrative that feels intentional but noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally evocative and dense, though occasionally tips into overwriting with phrases like "delayed flame of memory lick at him." The transitional phrase "Across learning to trust again" reads as a scaffold artifact, momentarily disrupting the otherwise high-quality line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery like cornfields as "fingerprints the world was still trying to remember." The prompt-mandated phrase "featherly determined" is the only slight rhythm bump, feeling momentarily awkward against the otherwise polished syntax. Overall, the prose propels the story with precision and beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("floodlights combed," "pale suits licking back the gloom") with excellent rhythm. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike, underwater tone without sacrificing clarity. Minor risk of adjective density in phrases like "softly ingenious," but it fits the established style.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and dense, but two significant grammatical errors involving the word "transliterates" (subject-verb disagreement and a jarring tense shift) disrupt the flow. These basic mechanics issues undermine an otherwise polished style.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("guitars hum in sympathy," "tide licked the tiles"), maintaining strong rhythm and momentum. A few metaphors lean slightly purple ("seashell pressed to the cosmos"), but the line-level craft generally supports the magical realist tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished, it suffers from metaphor stacking and occasional accidental rhymes ("shore of before") that disrupt the rhythm. The density of adjectives and "noun-of-noun" constructions occasionally clogs the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose suffers from metaphor stacking ("boats looked like erased sketches," "colors floated... like thoughts," "clipboard wrapped... as if the future"). The density of figurative language in nearly every paragraph draws attention to the writing itself, slowing momentum and occasionally obscuring the immediate action. A tighter edit would let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes (8+ instances of "like" or "as" in ~500 words), creating a repetitive "template cadence" that distracts (e.g., "like a watchful eye," "like embers," "like a second heart," "like tiny planets"). Additionally, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases results in clunky, abstract sentences that break the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose quality is high, with dense, evocative imagery ("stone eyelid," "wavering constellations") that serves the atmosphere. Rhythm is well-controlled, particularly in the climax where the "hush roared" and the needle "shuddered." There is a slight risk of metaphor congestion in the opening, but it establishes the genre expectations quickly. The parallel structure of "waves braided the moonlight; inside, probabilities braided themselves" is an effective stylistic choice that mirrors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "petals touched by frost." However, the integration of the method prompt ("I knew the building wanted to speak through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace...") creates a visible seam, resulting in a clumsy, synthetic sentence that disrupts the otherwise polished flow. Without this artifact, the score would be significantly higher.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("tinted faintly like light seen through wet glass"). The rhythm supports the magical realism tone well. Minor deduction for the repetitive use of the specific prompt phrase "perceptively calm" in both narration and dialogue attribution.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density throughout. However, the density of figurative language in the opening paragraphs (similes involving gods, animals, armor, coins) slightly threatens momentum by drawing attention to the writing itself. Despite this, the line-level craft is strong, with no scaffold loops or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; lines like "ghost vein in a bleached hand" do double duty for imagery and theme without slowing momentum. Only minor poeticisms ("wept itself dry") prevent a perfect score, but the rhythm and precision are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm is controlled, but the text suffers from "purple" density and abstract metaphors that obscure physical reality (e.g., "posture into punctuation," "bodily poetic"). While the imagery is evocative, the reliance on abstraction for key actions dilutes the immediacy of the scene. Repetitive phrasing ("between sigh and smile") feels more like a forced motif than a natural refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ink dries fastest when people below are on fire"), though the metaphor of "glow worms of insight" leans slightly toward the ornamental. The rhythm effectively mirrors the "meteor hush" and the tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm (e.g., "broken rhythm of gust and lull"). The repetition of "blushing stillness" acts as a lyric frame, though its specificity makes the recurrence slightly conspicuous. Line-level craft is otherwise polished, with active verbs and fresh metaphors ("wings trembling like paper in a slow-burning fire") driving the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose density is high with memorable imagery ("yellowed tongue," "faces smoother than erased inscriptions"). There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in moments of intensity ("snowmelt ardor," "technically gentle"), but the rhythm and syntax generally propel the story well. The synthesis of sound and physical casting terminology is executed with craft.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    While the prose contains lovely distinct phrases like "rain rehearsing in the leaves," the density of similes is high, and some rely on clichés ("crawled under his skin like ants," "rolled like boulders"). These standard comparisons detract slightly from the otherwise high-quality lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("pleasure of data," "indifferent god"). Imagery is generally precise, though "beams rose like invisible columns" teeters on the edge of contradictory description given the dusty air. Overall, the line-level craft supports the story's high-concept ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and dense, with strong sensory imagery. However, a tendency toward overwrought metaphors ("trapped horizons," "campaigns of compassion," "light as a forgotten promise") occasionally distracts from the immediacy of the scene. The rhythm is generally good.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("teeth from a shattered smile"). The rhythm supports the ritualistic pacing, though a few similes ("bent like a snapped twig") are functional rather than dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the imagery is lush, the prose suffers from adjective-adverb clutter ("endearingly feisty certainty," "unfamiliar, unsettling colors"). The explicit articulation of the lesson learned ("accidental wisdom") in the final sentence reduces the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally high-quality and dense, with strong imagery. However, a few phrases feel slightly overwrought or like prompt insertions (e.g., "brightened disquiet," "simply complicated"). These abstract descriptors briefly dilute the otherwise concrete sensory experience of the orchard and bathroom.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the imagery is often lush, the prose suffers from noticeable repetitive phrasing (e.g., "unheard symphony" used twice, "carefully resourceful" used twice as a tag). These artifacts break the immersive quality expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery like "rust running backward like water." A few moments lean toward abstraction ("invisible cages," "narrative threads"), but the line-level craft generally supports the magical realist tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery ("wood shivered open," "frost taking shape"). Momentum is steady, though a few filter verbs ("Lysa felt," "Lysa thought") slightly distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience in the mechanism room.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong images like "rain carried voices that never quite learned how to be rain." Minor clichés ("bruised, exhausted sky") and abstract logic ("mapping grammar against heart") prevent a higher score, but the rhythm is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is rich and precise, with high information density in lines like "preserved like an insect in ambered quiet." The imagery is consistently evocative, driving the narrative momentum without stalling in static description, though a few phrases skirt the edge of being ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the imagery is evocative ("clear as breath on a winter window"), the prose suffers significantly from a repetitive "He [verb]" sentence scaffold (over 15 instances). This syntactic drone creates a template-like cadence that undermines the story's momentum and lyrical aspirations, requiring substantial variation for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("metal mouths waiting to shout," "exhaling gardens"). Minor phrasing slips like "literally blooms" (a weak intensifier) and some dense metaphor stacking ("spring-loading fear") slightly disrupt the otherwise polished rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally exceptional, with high density and evocative imagery ("barnacles like shut eyes"). A repetition artifact exists where "difficult conversation" appears in two adjacent sentences, slightly stalling the momentum, but otherwise, the craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "irony poured like concrete." Metaphors are generally strong ("silence... like invisible dew"). The required phrase "intangibly tangible" is handled well within the epiphany, though the phrase itself is inherently clunky; the surrounding craft supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The writing is polished and rhythmic ("soft as a dropped coin"), maintaining strong atmospheric density. Minor repetitions of "sigh" (carriage, courier, gondola) and "tremble" (air, terrace, line) occur but do not significantly distract from the overall flow.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high with evocative imagery ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "capillaries") that advances the story. The phrasing around the required elements ("wisely adventurous enough to sally forth") is a minor rhythmic stumble, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with moments of strong imagery ("warmer than her fingers, as though someone had just let go"). However, the verbatim repetition of the long phrase "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" at the beginning and end reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than a natural refrain, creating a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every sentence. Lines like "stray metaphor risked congealing into something with teeth" demonstrate excellent control of imagery without slipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally high-quality and dense, though there is a noticeable reliance on "like [noun]" simile constructions (dust like constellations, horn like a flower, crisp as frost). The repetition of the unique phrase "eloquently silent" within a short space reads as a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("ink bruised into violet dusk," "constellations as small, steady wounds"), maintaining momentum while carrying a heavy image load. The writing is polished and rhythmic, avoiding scaffold artifacts, though the high density of figurative language nears the ceiling for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but leans on adjectival clusters ("tactfully hopeful," "tired gleam") and repetition of the prompt verb "unfurl" (three times). The rhythm is generally good, though the summary sections lack the propulsion of the specific scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("sunken star," "jazz smuggled"). Rhythm is controlled and propulsive. A minor typo ("Lios angle") and a few slightly standard descriptors in the lagoon scene prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, though occasionally overwrought with stacked metaphors ("weeping mineral tears," "scratch their slow handwriting"). The sensory details are vivid but sometimes crowd the sentence logic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("answers felt sturdier when anchored to breath"), with high information density. The integration of the awkward required phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" creates a slight rhythmic stumble, and "mossy delight tingling" leans slightly into synesthetic abstraction, but the overall line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Imagery like "ink running like rivers seeking new courses" serves the story well, maintaining a strong rhythm from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is propulsive and dense with imagery ("solder for Arlen's fractured story," "carrying her refusal like another lantern"). A slight dip occurs with the phrase "factually mystical," which reads as a clunky modifier amidst otherwise showing-based descriptions, but the overall craft is extremely high.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and imagery ("layered so tightly that sorrow and giggle were indistinguishable"). However, it occasionally tips into overwriting with stacked metaphors ("bruised harmonies," "luminous ache") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader slightly from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("discarded question mark"). However, the repetition of the polysyllabic phrase "proprioceptively enhanced" feels slightly clunky, and the density of metaphor occasionally threatens to obscure the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the imagery is often striking ("pocketed star"), the text suffers from multiple punctuation errors, specifically missing possessive apostrophes ("markets outermost rail," "alchemists rustling shifts," "magistrates patience") and missing hyphens ("moth eaten"). Occasional phrasing leans toward the vague or oxymoronic ("elusively tangible").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with visceral imagery like wires humming like "entrails." However, the integration of the prompt phrase "began when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" creates a jarring tense clash (began/dies) that momentarily disrupts the otherwise smooth past-tense narration.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled ("tasted like falling and arrival at once"). However, the climax relies on a cluster of "as if" and "as though" similes to describe the transformation, scaffolding the imagery rather than embodying it directly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong imagery ("curtains pooled like spilled years"). However, a high frequency of "like [noun]" similes (8 instances) creates a slight pattern artifact that draws attention to the writing mechanics over the image in places.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without becoming purple; images like the "smaller morning" and "lies flaked away like scabs" are striking and precise. The rhythm supports the magical realism tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically sound, with strong sensory imagery ("ghost remembering its body"). A few similes lean toward the generic ("teeth of a patient beast"), but the line-level density is generally high and devoid of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery, though it occasionally leans on "telling" artifacts to bridge transitions ("It felt less like being lost," "She had followed"). These scaffold phrases reduce the immediacy of the line-level experience, but the rhythm remains propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("windows... like eyes after tears"), maintaining a strong rhythm. A few phrases border on the precious ("fragile card," "unlit glass"), but the "dawning hush" framing device is effectively deployed to unify the opening and closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, but significant proofreading failures undermine the literary pretension. Three distinct possessive errors ("someone elses," "diarys," "Mariss") and an awkward tense shift ("Tonight began after the letters are found") disrupt the reading experience. These basic mechanical flaws prevent the piece from meeting the "flawless" publication standard despite strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative with zero wasted motion. Images like "machine of brass and void" and "cloudy as old tea" do heavy lifting for world-building efficiently. Rhythm and syntax support the reflective yet urgent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, maintaining high momentum through the ritual description. The opening "shuddering sigh trembled" borders on tautology, and "thin as spider silk" is a minor cliché, but the writing is otherwise precise and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    While individual images are strong ("rang like frozen bells"), the prose relies heavily on "like/as" simile constructions. This high density creates a repetitive syntactic cadence that distracts from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with standout images like "glue... like fossilized sap" and "pressure jittering like a plucked string." The rhythm supports the tension well. The final image of the "uncertain heart" is a slightly standard trope compared to the freshness of the rest, but the overall execution is polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from filter verb stacking in the climax ("He saw," "He felt," "He realized") and metaphor congestion ("like a throat," "like crushed nebulae"). These artifacts create distance exactly when the text should be most immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("soldering saints and suns"), with strong rhythm and imagery. A minor deduction for the repetition of the specific phrase "contextual clues" (used twice), which feels slightly clinical against the lyrical backdrop. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and supports the story's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("breathing like a sleeping animal," "calendars peeled off the walls"). Imagery is generally strong and functional, though occasionally borders on slightly overwrought ("algae of ages," "dreamed in echoes"), which holds it back from the highest band. Rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the pooling and flowing of time described in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished but dense with metaphor loops ("loss... was a door," "gesture enter him like a line of unwritten verse") that slow momentum. The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("opalescent," "bruised violet") creates a static, ornamental texture. Rhythm is controlled, but the constant poetic signaling reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("clock chiming underwater"), establishing a strong mood. A few metaphors border on the precious ("vowels rounded by leaves"), but the rhythm generally supports the fable-like tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense and propulsive, achieving high information density without scaffold artifacts or filler. Imagery is consistently fresh and character-specific ("old telescopes," "silence of cooled metal"), serving both the atmosphere and the intellectual precision of the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("braided the air," "low language of salt"). Information density is high with minimal scaffold. A few instances of filter verbs in the final beat ("He imagined the battlefield") distance the reader slightly from the image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid but relies on a repetitive cadence of similes ("like a rusted constellation," "like bottled sunset," "like smoke," "like footnotes"), which becomes noticeable. One sentence ("lay hidden by reading...") is syntactically awkward due to prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Imagery is striking ("slice diagonally across the field like a closing eyelid," "hum... lowered to a reverent whisper"). The line-level craft supports the time-distortion theme through pacing and syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally dense with metaphor ("throat full of prophecy"). While lines like "colors that had no names" are tropey, original images like the "decapitated" wind keep the texture engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density in every sentence. Phrases like "morgue drawer for expendability" and "benevolently ruthless" show distinct stylistic control. The repetition of "luminous absence" at the beginning and end functions as a purposeful refrain rather than a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. Imagery is lush ("air itself read like marginalia"), though occasionally the metaphor density threatens to slow momentum. Line-level craft is otherwise polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("boots ringing no echo," "captured lightning bolt"). The rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing during the description of the freeze and accelerating slightly at the release. Minor abstraction in the climax ("sifted his motives") is the only slight drag on an otherwise sharp delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("stacking causes and effects like bones"). However, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "innocently mischievous" (once for chimes, once for posture) is a visible artifact that breaks the otherwise high polish. Without this slip, the score would be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by the repetitive and somewhat forced insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "dire enchantment" used twice as a modifier). Some metaphors are mixed or overly dense ("smell etched cauterized paths through his thoughts"), which can obscure clarity in favor of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and vivid metaphorical capacity ("narrowed like lungs"). However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction or melodrama ("spiderweb fractures dividing yesterday from now"), and the density of interior reflection sometimes stalls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("mist slipped... like breath"), but relies frequently on "like" and "as if" similes to carry descriptions. Phrasing is polished, though the "adjective and adjective" rhythm ("blunt and heavy," "sluggish and mean") becomes noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and evocative ("timbre like a borrowed coat"), achieving high information density. However, the density of "like/as" similes—appearing roughly every few sentences—creates a detectable artifact that slightly drags on the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("chewed its walls," "wooden seed pod"), maintaining strong momentum without drag. The prose is polished and high-density, though the phrase "rational truffle forager" feels slightly utilitarian against the surrounding lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like the "lantern caged in rust" driving momentum. A few metaphors lean toward cliché ("shivered like a living thing") or pathetic fallacy ("refused to admit"), but the overall rhythm and information density are high.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("precise as ink," "spinning constellations"), though it occasionally veers into overwriting ("damp, fragrant mouths"). Information density is high, and there are no significant mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is polished, but the density of similes (over a dozen in a short piece) creates a repetitive "X like Y" cadence that drags on the pacing. The imagery is vivid ("cobwebs strung with teeth"), but the structural repetition of the comparisons becomes a text artifact that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythm and sensory detailing ("clink of the experiment beginning"). A few metaphors lean slightly precious ("gin fizz got louder just to hear"), but the overall control and lack of scaffold justify a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and rich with original imagery ("feral nostalgia" is a standout). A few slightly standard phrases ("stars are close enough to touch," "gravity loosens its fingers") are the only artifacts preventing a top-tier score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from simile density ("like hesitant confession," "like a quiet wave," "like captured breath," "like river deltas"). This reliance on "like/as" constructions and Adjective-Noun pairings ("trembling calm," "blurred smudge") creates a manufactured lyricism that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but suffers from density and overwriting; metaphors are stacked heavily ("robes pooled like ink," "sky pressed its ear," "ribbon of vapor... like trapped moths"), which occasionally slows momentum. The phrasing of the prompt elements is sometimes inserted as rigid exposition rather than smoothed into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative without stalling momentum. Lines like "wind made mechanical" and "bark could pray" show high craft. The imagery consistently serves the tone, and there are no visible loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose quality is exceptional, with high information density and striking imagery (galaxies blinking out "like a sentence rewritten with stricter punctuation"). The rhythm supports the pacing of the ritual, and there are no visible scaffold artifacts or repetitive phrasing loops.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and strong momentum. Imagery is consistently evocative, though a few metaphors (e.g., "bleeding filaments") skirt the edge of overwriting while maintaining the surreal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is vivid ("breath feathering white"), but the prose suffers from repetitive reuse of prompt phrases ("quiet wildfire," "familiar strangers," "revolutionize," "spatially gifted" all appear multiple times), creating a checklist effect that drags on the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose quality is high, with dense imagery and rhythmic variance ("stunned gray of late November," "ink feathered like little ferns"). The writing is polished and avoids major artifacts. A few phrasings are slightly overwrought ("words catching like chips between teeth"), but overall the line-level craft supports the literary tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "insomnia like a room with no doors" and "coiled cord heavy as a chain." Information density is high, and the text avoids scaffold or filter artifacts, maintaining propulsion through the lyrical style.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and dense with high-quality imagery ("bruising is how paper remembers pressure"). The line-level craft supports the magical realism without confusion. While heavily stylized, the figurative language remains coherent and serves the story’s atmospheric logic without slipping into purple muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("elbows gone white," "vanished like a politely closed parentheses"). Rhetorical repetitions ("mismatched... mismatched," "truest thing... truest thing") are used effectively for emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("sap-slow grammar," "cloth stretched to transparency"). The line-level craft supports the magical realism without becoming cluttered or confusing, and the sensory descriptions are fresh. No significant artifacts or loops impede the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "falling and floating negotiated an uneasy truce." There is a slight tendency toward abstraction ("trajectories of moments"), but the high density of imagery generally supports the literary sci-fi tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like a bowl," "like underlining," "like a violin," "like a fabric," "like a chord"). While individual images are lovely, the cumulative effect borders on overwriting and slows momentum. The line-level craft is otherwise clean, with good rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. The "volcanic tenderness" line, while arguably purple, is well-integrated into the voice. Imagery is specific ("unwilling torch," "patient heart"), maintaining momentum without unnecessary scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from significant simile fatigue, with over ten "like" or "as if" constructions in a short space ("like a knot," "like whispered sentences," "like a secret," "like a white river"). This repetitive syntactical pattern creates a drumbeat rhythm that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with clear imagery, though phrases like "thoughts stacked themselves with surgical precision" rely on cliché. The "ribbon of intention" metaphor stack in the climax is slightly overwrought but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative; "shutters clacked like teeth" is a standout image that links character to action. The required phrase "spiralingly calm" is woven in smoothly despite its awkward nature, and the rhythm supports the water imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant artifacts or loops. Phrasing like "stubborn as a pawn" and "rustled like dry leaves" serves the story's imagery without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("measured as a tide," "apologizing for every scrape"), though it occasionally leans into adjective-heavy description. The final sentence disrupts the rhythmic control by inserting an abstract summary of the character's motivation. No significant mechanical slips or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong imagery ("sank and rose like a slow comet," "petals were blades"). The choice to omit quotation marks fits the "hush" aesthetic well. A few phrasings border on slightly ornamental ("heroic reduction of unnecessary volume"), but the line-level craft generally supports the story’s atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, particularly in descriptions of sound ("answering the pressure of footsteps"). Some metaphors stack heavily ("smoke rose like punctuation"), creating slight density drag, but the line-level craft is generally strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("sketching trembling constellations," "sleeping insect"), creating a strong atmosphere without stalling momentum. While imagery is rich, it serves the story's mythic tone, avoiding the trap of purely ornamental writing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and dense with synesthetic imagery ("tasted of tin and river fog"), though occasionally borders on overwritten ("water trying to remember being rain"). The pacing is controlled, though the insertion of the required word "propel" in dialogue feels slightly stiff.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished and dense with imagery ("consciousness printed into polymer circuits," "loom where unspoken wants were woven"). There are moments of slight overwriting where metaphors stack heavily ("chandelier of ghosts," "teaching withering to bloom"), but the prose generally maintains momentum and clarity. The visual imagery of the climax is particularly strong, even if the plot mechanics behind it are weak.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("scarred wooden floorboards," "onyx-ink sigil"). Rhythm is well-managed, though some phrasing feels slightly self-conscious or writerly in its precision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lush and propulsive, with strong imagery. However, there are minor artifacts of repetition, such as "bronze prism" followed closely by "bronzed violet," and the prompt phrase "anguished joy" appearing verbatim twice (once mid-story, once at closure), which creates a slight lexical loop. The rhythm and density are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose rhythm is generally strong, the text contains multiple punctuation errors, specifically missing apostrophes in possessives ("librarys," "peoples," "Lios," "Lanes"). These systemic mechanical failures severely undermine the polish required for professional publication.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery, though the middle section suffers from density issues due to the heavy backstory telling. Occasional stock phrases like "silver tongue" and "voice rough as river stones" detract slightly from the otherwise specific lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("smell of rain trapped in cloth," "crater seen from orbit"). The recurring "meteor hush" frame provides structural elegance. Sentence rhythm is varied and propulsive, with no significant loop artifacts or scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and imagery-rich ("rain braided the neon," "images slid against her mind"). The writing maintains strong momentum and rhythm without scaffold artifacts, effectively supporting the story's magical realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but dense with figurative language that sometimes muddies the image (e.g., a "careful bruise" is a confusing simile). The high density of metaphors in the climax slows the momentum where directness would have heightened the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically precise, with high information density and no scaffold. Images like "possibility on silence" and "schedules curling like burnt leaves" are striking and fresh. The integration of technical terms like "wave functions" into the poetic texture is daring and mostly successful, creating a unique "quantum-mythic" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Simile density is distracting, with ~9 instances of "like" or "as" comparisons ("like dark rain," "like a sweater," "like fog") creating a repetitive scaffold. This reliance on figurative language distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a density of similes that distracts from the action; nearly every noun carries a modifier or comparison ("like weathered rope," "stooped as a question mark," "like a bell"). This figurative clutter softens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, but marred by the repetition of the distinct phrase "seraphically mundane" (once for the guest, once for the narrator), which feels like a forced prompt insertion. Occasional strained metaphors ("ribs bending like bad questions") detract slightly from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("stars hung like thoughts someone had forgotten to finish"). There is a slight reliance on simile chains ("like the cage," "like a forest," "like small, mute moons") in the opening, but the writing sharpens significantly as the action progresses. The final sentence is rhythmically excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though slightly reliant on simile constructions ("like a tired lung," "like fever," "like distant anchors," "like a jellyfish") which creates a repetitive cadence in the descriptive setup. Minor lexical echoes ("storms grew teeth" and "spared teeth") detract slightly from an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("serenity with teeth," "votive candles"), though it occasionally leans into density that borders on overwriting. The "thunderous serenity" integration is smooth. Line-level momentum is generally good, though a few abstract phrases ("possibility of coherence") slow the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally high-density and propulsive, with fresh imagery ("leaf-thoughts... like dripping resin") that avoids cliché. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the tension, and the text is free of loop artifacts or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Imagery like "waves chewed at the black rocks... grinding teeth" is visceral and effective. A slight reliance on simile constructions ("like smoke," "like a second sun," "like rocks") prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is rhythmically strong but occasionally suffers from metaphor density ("hinges twisted like something that had drowned") that strains clarity. "Audible hush" is a minor cliché, but the integration of the required tone phrase is handled naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verbs ("whining," "slogged"). A few metaphors border on mixed or abstract ("bruised memory of the eclipse" is evocative but logically slippery), but the line-level craft generally supports the high-concept premise well.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong imagery ("creases mapped a history"). Rhythm is well-managed. Deductions apply for the mixed metaphor in "perfume of dust and shattered promises" (concrete/abstract mix) and the prompt-forced telling of "bravely conflicted," but the overall line-level craft is publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("fractures in the earth," "whisper") and rhythmic control. The density of adjectives slows momentum in places, but the prose generally supports the story's meditative pacing without mechanical loops.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive, with high-quality metaphors ("shuffling their stars like hands") that serve the atmosphere without clogging the pacing. Line-level craft is nearly flawless, avoiding artifacts and ensuring that every description advances the reader’s understanding of the world or the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("swallowing skyscrapers," "words fall into her like stones"). The "typesetter tongues a bitten lip" simile is a standout example of character-specific imagery. A minor deduction for the rhythmic stutter in "observant as ever, devotedly observant," which reads as a text-insertion artifact rather than natural syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled ("opens like a throat in the dark"). A few similes ("like trapped fireflies") feel slightly standard compared to the otherwise fresh imagery, but line-level momentum is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality verbs ("oxidize," "gnawed") driving the imagery. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("gentle, lilac unease"), but the overall control is high-band. The line-level craft successfully supports the magical realism of the premise without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but overly reliant on simile scaffolds ("like iron," "like broken reeds," "like double exposure," "like a hook," "like soot"), creating a repetitive cadence. While the imagery is often beautiful, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum and borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and strong rhythmic propulsion. Phrases like "shattered light like cymbals" and "sighed itself back into magic" demonstrate a mastery of imagery that serves the story's logic. There are no wasted sentences or scaffolding artifacts; the prose drives the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("crackling white," "mica facets"), maintaining strong momentum. A few phrases feel slightly overwrought ("willowglass hope," "fragile memory waiting to be spoken"), but the line-level craft is generally polished.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is evocative ("slow, silent auroras," "ribs of an ancient whale"), but sentence initiators become repetitive in the middle section ("Iri knelt," "Iri read," "Iri realized," "Iri followed"). This creates a staccato rhythm that drags slightly against the fluid tone.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally polished with high image density and good rhythm, avoiding major loops or scaffolding. The score is held back by the awkward grammatical integration of the required phrase "as the truth unravels," which clashes with the established past tense ("rehearsed... as the truth unravels").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwritten with heavy metaphors ("skeleton of some stranded mechanical whale"). The repetition of the phrasing "prudently daring" feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("nose out of the gray like an erasure"). However, the inclusion of the "rain gutters" prompt element feels slightly scaffolded, explaining a habit via negation rather than immediate sensory fact. Some metaphors ("more memory than breath") lean slightly toward melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the imagery is often strong, the prose suffers from a visible tense-shift artifact caused by the forced insertion of a required element ("watching as chimney smoke flattens"). Additionally, the repetition of the distinct phrase "phototropic to kindness" twice within a short space diminishes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("masts write faint calligraphy"), maintaining strong rhythm. While the insertion of prompt-specific phrases is occasionally conspicuous, the surrounding imagery absorbs them well, creating a coherent textural pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric (&quot;shelves drift like anchored ships&quot;), maintaining good momentum and density. The phrase &quot;atomically reflective&quot; clashes slightly with the fantasy tone but is handled cleanly; overall line-level craft is solid with few artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally lush and precise, with high information density and strong rhythm ("thin as spider silk and strong as braided steel"). However, the sentence "Through public art installation, the city hopes..." suffers from a missing determiner, creating a jarring artifact that momentarily disrupts the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythmic control ("power play written in radio ink"), driving momentum effectively. A minor deduction for the "hiss like snakes in deep grass" simile, which feels slightly idiomatic compared to the fresh imagery elsewhere, but overall line-level craft is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative but suffers from "simile fatigue" (e.g., "like accusations," "like prison bars," "like wounded wings," "like a buried lung"), creating a repetitive syntactic scaffold. The phrase "kneelt his balance" appears to be a usage error or typo that disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-quality with strong density and rhythm. Images like "flashlight beam cutting through the mist like a skeptical finger" are evocative. There are no significant loops or artifacts. The line-level craft supports the atmospheric tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "walls sweated" and "currents that walked." The line-level craft is high, though the final stanza of the story drifts slightly into summary/explanation rather than maintaining the sharp, immediate imagery of the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "telling" artifacts and clichés, specifically the "gift and curse" sentence and the convenient naming of the glass flake. The text relies on adjective-heavy description that occasionally slows momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally evocative, but a significant repetition artifact ("dusk thickened into a kind of dusky harmony") disrupts the immersion at a key transition. The phrase "polished calm" is repeated, though this reads as a deliberate framing device rather than an error.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and image-rich ("daylily-pressed telegram," "inscriptions shimmering like breath"), maintaining a strong, quiet rhythm throughout. There is a tendency toward "purple" description ("clocks surrendered to midnight") that occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over directness, but the line-level craft is generally assured.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("lodged like a bone in its throat"), driving momentum. The opening simile ("sharp as broken promises") leans slightly into melodrama, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("tasted like rain that never fell"), with strong rhythm. However, the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "anxious elation" as a label in the climax creates a visible artifact that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("splinters"), but the forced repetition of "trammeling" creates a visible artifact. The simile "roots usually trammel rocks" feels awkward and breaks the physical logic of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("growled past," "insulating himself... with facts"). However, the final sentence relies on a filter verb ("He felt") and abstract summary, which weakens the line-level impact at the crucial closing moment. The diagnostic sentence about loss in the middle also drags on momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong imagery like "plowing of her reality" and "arteries of the magnetic arbor." The integration of the required phrase "thinking through analogical thinking" is slightly tautological, representing a minor blemish in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished, there is a heavy reliance on simile ("like a misprinted page," "the way seabirds," "like scales," "like fish," "like startled minnows," "like mismatched volumes"). This repetitive syntactic scaffold distances the reader from the imagery in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is strong, the prose suffers from visible prompt-insertion artifacts. Several distinct phrases ("during the heartbeat of a hesitation," "acquired abandoned hopes") appear twice in identical form, suggesting a lack of polishing. The line "carved those confessions via confessions etched" contains a grammatical stumble that disrupts a pivotal description.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring ("smell of bleach and ghosts"). However, a few zeugmas and abstractions ("overgrown with ivy and apologies," "waiting for my consent to matter") teeter on the edge of being overwrought, slightly drawing attention to the author rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with excellent phrasings like &quot;lantern carried by the world&quot; and &quot;dragging chains across the carpet of the air.&quot; The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the &quot;hesitant seesaw&quot; of the watch, demonstrating strong control over line-level craft without lapsing into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with striking imagery ("contract folded like a paper guillotine"). However, the metaphor density is high, and "black as eclipse residue" reads as a slight figurative muddle amidst otherwise precise language. The rhythm and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, creating a rich texture with strong imagery like "drink starlight like blood." Rhythm is generally excellent, though a few filter verbs ("Elara recognized," "She began") and participle openers prevent a flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with mixed or abstract metaphors ("light behaved like water poured backward," "climb the rumor"). Some "telling" phrases ("betrayal unspeakable") reduce impact, but the rhythm is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong sensory details ("restless and salt heavy"). A few moments border on overwriting ("nuance itself had finally found a welcome perch"), but the line-level density and rhythm generally support the story's contemplative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("slower than rust, slower than apology"), effectively supporting the fable-like tone. Minor friction arises from the cliché "minutes or hours later, she could not say," but overall information density and rhythm are high-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery like "a tool... was a sentence the past tried to finish." The rhythm of the prose mirrors the skimming stones—precise, rhythmic, and settling into a resonant silence without reliance on scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery like "thoughts curled up like burned paper." The pacing accelerates effectively as Orren climbs, matching the tension. There are no scaffold artifacts or clichés; the "brilliant dimness" oxymoron works well to establish the magical atmosphere. (Score capped by Q2&lt;9.0 per high-band gate rules).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally evocative and dense, but the forced insertion of the prompt phrase "by wandering purposefully" creates a syntactic stumble. The climax leans on filter verbs that dilute the immediacy of the character's epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally high-density and propulsive, with no visible scaffolding or loops. Images like "coins... glimmered like guilty witnesses" and "motion itself had been wounded" are striking and functional. The rhythm supports the tension well, slowing appropriately at the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and high-density, though occasionally reliant on passive realizations ("He understood at once," "He believed that"). Some filtering distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience, but the imagery of the "crystalline reefs" is executed with sharp clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the imagery is dense and evocative, three missing possessive apostrophes ("last nights," "teachers sighs," "worlds balance") and a jarring tense shift ("is caught") preclude immediate publishability. These basic proofreading failures mar an otherwise beautifully written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative ("mirrored hush," "furred with algae"), though the opening "midnight ridgeway at twilight" creates a jarring temporal contradiction. Occasional metaphors ("gray fingers") lean toward cliché, but the overall texture is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is dense with abstract metaphors that often muddle the imagery ("branches woven like equations," "blossom a variable," "unanswered hypothesis swaying"). This "metaphor chocking" slows the pacing and feels performative. The high density of "X of Y" constructions ("equations of light," "chemistry of perception") creates a pseudo-profound register that feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally dense and vivid, with strong sensory detailing like "pulling splinters." However, the phrase "eyes attentively inventive" reads as a forced prompt insertion that momentarily disrupts the rhythmic flow and idiomatic naturalness.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally polished with high density and evocative imagery ("motives twitching in the open"). However, the forced insertion of the prompt word "vivify" into dialogue results in awkward phrasing that briefly disrupts the otherwise smooth rhythm. The combat descriptions are sharp and active.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong density and propulsion. However, a few stock metaphors ("bruised moon," "wound in the earth," "sigh like damp wood") slightly dull the otherwise sharp imagery, preventing a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, though the density of similes ("like a sighing furnace," "like mismatched violins," "like limescale," "like a tuning fork") borders on overwriting. Reducing the frequency of "like/as" constructions would sharpen the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery ("lanterns remembering they were glass") that avoids cliché. The prose rhythm supports the dreamlike yet urgent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("carrying failure like another cracked vial"), but the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory. The integration of the required idiom ("penny drops") causes a jarring tonal anachronism and a tense friction ("was... drops") that disrupts the immersive fantasy register.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("swelled like a silver lantern," "ghost of distant applause"). The rhythm supports the mystical-technical tone well. A few metaphors (like "wrinkles into the air") are risky but land successfully within the genre context.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile ("like wet moonlight," "like a nest," "like a distant flute," "like coins," "like thin sheets"). This repetitive syntactic scaffold distracts from the imagery and distances the reader; cutting these scaffolds would significantly sharpen the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory imagery ("swelling like a held breath"). The "template cadence" of dialogue attribution is minimal. The density of metaphor is high but suits the genre; the line-level craft successfully supports the story's dream logic without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("skin shivering with equations," "tidal flowers"), showing high-level craft. The specific phrasing "balancedly curious" is slightly clunky and reads as an adverbial stumble in an otherwise polished text. Rhythm and sentence variety effectively mirror the shift from rigid maps to fluid geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, but suffers from repetitive diction ("persistently curious," "persistent tick," "mist-clad," "mist smeared," "mist-wrapped"). While the imagery is strong, the density of adjectives and the echoing of root words across short distances create a slight drag on the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose quality is high, with strong, evocative imagery ("Rock was honest; steel remembered collapse," "vomited ancient binders"). Sentences have good rhythm and propulsion, and the text is free of distracting loops or scaffold artifacts, maintaining density and clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and density is high; phrases like "trembling typo" and "observatory's ribs" do double duty for character and setting. There are minor moments of slightly heightened melodrama ("shapes that made my throat close"), but the technical metaphors ("failed reconstruction algorithms") ground the emotion effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("pale lightning frozen in stone"), but the specific attribute "quietly articulate" is repeated verbatim three times, creating a noticeable repetitive artifact that feels forced. Aside from this loop, the line-level craft is polished, with verbs and sensory details doing heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though the reliance on simile constructions ("like patient hornets," "like a pendulum," "like a joke," "loud as breaking ice") creates a repetitive syntactic cadence that slightly drags on the rhythm. Information density is high, but the "like/as" frequency borders on artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacting appears in somewhat precious phrasings ("light as memory and twice as insistent") and mixed metaphorical logic ("gears groaned like tired constellations"), but the rhythm generally supports the escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but marred by repetitive diction artifacts ("bruised cobalt" in para 1, "clouds bruised" in para 3; "cobalt" twice in para 1). While the rhythm is good, the density of figurative language occasionally slows momentum, and the echo of specific adjectives detracts from the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphor density ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "folding time") that occasionally slows momentum. Several prompt phrases are repeated verbatim ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "quietly persistent") within a short space, creating noticeable lexical loops.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lyrical and dense, with strong imagery like "lines spreading like coral," though it occasionally leans on "writerly" stock phrases ("dusk bled into violet," "sensible shoes"). Rhythm and flow are excellent, supporting the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and image-rich ("rocks... shifted with slow colors like breathing gills"), with strong rhythmic control. While a few phrases lean toward the precious ("hush of improbable beginnings"), the imagery generally works hard to advance the story's logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-caliber and dense, though the repetition of "bruise/bruised" (sky) and "pin" (star) within a short space detracts slightly. The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "hush of cosmic possibility" borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density and strong rhythmic control drive the narrative forward. A few moments of dense alliteration ("shadows slicing the surface into shards of trembling night") border on purple prose, but the overall execution is polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is high with strong imagery ("echoes hesitate," "folding over themselves like ink in water"). The writing is polished, though occasionally leans on slightly familiar metaphors ("smiled like a drawn blade"). The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, carrying the weight of the backstory without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative with high image density, though it occasionally leans into "purple" territory with heavy metaphor stacks ("spring blossoms rained backward"). The rhythm is well-managed, but the sheer volume of figurative language in the climax slightly slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose contains beautiful imagery, the execution is marred by significant repetition of distinctive phrases ("interlaced hush," "accumulates silence," and "exhume" each appear three times in a short space), creating a lexical loop that feels artificial. Additionally, the integration of "across sharing a secret" results in strained, non-idiomatic grammar ("keep it only across sharing a secret") that breaks flow.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "millimeter widen into a road" and "ghosted with saints." The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing, accelerating appropriately during the video description without losing clarity. There are no visible scaffold artifacts or loop patterns; the line-level craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical and high-density, with excellent rhythm and metaphorical cohesion. The "glass lungs" metaphor is a standout peak beat, though the opening paragraph leans on familiar tropes before the unique imagery takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished but relies on several stock metaphors ("tighten like a drawn bow," "tangled in shy knots," "trembling breath"). While the imagery of the "flower press" and "copper dust" is fresh, these clichés flatten the emotional peaks and reduce the distinctiveness of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Imagery like "sunlit daggers" and "breath a ghost ahead of her" serves the atmosphere efficiently while advancing the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with strong imagery ("swallowed shout," "pencil and breath"), though it occasionally nears overwriting with dense metaphorical stacking. Line-level momentum is maintained, and the technical language is integrated well into the lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and free of scaffold artifacts or loops. Images like "clarity as sharp as turpentine" and "stillness pressed against the shelves... like held breath" demonstrate high-level craft. The rhythm accelerates appropriately with the countdown, supporting the scene's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the imagery is strong, the prose relies heavily on a "noun verb like noun" simile scaffold (>8 instances: "like animated ink," "like loose rigging," "like stamps"). This repetitive syntactical pattern dulls the immediacy of the otherwise high-density prose.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density; nearly every noun is paired with a figurative modifier ("breath felt borrowed," "sky tasting of night," "silence layered like dust"). This constant poeticizing creates a "haze" that slows momentum and obscures the mechanical reality of the scene. The rhythm becomes monotonous in its relentless lyrical softness.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-functioning imagery ("discarded vertebrae," "brambled hope") that advances the narrative. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with the tension, and there are no visible artifacts or scaffolding that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose suffers from the repetition of unique metaphorical phrases ("pane of hush" and "beautifully flawed" both appear twice), which draws attention to the writing as an artifact. Additionally, the high density of abstract similes ("like questions nested within regret," "like a skipped heartbeat before a necessary lie") creates a figurative muddle that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in almost every line ("iron wings clicked and folded," "rust freckled their brass feathers"). Phrasing like "hungry as low tide" and "bleeding hope" works within the heightened atmospheric context, though the latter leans slightly conventional. The rhythm supports the melancholic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("listening to the water argue," "chorus of entanglement"). However, the density of figurative language occasionally stifles the narrative momentum, with nearly every physical observation turning immediately into a metaphor. While technically proficient, the constant poeticizing softens the reality of the lab and the river.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is polished and evocative, it suffers from a high density of similes ("like fragile bells," "like thin ice," "like unshelved books," "like seeds," "like an invisible index") that creates a repetitive syntactic scaffold. This reliance on "X like Y" constructions occasionally stalls momentum, prioritizing ornamentation over direct action in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally evocative ("adobe ribs darkened and sighing"), but the verbatim repetition of the phrase "sturdy brittle" acts as a distracting artifact. The phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" reads as slightly expository, disrupting the otherwise poetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the imagery is often inventive ("bins into bells"), the prose suffers from awkward adjectival phrasing ("vigorously tender," "empathetically decisive") that tells rather than shows. These visible artifacts and a reliance on dense metaphor over active verbs drag down the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Images like "notes crumbling like chalk" and "silver ivy" anchor the abstract concepts in visceral sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density is high with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("unmoored punctuation"). A few metaphors tilt toward abstraction ("thinner than thought"), and the required phrasing creates minor drag, but the line-level craft generally sustains the dreamlike momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    The opening line contains a glaring tautology ("tiptoes on its toes"), and the prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb starts: "Lio rises," "Lio is," "Lio cups," "Lio answers"). Frequent use of filter verbs ("He feels," "He sees," "He realizes") dilutes the immediacy of the sensory details. The rhythm becomes monotonous due to a lack of syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic ("long slow sentence spoken underwater"), with high information density and no scaffold drag. The line-level craft effectively supports the atmospheric tension, and the final image of the stone ("future had pressed its thumb") is stylistically superb.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative with high information density. Phrasing like "fading to cotton" and "cobbled together with theatrical sincerity" is strong. A slight reliance on abstract summary during the epiphany ("He realized... that the path to empathy was...") prevents a top-tier score, but the execution remains excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and density. However, there is a tendency toward decorative metaphors ("violet that tasted of iron," "creak like old throats") that occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("steered by fingertips... by wind... by the tug"). Imagery is specific and active ("moss erupted in a heartbeat"), avoiding scaffold, though the filter "He realized" in the climax distances the reader slightly at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density and evocative, with phrasing like "negotiators with the concrete" and "numbers clustering like anxious birds" adding texture without slowing momentum. The technical terms are used naturally to build authority, and the sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the investigative pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and rich with imagery ("veined like trapped thunderclouds," "wings fixed like notes"), though it occasionally leans into label-speak ("synesthetically blessed"). There are minor filter verbs ("He knew," "He imagined") that distance the reader during the buildup, but the rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("commas in a sentence" is a standout metaphor). The required phrase "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice, which feels slightly repetitive for such a distinct adverb, but it is integrated grammatically.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("catching the dark like a question half-asked"). Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "soft, devastating finality," but the overall rhythm and precision are publication-ready. The text avoids scaffold and maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative ("bruised plum"), but the simile "like carbonated water" strikes an anachronistic note that jars against the "relics and paper prayers" aesthetic. Additionally, the repetition of "germinate" and "wonder" in the final third feels slightly unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with standout phrasing like "salt and patience" and "furniture seemed to clear its throat." A few metaphors feel slightly overworked (e.g., "sponges left beneath thunderstorms"), but the line-level control generally supports the magical realist tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally metaphor-heavy ("stubborn question," "hush of time's unraveling"). The rhythm supports the weaving motif, but a few adjectives clutter the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("baskets stiffened into mineral husks"), with strong rhythm. The repetition of "azure defiance" works as a structural device. Minor exposition ("Scholars said...") is functional but less vivid than the immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and image-rich ("peeled... like old skin," "dense star"). Information density is high, though the reliance on consecutive similes in the high-pressure climax ("like atmospheres," "like misaligned gears") approaches overwriting without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high, with arresting imagery like the boat steered "like an apology" and the beam feeling like a "missing rib." The prose avoids scaffolding, delivering density and momentum. A few phrasings lean slightly toward the sentimental ("luminescent ache"), but the strong physical grounding keeps the text firmly in the literary band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and imagery-rich, maintaining momentum through heavy descriptions like the "reclaimed silicon" wick. Sentence variety is strong, utilizing the "hum" motif to control rhythm, though a few descriptions bordering on the technical ("total internal reflection") are dense.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from extreme density of figurative language. Almost every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("like mica," "like seashells," "like balloons," "like listeners," "like riverwater"), which stifles momentum and draws attention to the writing itself. The constant "as if" constructions create a filter that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("sounded hollow, like a seashell"), with strong rhythm and imagery. A few moments of explanatory telling ("Milo suddenly understood," "It was not dramatic") slightly flatten the immediacy of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphorical density ("bracelets of fractures," "last lung," "sleeping embers") that slows propulsion and obscures causality in the peak beat. While the rhythm is good, the reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a decorative texture that borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but prone to overwriting and abstract metaphor ("clink swallowed by an enlarged tranquility," "letters small as apology"). While readable, the reliance on adjective-heavy description and slight clichés ("syllables dry in his mouth") dampens the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally high, with evocative imagery like "braided into the cold air" and "fragrant ruin." The score is held back by the aforementioned register clashes (e.g., "heuristically gentle") which feel like lexical artifacts rather than organic voice choices. The prose rhythm is otherwise strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("shimmer convulsed like a startled eye"). The line-level craft supports the story's "hush" without sacrificing momentum. No significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythm ("teeth that remembered every bite"). While the metaphorical load is heavy ("voice like rope," "sounds felt padded"), it remains consistent with the established voice and does not obscure the causality of the climax. No scaffold loops or synonym churn detected.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong line-level craft with evocative phrasing ("gravity with an accent," "sunlight that kept breaking into evening"). The prose is dense and polished, successfully balancing the surreal imagery with narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from a significant text artifact: the repetition of the unique phrase "auroral sorrow" in the middle and very last sentence creates a loop. Additionally, the phrase "mnemonically gifted" is inserted awkwardly as a modifier rather than woven organically into the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("words slid under his ribs"). There are minor instances of telling rather than showing ("guilt... haunted every council meeting"), but the rhythm and sentence variety are generally excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically distinct ("Wind pushed an arm of copper..."), with high information density and strong sensory verbs. A rare slip into slightly clichéd metaphor ("rearranged the furniture of the heart") is the only blemish in an otherwise tightly crafted, purposeful texture.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Imagery is evocative and density is high, with strong sensory details like "error messages scrolling like prayer flags." However, the repetition of the "He [verb]" sentence structure creates a slight syntactic monotony, and the triple use of the phrase "strangely organic" reads as a repetitive artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from occasional overwriting and metaphor clashes (e.g., "spilled like open veins" implies violence in a sheltered scene). Some imagery leans on standard workshop tropes (shutters yawning, mouths gaping), but the general density is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with standout images like "ink feathered into fractal shorelines" and dice "hunting a new orbit." However, mixed metaphors in close proximity—specifically water "reading Braille" then "tasting me"—create sensory confusion that briefly disrupts clarity. While the lyrical style is a strength, a few phrases (e.g., "mysterious familiarity") lean toward decorative abstraction rather than concrete precision.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with no visible scaffolding or loops. Imagery is fresh and functional ("taper kissed a wick," "stunned fish"), and the rhythmic control supports the building tension. The circular framing of the "gleaming silence" adds a layer of structural elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally modifier-heavy ("terrestrially cosmic," "paper thin as dried river mist"). The density of imagery is high and generally effective, creating a strong atmospheric texture without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A few metaphors border on precious (e.g., meteors as "punctuation marks"), but the overall control is high. The visual precision of the climax—the seal's symbols rearranging—demonstrates strong line-level craft without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and vivid, but suffers from usage errors in the final stretch ("peoples'" instead of "people's," and a tense clash with "fades" vs "rose"). These slips in the closing paragraph mar an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally elegant and high-density ("bled like confession"). However, the phrasing "stalactites drip marked the minutes" and "stalactites drip counting his steps" creates a jarring grammatical stumble, reading like a forced insertion of a noun phrase rather than organic description. This repeated artifact disrupts an otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is evocative with strong sensory anchoring ("flute of bone," "listening like stone"). However, prompt insertions cause friction—"progressive disclosure" reads like technical manual text, and "webs of intrigue" is a worn cliché that clashes with the fresh imagery of the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains significant flaws, including a stuttering opening sentence ("carved a candle-lit shrine carved"), a grammar error ("glaciers northern face"), and a jarring loop where the phrase "weaves truth carefully" is repeated almost verbatim in adjacent paragraphs. While individual images are striking, these unforced errors in a short piece severely impact polish.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is often striking ("fog thick as boiled milk," "tongue of drips and sighs"). The score is capped by the repetition of clunky prompt phrases ("scintillatingly somber" appears twice), which reads as a forced artifact rather than intentional style.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold, with high information density in every line. Images like "scattering rainbows into a crushed, fractured halo" and "dust storms scratched the sky" serve the atmosphere without clogging the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from high adjectival density (e.g., "trembling silver," "swollen sky," "rain-fat atmosphere" all in close proximity). While the imagery is strong, the reliance on metaphor-heavy descriptors occasionally slows momentum and draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene. A few "as if" constructions could be tightened for greater immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("listening the way tides listen to moons"). However, the writing occasionally slips into preciousness, and the awkward insertion of prompt-mandated adverbs creates minor stumbles in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is evocative but suffers from a distinct repetition artifact: "fleshly constellations" is immediately followed by "fleshly ethereal" in the next sentence, breaking immersion. Some imagery leans toward purple ("bruised light," "smeared itself"), but the technical descriptions of sound are sharp and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by occasional clichés ("impatience gnawed at my ribs") and scaffolding phrases ("Images rose behind my eyes"). Some descriptions are abstract ("softly purposeful") where concrete imagery would sharpen the characterization. The line-level craft is solid but lacks the freshness of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and strong imagery ("air itself seemed bruised"). A few phrases lean toward melodrama, and the final paragraph summarizes the emotional resolution ("apology that echoed without sound") rather than letting the concrete action of writing the report carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, though occasionally it teeters on the edge of becoming ornate ("tired little dignity"). The line-level craft supports the "vibrant hush" of the setting well, maintaining momentum despite the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose density is excellent with strong information conveyance and vivid imagery. The score is held back slightly by a visible cliché ("faith that eats caution for breakfast"), which disrupts the otherwise fresh linguistic texture. The rhythm and syntax generally propel the action well.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("black square of time," "threadbare orbit"). There is a slight tendency toward preciousness in metaphors like "braided the clue," but the rhythm is generally excellent. The integration of required phrases is smooth, avoiding the awkwardness often seen in constraint-based writing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric ("lanterns swinging like low moons"). The mandatory phrases are integrated smoothly, though the adjective density ("shadow-laced," "calmly intuitive") is slightly high in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery like "motor coughing like a long-time smoker." There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("fragile, anticipatory texture," "low, practical voices") that occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft remains polished and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with evocative imagery ("suitcase tipped open like a mouth mid-sentence"). However, the prose suffers from telling-heavy phrasing inserted to meet prompt requirements ("passionate subtlety," "drawing parallels"), which reads as artificial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the imagery is strong, the prose suffers from rigid "tiling" of specific prompt phrases ("kinetic parapet," "conjured clearings," "strangely honest") which appear verbatim multiple times. These lexical loops create a mechanical rhythm that disrupts the otherwise fluid style, signaling a checklist approach rather than organic weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of "like/as" similes (chimneys like fingers, photos like petals, Myra like a fox, words like washers, machines like whales). This frequent scaffold creates a repetitive cadence that distances the reader from the immediacy of the images.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and evocative ("bruised blue," "burning the joints"), establishing a strong rhythm. The score is held back only by a slightly high density of similes ("like a toy," "like stolen sweets," "like an old coat") which, while high-quality, crowd the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from occasional overwriting ("unshed tides") and a significant repetition artifact in the line "tide sucked at the stones with tidal longing." These slips in an otherwise high-density text mark it as needing editorial polish before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("trembling like teeth in an old jaw"). The line-level craft supports the tension without becoming purple, maintaining momentum through the technical descriptions. The repetition of "changelessly constant" is noticeable but functions as a rhythmic anchor for the character's mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but marred by lexical repetition ("radiant" x2, "small" x4 within the short text) and some dense metaphorical stacking. The phrase "shattered could still shine" verges on cliché, and the persistent lyricism occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Imagery is specific and functional, avoiding ornamental clutter while maintaining a rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally exquisite ("tendons realign like rearranged sentences"), but the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "shrewdly innocent" for two different nouns (contraptions, then the boy) creates a visible artifact. This specific redundancy breaks immersion in an otherwise polished text.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high adjective density and some awkward prompt integrations ("reflectively vibrant" is a jarringly technical modifier; "zephyr bloom" reads as a mixed metaphor). The rhythm is hypnotic but monotonous, lacking variation to signal shifts in intensity. No major technical errors, but the style is overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and often evocative, but suffers from awkwardly integrated prompt phrases (e.g., the long noun phrase "a pattern left by drip of...") and abstract telling ("protected vulnerability") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is high-density and rhythmic, but the climax suffers from sentimental abstraction ("teaching her to build galaxies... instead of apologies") that reduces the line-level impact. Some phrasing ("feral nexus," "braided") feels slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high adjectival density and occasional overwriting ("furred with moss," "hush gather like cloth"). While mechanically clean, the style leans on decorative metaphors that slow momentum without adding necessary information or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing strong imagery ("ribs," "dew on a forgotten atlas") to build texture. A few metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("joints seemed to grind time itself into powder"), but the overall line-level craft supports the story's gravity well.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density and occasional purple phrasing ("coiled like a question," "wounded bird"). While the imagery is often vivid, the reliance on simile to describe mechanical states occasionally clutters the clarity of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density and evocative ("gravel in marrow," "trembling shards"), with strong rhythmic control. The required phrase "boundary-lessly trapped" is clunky by nature but is integrated as a philosophical paradox, minimizing its disruption to the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and dense, with high information load and strong rhythmic control. The repetition of the prompt phrase "rain-beaded skylight" (three times) functions as a refrain, though the specific phrasing is slightly cumbersome; however, it anchors the setting effectively. The imagery is fresh, avoiding cliché even when dealing with rain and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Imagery like "wings ticking" and "gray hesitation" builds a cohesive aesthetic. The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is high-quality, lyrical, and dense with imagery ("quivering whenever the desert wind remembered them"). Sentence rhythm varies well, and the mechanical descriptions are elevated by the metaphorical lens without becoming confusing. A very strong technical execution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally elegant and high-density, though the mandatory phrase "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" creates a slight syntactic stumble in the opening paragraph where the sentence structure becomes overloaded. Despite this minor integration friction, the line-level craft remains strong, with vivid imagery and no distracting artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally evocative but suffers from precision errors and overwriting. The "ticking" sundial (a non-mechanical object described with a clock's verb) creates a distracting logic break in a story about rejecting clocks. Abstract metaphors like "smelled of lost decisions" and the synonym loop on "thoughtfully clear" lower the technical score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant text artifacts damage the prose; the specific phrases "golden dock under snow," "oceanic hush," and "fog rolls" act as repetitive loops. Additionally, the insertion of "fog rolls" creates a jarring tense shift (present) within a past-tense narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("bare as a stripped altar"). The carpet metaphor is woven through the text skillfully. The line "projecting presence alone" is a minor artifact of abstraction that tells rather than shows, but otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense with evocative imagery ("piston blossoms," "wistful code"), creating a strong textural experience. Information density is high, and the rhythm generally supports the action, though the cluster of similes during the courier scene ("like a blown bulb," "like a mechanical fault") slightly impedes momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is polished and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from a high density of simile-scaffolding ("like a dancer," "like nails," "like an unblinking eye," "like a held breath," "like a tide," "like a flare"). This template cadence distracts from the action and draws attention to the authorial hand. While the imagery is evocative, the structural repetition weakens the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rich in imagery ("constellations learning to walk"), with strong rhythmic control. A few specific phrases recur unnecessarily ("defiant hush," "stained glass box"), and the integration of the required phrase "realistically imaginative" is slightly clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is high-density and rhythmically strong, with evocative imagery ("radiance approximates infinity," "shed their layers like old regrets"). However, the verbatim repetition of multiple prompt phrases ("troubling serenity," "approximates infinity") creates a slight mechanical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("unfurled wings along the margin"), but occasionally dips into overwrought phrasing like "thundering calm" or wordy constructions ("fog that should not have been possible"). The rhythm is steady and supports the meditative pacing, though the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the imagery is strong, the integration of required phrases creates significant paraphrase loops (e.g., "tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle" immediately follows a description of those same "grooves"). These text artifacts disrupt the prose rhythm and density.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and image-dense, often achieving striking beauty ("ink through watered silk"). However, the density of figurative language is high, occasionally bordering on purple (e.g., the cluster of "cobalt candle," "unwinking eyes," and "gong" in close proximity), which slightly slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("thin as breath on ice"), but the required phrase "groundedly imaginative" creates a register clumsiness with its awkward adverb. The term "predictive modeling" also clashes slightly with the "quill and vellum" aesthetic, creating a minor tonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is evocative and high-density ("spines of interference," "stubborn as cinders"), creating a strong textural experience. The bookending use of "thistled calm" provides a satisfying rhythmic container for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("murmurs congeal," "stuck to her like soot"), fitting the artistic setting. The figurative density is high, bordering on purple in moments, but it successfully constructs the necessary atmosphere without collapsing into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("stopped screaming... only gurgled," "leaning like broken teeth"), with high information density. Minor reliance on filter verbs ("I took that as," "I felt like") slightly distances the reader, but the imagery remains sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("softened the echo of his steps"), creating a strong textural experience appropriate for the genre. A few images verge on the precious or slightly abstract ("breath between pages"), but the density and flow remain high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery ("rasped in the wind like an old lung"). The line-level craft is high, though the specific insertion of "synaptic plasticity" creates a jarring tonal artifact in an otherwise atmospheric passage. The sentence structure varies effectively to control pacing during the pruning sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and evocative similes like "words falling like coins in a steel tray." The prose maintains strong rhythm and propulsion, avoiding empty scaffolding even during the transition to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("swallowed by the plaster"). However, the repetition of the specific phrase "inadvertently profound" (once for diagrams, once for the house's intent) feels mechanically forced by the prompt, creating a slight rhythm bump in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally prone to stacking modifiers ("foxglove-stained glass ampoule"). The repetition of the phrase "animate lifeless" feels like a forced insertion rather than organic description, but the overall rhythm remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and high information density. Images like the "crack chased itself" and dice "favoring no number, just the act of falling" are excellent. The only minor stumble is the required phrase "balancedly daring," which acts as a clunky adverb-adjective stack that briefly disrupts the otherwise smooth textural quality of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and lyrical, with strong imagery ("catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices"). However, the reliance on simile construction ("like a clogged lung," "like vines," "like a seed," "like a shared breath," "like rain") becomes repetitive, creating a syntactic scaffold that distances the reader from direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose quality is high, with dense imagery ("posture of a ballerina and the vocabulary of a footnote") that serves characterization. The simile "dough bright as riverweed" is striking. The writing is polished and efficient, avoiding loop artifacts or scaffold, maintaining momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("jutted from the earth like a molar in a rotting jaw"). Imagery is precise and purposeful, though occasionally verges on slightly ornamental ("neatly inventive") without adding strictly necessary detail.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "badly developed photographs," though it occasionally leans into heavy modification ("unmistakably dead," "damp fingertip"). The integration of the required phrase "unbosom" is handled smoothly within the context of the archaic book. Rhythm remains propulsive despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery like "clenched fists slowly opening" and "trembling map of possible futures." The line-level craft effectively translates abstract concepts (resonance, fractals) into concrete sensory experiences. A few filter verbs ("she sensed," "she felt") appear, but they are generally purposeful in establishing her unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("sun pressed down like a hand"). A jarring tense shift occurs in the phrase "after the gate rusts shut," likely a forced integration of the prompt, which disrupts the otherwise stable past-tense narration. Aside from this artifact, the line-level craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally evocative, but marred by a jarring tense shift in the opening ("slipped" vs. "drops") caused by rigid prompt insertion. The verbatim repetition of the phrase "emotionally rational" creates a noticeable stylistic stall.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few phrases lean toward the abstract ("interlaced absence," "absence layered within absence"), but the concrete imagery ("swallowing the note so gently") largely balances this. No mechanical artifacts or loops disrupted the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from filter verb usage and some "tell-heavy" phrasing ("She loved the stamp because it told the truth"). These artifacts dull the immediacy of the investigation, though the rhythm and imagery remain generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is vivid and polished, though the density of "like" similes ("like uncut paper," "like a blade," "like a second, burning moon," "like a flower") becomes repetitious syntactically. The imagery is strong, but varying the comparative structures would improve the rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, which effectively establishes the "bleak exhilaration" tone, though the opening paragraph nears saturation. The writing clears into sharp, active syntax during the climax, demonstrating excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the rhythm is generally smooth, the prose suffers from "writerly" affectations and clichés like "questions in eyes" and "metal clicking like a punctuation mark." The opening line's "brilliant dimness" is a confused image that muddies the start.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the prose is polished, a persistent simile loop creates a distracting rhythmic artifact. The construction "like a [noun]" appears approximately eight times ("like accusations," "like a tooth," "like a sentence," "like a pulse," "like a bone"), creating a predictable scaffold that dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is weakened significantly by the verbatim repetition of three distinctive phrases ("furrowed hush," "recycle mistakes into wisdom," "apology and forgiveness") within a short word count. These loops act as jarring artifacts that disrupt immersion and suggest a checklist-driven approach to craft rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high figurative density that occasionally stalls momentum ("enthusiasm could waterproof regret," "silence eventually formed a grid"). While many images land ("gulls stitched ragged circles"), the frequency of metaphor in the opening beats draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The "text-artifact" of over-curated lines slightly distances the reader from the raw regret.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative without stalling momentum. Metaphors are fresh ("hardened popcorn like a fossil in amber") and serve the narrative logic. The line-level craft supports the high-concept imagery seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm and density are strong, though the prose occasionally leans on stock phrasing ("secrets older than rain," "unseen hands") or abstraction ("woven galaxies") that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp imagery. The dense adjective-noun pairings border on overwriting but suit the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, with high points like "veined like polished stone." However, some phrasing leans into melodrama or pathetic fallacy ("clouds... waiting for a penitent," "sob that hurt like swallowing glass"), which detracts from the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, lyrical, and dense with imagery ("confession too heavy to speak"). While occasionally verging on purple ("seductions of violence"), the rhythm and word choice are generally masterful and suit the story's elegiac mode perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished and high-density, but the repetition of the word "hush" (three uses of "whispering hush" and one "vibrant hush") becomes a noticeable artifact that dulls the lexical freshness. The reliance on the "would" construction in the climax distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("chipped edge spun like a frightened compass," "chains sighed"). The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final sentence is an exceptional example of conceptual repricing through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control ("collapsed star dust rose without rising"). However, a few metaphors tilt toward the abstract or purple ("aurora hung lower than fear," "borrowed dawn of courage"), slightly obscuring the emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is dense with imagery, occasionally slipping into overwriting with mixed metaphors ("handwriting," "bruise," "isobars"). The distinct repetition of "furiously tranquil" within a short word count triggers a penalty for unpolished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, though the verbatim repetition of the clunky prompt phrase ("danish tin sewing needle card") disrupts the flow. Occasional lines border on purple ("dignified as a question mark drawn in ink"), but the visual imagery is largely sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, though occasionally verges on purple ("contraband birds," "luminous fracture walking"). There is a minor repetition artifact with the word "contraband" appearing in close proximity in the first two paragraphs, but the line-level propulsion generally holds up well.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive but suffers from simile stacking ("arched like a rib," "rolled like distant trains," "groaned like a cello," "laughed... like a chord"). This repetitive "verb-like-noun" structure creates a mechanical cadence that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is high, with imagery that advances the plot (e.g., "wrinkles look like riverbeds"). Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with the building tension. A slight over-reliance on simile ("like glass," "like charms," "like riverbeds," "like metal") is the only minor drag on an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information-dense lines (“water had risen past the third-floor observatory, swallowing her simulations…”) advance both backstory and emotional stakes without scaffold. Metaphors stay internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“catastrophic punctuation marks”) fits an astrophysicist’s mind yet stays within POV lexicon. One minor paraphrase loop on “dust” mentions in closing paragraph, not enough to dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphors are disciplined—vehicles stay inside glass/charcoal/frost realm; no mixed vehicles. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths ebb and flow like breath. One scaffold loop: “learning to…/I called it…” repeats concept but adds nuance each time, forgiven. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, resonant, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences carry sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“fires bloomed like poppies among buildings, yet even the flames forgot how to roar”). Metaphors are consistent (sound vs light) and physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler stacks. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; final line crystallizes civic hope. Minor repetitions of “silent/silence” are pattern-driven, not artifact; they teach the Quiet. Register remains within Lio’s artist-tuner lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “the sea opened like an eye” does triple metaphorical work without purple stretch. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language peaks at the descent but never muddles causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “permanent address.” Only hairline slip: slight over-alliteration in “shivered rainbows,” but it passes read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are selective, never stacked; each image advances either fog-density or lantern-pressure. No synonym loops; “lantern” recurs with shifting modifiers (tiny figure, small sun, unspent orbit) that reweight meaning. Opening line anchors voice and stake simultaneously. One mixed metaphor—“boundary lines were thin here”—is minor and forgiven in payoff torrent. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; sentence openings rotate between participle, noun-phrase, and verb-first. Mixed metaphors are intentionally dream-logic but internally coherent (“water refuses reflection and instead opens like a pupil”). One paraphrase loop (“quaking reverie” used twice in closing paragraph) but the reverb feels ceremonial rather than sloppy. High information density—each sentence layers sensory, temporal, and symbolic work—without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “ticket stubs like molted scales” does double sensory + world decay work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay physically coherent—circuit-board feathers, sunburned veneer. One strained phrase: “countdown she had no clock for” edges toward abstraction but is saved by sonic echo. Closure line—“she spoke softly, guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace”—lands clean, no purple.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, technical, and emotional data without scaffold. Metaphors disciplined to synesthetic logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “hull split by…” lines but does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density is high—single sentences split light, theft, and moral disbelief. No synonym loops; “sun caught their cheek” and “striping our faces gold and shadows” use distinct verbs for visual precision. Mixed-metaphor guardrails respected: moonbeams behave like liquid silver but never contradict prior optic rules. Rhythm accelerates into the shutter-crack clause, then exhales into the cool moon walk-home, matching emotional cadence. Zero line-level artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long frost-images, staccato drip-sentences during pour. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—ice as breath, glass as memory—without muddle. One scaffold risk: “dramatically narrating mundane tasks” is repeated, but pattern is taught early and justifies voice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: one sentence does three jobs—e.g., “plastic sealed like organs in jars” fuses setting, metaphor, POV bias. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor is single, coherent, paid off. Peak beat—“I would walk into the production office shaking”—is plain diction, no purple override. Read-aloud ear varies cadence; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose carries oral rhythm—variation in sentence openers, purposeful enjambment, no template cadence—while information density remains high: one sentence often delivers sensory detail, emotional tilt, and world rule. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; “marbled hush,” “ambered hush” reuse is pattern-taught and paid off. Minor scaffold appears only in the echo of “nothing left to…” twice in quick succession, but the second instance is reframed by the oracle’s reply, so momentum sustains. Closure beat is free of figurative muddle, letting the final line resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or cognition. Metaphors are precise and physically coherent (“icicles hung…like organ pipes”). Information density is high: one sentence can stage, sense, and philosophize (“the procedure they had wheeled his chassis…”). No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs anchor even abstract perception. Rhythm accelerates with loop compression, then breathes when tone releases aerial view—perfectly calibrated to emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist still braided with the lamps” fuses sensory layers in one verb. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent—arrows as sutures, tickets as talismans—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Occasional Latinate elevation (“resonant hush,” “communal field”) is justified by the registrar’s archival diction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, tool, and emotional filter. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and precise. Occasional elevated register—“temporal manifold”—is justified by Rae’s dialogue and does not leak into Ilen’s interior.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: “paper sagging, ink already bleeding into shapeless clouds” does triple work—sets, stakes, symbol. Figurative language is patterned (water-as-riptide, chandeliers-as-chimes) and never muddled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “like distant, uneasy chimes” and “like a pale, swollen leaf” are both simile clusters within 20 lines, but they serve distinct sensory slots, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language sparse and precise—“rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry”—never clots the fever-beat. Information density high; each line advances memory, weather, or stake. One participle opener flagged but temporal order remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric density flirts with purple but stays purposeful; metaphor stacks (“river… slow ribbon of mirrored stone”) accrete texture without muddling causality. Occasional template cadence—“He… then…” appears twice—minor loop, not at closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line offers charged image. Proofing is clean; no mixed metaphors or synonym churn. High information density: each sentence layers archive, city, keeper psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: single sentences layer scent, light, and social choreography. Metaphors are sparse, never mixed; “oxygen tubing like a halo” is precise, one-and-done. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold repetition. Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences swell toward totality, then fragmentary utterances during hush. Copy-clean; pronoun tracking flawless even with seven patients in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, concept: “Pages curled like autumn leaves, ink blurred into small storms.” One paraphrase loop (“wall…remembered…remembered…remembered”) is purposeful anaphora, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift; even “displaced axis” keeps physics consistent. Momentum breathes with paragraph length variation, never stalls in description.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, vivid specificity—“bricks salted and pitted,” “lens groaned like an old musician.” Figurative language is sparse, taught early, and paid off. Final line achieves Charged Poise without overwriting. Minor filter verb (“I realized then”) is earned and does not dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm mimics loop pedal—repetition of “loop,” “lattice,” “claim” teaches pattern, then pays off when demon snags on mirrored claim. No mixed metaphors; ultramarine line is clean physical act. One paraphrase loop: “empty…full of things we do not want to name” could compress, but it occurs mid-homiletic beat where expansion is tactical. Final line “slipped free” is crisp, propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence layers image, sound, and concept without scaffold. Metaphors interlock (spiral = ruler = tunnel = zipper) creating internal rhyme rather than clutter. No loops, no synonym churn, no register drift. Rhythm modulates from languid reflection to staccato inventory of fortunes, accelerating toward dawn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges every prior motif.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is dense: “water beaded… refused to remember the rain” does image + world-rule in one stroke. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. One mixed-metor risk—“shattering” vs “glass”—is minor and doesn’t cloud causality. Momentum never stalls; every paragraph advances either maze logic or bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy clauses to clipped drum fragments. Information density high: one sentence carries skin, trunk, heart metaphor without clogging. No synonym loops; “drums” repeats but each time with new modifier (“sleeping heart,” “rocked,” “sighed”). Mixed metaphor risk in “filament of hush” is justified by its material use. Minor scaffold: “like some wounded beetle” could trim, but it occurs early, not near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “fountains turned to smears of copper and glass” fuses sensory image with emotional tint. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Opening line anchors voice and concept in one stroke. Two minor mixed metaphors—“quiet courtyard held its breath” and “sky turned” could clash, but the POV’s synesthetic habit justifies them. Closure line is clean, rhythmic, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light as writing, tears as stars—paid off in closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One paraphrase loop (“lanterns trembling...lanterns dimmed”) is minor and does not touch the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies; metaphors are selective, not stacked. One paraphrase loop: “texture of time” repeated without new sensory twist. No mixed vehicles, no filter-verb clusters. Final paragraph keeps propulsion; closing line lands by image, not explanation. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—shell, cathedral, applause—each recharged at closure. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. One scaffold risk: “unfinished” recurs eight times; because it is the thematic piston, the repetition reads intentional rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: “light from fossilized resin seeped through the stone ribs overhead, staining every face with a syrupy, honeyed sorrow” embeds setting, atmosphere, and emotional filter in one sweep. no paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the counterfeit motif without contradiction. rhythm modulates: languid opening clauses give way to staccato sensory bursts as empathy floods in. closure line “scaffolds to climb toward a clearer, kinder vantage” lands clean, no mixed metaphor, recharging entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform dual work: “He opened it out of habit, expecting invoices, and instead found...” advances plot and reveals trait. No paraphrase loops; figurative language is sparse and tied to maritime lexicon. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. One minor scaffold: “the hour after the symphony ends” is repeated almost verbatim; −0.2 but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence runs. Information density high: single sentences layer sensory data, emotional valence, and world rule. Figurative language controlled; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Minor filter-verb cluster (“I realized,” “I understood”) in climactic beat costs −0.2. No paraphrase loops, no typographic errors. Final line snaps shut by image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: one sentence fuses grief, geometry, and orchard respiration—“equations where hope and fear dovetail into spirals neither growing nor shrinking, only circling.” No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-use and biodegradable. Rhythm modulates from incantatory lists to clipped final acceptance. One mixed metaphor—”table steady” after “mismatched pieces”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“tape… cling like cobweb”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“juddered,” “exhaled”) carry motion. One negligible filter verb cluster (“he heard… he saw”) is voice-motivated and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information density is ferocious—single sentences deliver weather, parental absence, and occupational routine without slack. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph’s breathless anaphora (“roots curling… stems straightening… cracked pot…”) that propels the collapse. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; “thunder grumbled like a tired animal” is fresh yet apt. Only the faintest scaffold: “she told herself” appears twice, a micro-tic that keeps this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—sentences perform double duty: “clouds hung low, gravid with more promises than rain” fuses metaphor, mood, and world logic. Varied rhythm; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Fresh figurative choices (“thought she could almost think before exhaustion smudged it away”) avoid purple. Minor lapse: “the idea…landed in her chest with the weight of intention” is a touch familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “dust leap like startled insects” does double sensory duty. Rhythm modulates from hushed opening to the final heartbeat sentence without template cadence. No paraphrase loops; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. A single mixed metaphor—“chord… sharpened by teeth”—is vivid enough to pass, but cleaner physical logic would secure 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentences carry double duty: “starlight that should not have reached the narrow alleyways” simultaneously sets atmosphere and signals cosmic wrongness. Metaphors are spare, never mixed: “columns rose like patient giants” fits the station scale. Final line anchors closure with image alone—no explanation, only the felt cost of “trembling certainty.”

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line craft is dense and musical: “waves folded and unfolded,” “starlight… vibrated the mortar,” each image doing atmospheric and tactile work simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge, image, or beat. Metaphors stay coherent—whales as tuning fork—without crowding the peak beat. The final paragraph achieves cadence release without overwriting, letting the gray light and dim tile carry the emotional exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-impeccable: each sentence advances image or stakes (“Even for a bored immortal, that was new”). Metaphors stay internally consistent—light as serpents, space as mutinous hull. Minor density spike mid-storm (“crowns of bent nails,” “frantic constellations”) but pattern-taught and purposeful. Zero loops, clean tense, paragraphs cuttable only at cost of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stolen public funds slid quietly into private coffers” does three jobs in eight words. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is limited to two controlled metaphors that echo the theme. Sentence rhythm varies from short scalpel cuts to longer liquefied cascades. Final line cadence lands cleanly, recharging “last trick breathes on” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers new information or texture. Metaphors are disciplined—“leaves catching the first gray hints of dawn” performs simultaneous color, scale, and fragility. Rhythm breathes with task: caesuras when pen pauses, accelerando during hum-deepening. No figurative muddle in the closure beat; final ripple is literal ink-line and conceptual abyss.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are lean and physical—“containers… frozen waves,” “tide inhaled dark water”—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can layer time, sensory skew, and world-rule (“a missing line of numbers in a database”). Final line cadence slows to match the deliberate surrender to blankness, ear-tested aloud for tidal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust floated in patient spirals” does scene-setting + mood + metaphor in five words. No synonym loops; each return of “hum” accrues new semantic weight. Mixed-metaphor check: “story nearly over yet stubbornly unfinished” is intentional self-contradiction, not slippage. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph would break knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—world-building plus emotional tilt: “noise and neon tides” compresses carnival + exhaustion. Occasional scaffold: “I thought, naively…” tells us an irony we already see. Mixed trope “foundation stone chip hung warm as if remembering” is borderline sentimental but brief. Otherwise clean propulsion; no loops or register drift in closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no synonym loops or scaffold sentences. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“mist clung… like breath that refused to fade” sets tone then yields to concrete action. Sentence variety supports momentum: front-loaded participles only when simultaneous action is plausible. One mixed metaphor risk (“braid with the distant horns and gulls”) but cadence carries it without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences carry double duty: “ice accepted my weight with a complaining crackle, but held” simultaneously propels, senses, and foreshadows. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (iron lake, fallen feathers, dry stare) is used once and left to resonate. Syntax modulates from languid dock sentences to drum-beat steps across the ice, echoing the internal crescendo. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors that could be lifted out as proof of structural polish.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “dust hung where voices used to gesture” collapses sight and sound into one line. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is selective, never clustered in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors are avoided—fork as shut eye, bell as rusted vowel, all consistent with sound-as-memory logic. Final line “the work of revival finally began” is plain, letting the image resonate rather than overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory information or metaphor without paraphrase loops. Figurative language avoids purple excess by staying tethered to POV physics—"water glittered with drifting particulate like dust motes in a sunbeam" maintains plausible underwater optics. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor filter verb clusters ("I felt") forgiven because embodied emotion requires them. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses yield to stark final sentence that lands closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length mirrors tidal surge. Information dense: one sentence often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent (tower as throat, pages as will-o-the-wisps). Minor scaffold: “torn throats and torn trust” is near-chiasmus but serves sonic pattern; no paraphrase loops. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Closing paragraph cadence slows to match elegiac acceptance. Copy clean; pronoun reference clear despite complex clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: metaphor clusters serve mesmeric pattern without muddle; rhythm breathes with emotional crests. Minor paraphrase echo (“winter-cracked fields” twice) but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; long sentences carry the climb, then fractured fragments (“Dust falls like flour”) mimic the awl’s tap. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise. The only minor slip is “hauntingly optimistic slowness”—an adverbial lift that momentarily sounds editorial rather than felt, but it occurs early and is quickly grounded in the physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density: single sentences fuse action + metaphor (“apple trunks…cursive prayers”). Occasional soft paraphrase (“journey… severed line”) loops earlier phrasing but does not stall climax; sensory nouns strong, scaffold minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: one sentence folds job, philosophy, and stakes (“licensed to invent lives that letters could wear”). Metaphors stay coherent (glass ribs, bleached coin) without mixed vehicle. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Minor templated cadence in “Each name hovered…” trio, but it serves accumulative beat and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “power moved not in straight lines but through adjacent possibilities” entwines concept and metaphor without drift. Varied sentence openings; no scaffold loops. Only hairline slip: “conspiracies unraveled and rewove themselves” is near paraphrase of earlier re-weave image, but cadence just distinct enough under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to the staccato “I was afraid.” Information density is high: one sentence often layers metaphor, action, and world-rule (“phosphorescent algae painted every trunk with breathing green wounds that healed in moonlight”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each metaphor is fresh yet physically coherent. The final line’s hush between wave-slaps is a deliberate decrescendo that recharges the cradle-song motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: every sentence advances either the surgical countdown or Mara’s ethical slide. Metaphors are precise—“coral turned shrapnel by politics” fuses geology and geopolitics without strain. Only one mixed image (“lotus-hearted ache”) momentarily jars, but it is earned by the boy’s anesthetic haze. No scaffold, loops, or simultaneity errors; high-information lines (“She pressed it into my palm without meeting my eyes”) do triple duty: action, status shift, moral baton pass.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—metaphors of film, lungs, chandeliers—each serving beat’s emotional temperature. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere, backstory, and tactic. One mixed metaphor (“knowledge network of color”) is minor; no artifacts near closure. Meets 9+ quick test; prose propels without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“Beneath sixty years of grime, figures slept inside figures, a whole city of nested awakenings” = time, visual, theme). No scaffold loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “epistemology” in commentary—stays within narrator’s reflective capacity. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm breathes with the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm clicks like beetle exoskeletons; sentence lengths vary to mimic wing-beat cadence. Two adjacent “like” similes (“like bottled moons / like impatient typewriters”) verge on pattern overload but serve sonic world-building. Zero scaffold, high lexical specificity—no synonym churn. Closure image is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings, high information density; metaphors stay physically coherent. One scaffold trace—“shyly unstoppable” repeated exactly—feels thematic, not accidental, but drifts close to template cadence. No mixed metaphors or register drift; nouns precise. Opening and closing lines carry punch. Minor paraphrase loop in “blossom armistice” explanation could compress, but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or choice. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent (“slow white river” of clouds, “dust of names”). High-density lines carry triple duty: “exhaling the dust of names” = bodily act, archival act, spiritual sacrifice. No scaffold; even abstract nouns are anchored to breath or glass. Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: single sentences perform scene, metaphor, and interior turn (“I dipped my pen, and as the nib broke the surface, the room stirred, attentive as a jury”). Metaphors are coherent—ink well as patient eye, vow as braided wire—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Proofing clean. Only micro-loop: “silence” used three times in close succession, but each instance gains new semantic weight; forgivable. Closure beat crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with the volcano metaphor; sentence length modulates from short cracks to looping chain-lines. One paraphrase loop—“the building breathes” twice in 30 words—drops a hair-line 0.2. No mixed metaphors; “encrypted compassion” is the single abstract ridge yet is anchored to the chain’s iron. Information density is high: every sentence maps, measures, or voices conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies from lung-full catalogues of sense to clipped denials (“I wrote many songs…”). Figurative language is dense but patterned—dust = staves, city = score—taught early and paid off at closure. No scaffold loops; each line advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“unspooling life”) is marginally outside Noel’s likely lexion but reads as lyrical magnification rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly compressed, most sentences doing double duty (image + causality), with strong read-aloud cadence and varied openings. Mixed-metaphor risk is present (“sunlight… sheets,” “clouds… hexagons”) but coheres inside the prism conceit; no vehicles violate internal physics. Occasional near-loop—“distances folding and unfolding inside green walls”—is offset by new information. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“peeling,” “tilted,” “shimmered”) drive motion. One paraphrase loop: “fractured hush” thrice; yet its repetition becomes incantatory, pattern-earned. Copy is clean; no typos. Final line cadence lands with resonant throb. Artifacts do not obscure closure; density stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job-double duty—e.g., “banks of lights along the dome flickered like tired stars” advances setting, stakes, and simile. Metaphors stay coherent within underwater optics (glass, stars, tide). One mixed vehicle—“knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned”—barely grazes closure. Opening line anchors voice and final line resolves by image (“gentle pulses, teaching me how to belong by listening”) without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music varies from crystalline clauses to surf-like enjambment; no scaffold or mixed metaphors. High density achieved via nouns that do double duty (“footprints tattooed”), propelling momentum without cluttering the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: tidal clauses swell, then clipped coin beats. Information density high—one sentence often sets scene, reveals tactic, signals metaphor. No loops or scaffold. Only minor purple haze: “seashell pressed to the cosmos” could lose “pressed” without loss. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is sonically controlled—sibilance mirrors hush, fricatives mimic surf—“phosphorescent hush” is worth the price of admission. Information density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors setting, escalates stakes, textures body). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; moon-tugged sand never fights glass roots. A single scaffold phrase—“the gaps I have studied” vs “gaps yawn open tonight”—could be compressed, keeping the score just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with the mist—long anaphoric clauses that slow time, then a terse final demand. Metaphors are precise (fracture lines = shoreline) and never stall propulsion. Minor scaffold: “the way…” repeats twice in adjacent sentences; barely touches the closure, so only a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves high density: single sentences deliver backstory, object history, and sensory hook (“pressed against my ribs...fragile second heart”). No synonym churn; “scarred hand / cracked box / cracked eye” forms deliberate fracture motif. Metaphor chain stays coherent—moon as watchful cracked eye mirrors porcelain—without overwriting. Rhythm breathes between memory and present, accelerating only at confession beat to match vocal scrape.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to staccato observations; no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (tide, braid, needle) and do not collide inside high-pressure beats. Sentences routinely carry double duty—e.g., “I felt a flash of grief…steadied me” advances emotion and stakes. No scaffolding, no mixed metaphors; clarity at closure remains pristine. A single intensifier cluster “serene upheaval…held breath between worlds” is purposefully patterned, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “I set my recorder on the floor, closed my eyes, and hummed” does three jobs in fourteen words. One paraphrase loop—“legacy’s burden pressed down… this was legacy’s burden”—clips an otherwise flawless run; the repetition is minor but audible. Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic logic; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    High figurative density is patterned early and paid off; minor loop risk in “mirror / silver / light” clusters but cadence breathes with scene rises; no mixed metaphors, strong verbs anchor each sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“artillery muttered like old gods”—never clogging high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one line can anchor setting, metaphor, and emotional state. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “philanthropy as misdirection, generosity as alibi” compresses motive, PR, and sin in eight syllables. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror → hand → cartography—without mixed-vehicle accidents. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new physical or moral information. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” academicism—is absorbed inside the financier’s lexicon and therefore motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information density is high: one sentence often does triple duty—image, metaphor, causal cue (“lanterns burned with a blue so soft it seemed dangerous”). Mixed-metaphor risk is flirted but never violated; vehicles stay within optic/breath/sound family. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor scaffolding: “they called her Iri, for…” reads as necessary legend, not exposition dump. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary from participial to clausal without falling into template. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. One paraphrase loop (“stories stain…patterns the stain reveals”) is forgiven because it functions as refrain. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence mirrors wind—alternating luxuriant coils with clipped prepositional shards. Metaphors stay coherent (green lantern, paper fire) and payoff in final image. Information density high: one sentence can anchor place, reveal backstory, and foreshadow moth-wing reuse. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; only hairline slip—“skywide silence” verges on oxymoron but reads as intentional compression.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and mythic registers—“tempo tuned to the turning of names.” Metaphors stay coherent under glacial physics; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates naturally between frost-hush and bronze-ring. Minor filter-verb clusters (“I imagined pouring absence”) but never in peak beats; final image line is clean. No loops, synonym churn, or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water forced itself through old seams, trickling down like the first curious scouts of an invading army” performs setting, stakes, and metaphor in one breath. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances either sensor data or interior tilt. Mixed metaphors are purposeful—static whispers, glitching voice—mirroring system failure. Rhythm modulates from lullaby dream cadence to staccato alerts without losing clarity, and the final clause “he steps into the present” lands monosyllabic, a metrical release.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“beams rose like invisible columns…converting the courtyard into a three-dimensional abacus”). No scaffold loops; metaphors consistent (abacus, chapel, grid). Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”—is narrator’s own taxonomy, justified. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is selective; when it clusters (“walls bent outward and inward, trading places with the air”) it serves the reality-shift beat rather than ornamental display. No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive: “ice filmed every blackened branch” twins touch and sight in five words. Metaphors are coherent—glass mountains, frozen sea—never mixed; physical logic intact. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as he inhaled / as he exhaled” clauses create template cadence, but repetition is pattern-taught and serves breathing ritual, hence waived. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stake. Final paragraph lands with imagistic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long lyrical accumulations crash into staccato cuts (“I refused, tore the contract”). No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (contract risk = moss, soft until pulled). One template cadence appears—three consecutive “I…”—in the vow paragraph, but it mirrors incantatory intent and does not obscure causality. Information density high: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, and world rule (“spells shuddered, turning the orchard feral”).

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose shows high density: single sentences perform world-build, sensory cue, and metaphor (“apples were miniature suns; from others, closed eyes”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; rhythm accelerates into mirror paragraph without scaffold. Figurative logic consistent—fruit-pages thin as pistachio skins—no mixed-metaphor muddle. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he suspected”) and do not cluster in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences world-build (“shelves spiraled up tunnels, crossed stone bridges”) while advancing movement. Figurative language is selective—“unheard symphony,” “paper-cut eyes”—and never clutters the final beat. Rhythm accelerates into the circular chamber then slows for the one-page choice, creating cadence shift. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence either maps, reveals, or costs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line “adding a rescue mission to the shelves” recharges leaf-vein motif.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences often twin image and motion (“rust running backward like water”). No loops or scaffold beyond one near-repeat of “burning.” Metaphors stay coherent (mirrors = corridors of face). Strong verbs anchor every beat. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing”—is earned by narrator’s professional lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor strings (“high nest of shadow and tick and breath”) are deliberate and paid off in closure image. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Opening line anchors stakes and surreal premise cleanly; final line carries physical object out as new ethical burden. Occasional elevated Latinate nouns (“escapement,” “ceremonial”) fit specialist POV and do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early—“hammered repose,” “anvil of everything”—so lyric excess reads intentional rather than accidental overwrite. One scaffold tic: repeated “slow spiral” (three hits) could compress to two. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no mixed vehicles; closure line is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; every sentence layers job—image, backstory, forward pressure: “glass humming pavilion had grown around the ancient lighthouse like a salt flower” marries setting, decay, and organic creep in one breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent: lattice, thistle, net, beam. Opening line anchors voice and collapse; final line resolves by image that recharges “thistle-blown hope.” Read-aloud rhythm breathes with comet’s roar and shard’s thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is selective, not stacked: “lightning pulsed like silent heartbeats” serves inversion theme. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor risk—“sediment of sky”—but physical logic holds. High information density; each line advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense, no loops, metaphors mutually coherent (tide-marks, groundwater, shoreline sand). Rhythm breathes with the pause itself—long sentences slow, then break at “Let us go.” Minor purple fleck: “mirrors of water in the stone” is twice used, softening the final shine.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses during float, staccato beats at re-entry. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, world data without scaffolding. Figurative runs are purposeful and patterned early (“gilded hush,” “orchard of unsounded thoughts”), not overwriting. One paraphrase loop (“silence…hush…quiet”) is minor, not touching closure. Copy is clean; no simultaneity errors, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; sentence rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in final third, both clean (“bridge made of gentled breaths”). No synonym loops or scaffold; each line advances image or pressure. One micro-slip: “star-colored shards” is lovely but slightly vague; a sharper sensory noun would top the band. Otherwise ear-test passes aloud without stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops, high-density lines (“kaleidoscopic waterfall roared, each droplet refracting archived advertisements”) advance three jobs at once. Metaphors are coherent (OS-steps whisper startup chimes) and peak beat remains clear; sentence rhythm accelerates with ascent, no scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates from long, river-like sentences outside to staccato inhale at close. Figurative language is dense but patterned—bridges, shores, rivers, thresholds—paid off in final re-casting. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances stakes or air. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “congealing into something with teeth” does noun-to-verb lift and stakes world rule in six words. No scaffold loops; each metaphor (submerged stars, barometric storms) adds new physical logic rather than restates. Sentence variety avoids drumbeat; fragments reserved for peak beats. Minor mixed metaphor risk—“letters crawling back in at wrong angles”—but forgiven because glitch concept licenses it and closure clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors acoustic build: short tactile clauses early, then longer wave-like sentences as hum thickens. No loops or filler; “dust hung like mute constellations” does double sensory job. Figurative language stays physics-true (standing waves, crest of possibility) yet emotionally legible. The final image—“ring placed on wood”—is bare, letting sound carry weight, no metaphor overload in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations then abrupt monosyllables (“I will stay”). Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, pressure). No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; “glass apples hummed softly” keeps vehicle consistent. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “came” in noble list, but beat is brief and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and varied; sentences open with concrete noun or prepositional phrase, avoiding template cadence. One scaffold slip—“later love had disappeared too, dissolved in arguments”—is mild paraphrase but does not recur. Metaphors are precise: “tired lung” for fluorescent room, “dandelions in a parking lot” for rare praise. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings; information-dense lines (“copying the forgotten into a format that could survive another erasure”). Two mixed-metaphor risks—“soft gold shimmer, as if the pavement remembered a sunken star” and “jazz smuggled into a military march”—slightly dull peak beat, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often layers time, sensory input, and metaphor—“the lake was a sheet of uninked paper waiting for his notes to scratch their slow handwriting across it.” No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the sonic conceit without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm rises and falls like breath through the horn. Only hairline slip: “vested hush” is slightly opaque on first appearance, but the context teaches the phrase immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: waterfall roar demands long sentences, greenhouse quiet allows clipped fragments. Information density is high—one sentence often fuses sensory data, backstory hint, and emotional tilt (“Veils of spray hung…scattering lantern-light into trembling echoes”). No mixed metaphors; vertical river of glass stays physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “he had reached the age when coincidence becomes pattern” is a touch abstract, but it is the only such line and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “promises… corroded, clung, and changed the name of whoever carried their rust” does triple lexical duty. Mixed-metaphor guard passed—rust-to-ink-to-mirror sequence stays within liquid-to-solid metal logic. No synonym churn; “solder,” “unsolder,” “fuse” recur with purposeful metallurgical precision. Single scaffold detected: “names were molds” immediately followed by “molds… poured us through them,” a micro-loop that slightly dulls an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early (“trees that glowed like stained glass wounds”) and justified by interface premise; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates—long hypotactic musings collapse into short declaratives at entry to frame. One paraphrase loop: “displaced yet rooted” repeated; minor −0.2. Filter verbs minimal; “I felt” clusters acceptably under anesthesia haze.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense yet lucid; metaphors are coherent within light/refraction through-line, no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often handles atmosphere, backstory, and foreshadowing (“Between childhood and now, the market had waited…”). Two near-adjacent “as if” clauses are the only scaffold trace, too minor to ding. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty: “Dust thicker at the back than the front meant someone had visited recently” simultaneously reveals method, stakes, and time. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into the final breach—“the ceiling above us gave way with the soft, fibrous sigh of tape ripping from cardboard”—without overwriting. Minor hedge: “like someone flips a membrane instead of a switch” is the only near-cliché, but it is brief and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “equations unraveled, clocks forgot” packs three system failures into five words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances stakes or image. Mixed-metaphor guard passed—spiral/merges gracefully with grammatical sentence. Minor −0.1 for two adjectival triplets (“deliberate, grammatical elegance”; “shallow dream”) that slightly delay peak beat, but these do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    High figurative density but patterned early (“slow, iridescent curtains”) and paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates under storm pressure, then exhales into final quiet. Zero loops or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often handles spatial, tactile, and metaphoric work (“Rust crept… like petals around a wounded seed”). Rhythm modulates from percussive droplet-sentences to the held-breath clause that releases dawn. One minor paraphrase loop on “rust… rust” costs −0.2; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final line crystallizes without exposition: “the city loosen the breath it had forgotten holding.”

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Only two scaffold loops (“then he… then he…”) early in descent; otherwise rhythm varies and propels. Metaphors are lean, never stacked; information density high—“jars clink softly” does triple duty: sound, fragility, obsession. No mixed metaphors at climax. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he sees… he realizes”) in vision paragraph costs −0.2, keeps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet buoyant: “tide had thrown up a tangled altar” does three jobs in nine words. Only micro-loop: “blue line ran out of map and into blank gray sea” echoes the same idea twice; single −0.2. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “light entered at a low angle, sliding through the etched glass like water through layered rock” performs metaphorical work without mixed vehicles. Only one adjacent paraphrase (“dawning hush” echo) appears; it does not touch the closure beat. Information multiplexing is high—each sentence advances image, character perception, and causal logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Clean copy, precise punctuation, and strong paragraph cuts that would alter charge if removed.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “moonlight could not pierce its surface; it seemed to drink the sky” does three jobs—sensorial, metaphorical, foreshadowing. Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato fragments under retrocognitive slam. One paraphrase loop—“truths buried deep enough to seem endless” echoes “no bottom, just layers…”—but occurs early and does not recur at closure. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent to lagoon-as-absence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene: gravel-whisper, fruit-lanterns, wax spiral mirror thematic spiral. Figurative density high but patterned and paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; “fruit like muted lanterns” stays consistent. Minor scaffold: “softening every edge into suggestion” could trim, not fatal. Read-aloud ear test passes; opening and closing lines frame stakes and reverb cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is compressed and rhythmic; sentence variety avoids monotony. Figurative language is high but patterned—cold, spiral, tidal—teaching the vortex motif early. No mixed metaphors; “wild serenity” is intentionally oxymoronic. One template cadence—“I came… I answered… I thought”—is repeated only once and serves as ritual framing, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, no scaffold; every sentence at least doubles duty (image + causality or theme). Figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent—wind “combed through his hair” fits meteorologist POV. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges listening motif. Read-aloud ear test passes—rhythm breathes with pressure peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm: cadence rises/falls with revelation, no template drumbeat. High density—each sentence layers metaphor AND advances image. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor scaffold: “dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae” could trim one modifier, but doesn’t obscure closure. Clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, varied sentence openings. Figurative language is sparse and apian—never purple. High information density: “soldering saints and suns into a small reliquary of color” does triple world/character/religious duty. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “glass” references could fuse, but this does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only a faint echo of “glow / glowing” repeats without strain. Metaphors are coherent—concrete breathing, algae of ages—and do not collide. Information density is high: one sentence slips notebook failure, olfactory rain, and the turn to town-as-calendar. Rhythm breathes with pressure, accelerating toward the final palm-on-glass moment. A single over-modified phrase “distant mile markers seen through storm glass” slightly clots the image, keeping the score just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences carry double duty (image + interior shift). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“loom forever throwing shuttles between broken colors”—slightly muddles the weaving image, but it resolves on re-read. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “tree trunks of frozen moonlight” compresses geology and luminescence in five words. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each image advances either circuitry logic or bodily erosion. Rhythm accelerates with copper spirals, then exhales when panels slide open—sentence length mirrors pulse. Copy-clean; opening and final lines serve as volta and ground wire, respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple, sentence openings varied, no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, metaphorical, and thematic work (“bronze quiet: the color of old telescopes…”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within metallurgical/rain lexicon. Scaffolding almost absent—only “I realized” could be trimmed, but it cues the reader to the equation insight. No loops, no synonym churn. Copy-clean except one em-dash splice, which is voice-motivated. Final line ends on monosyllabic stress that matches the withheld thunder, reinforcing closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; high density—each sentence layers seed, war, language extinction. Metaphors are coherent: “flat gray tomb” for dead reef, “small ghosts” for horse breath; no mixed vehicles. Varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Final line’s “ragged chorus” is rhythmic payoff to earlier “braided calls.” Proofing clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences layer scent, color, sound without crowding. One mixed metaphor—“horizon bled orange behind mountains of scrap”—is momentary, not closure-touching. No template cadence or synonym loops. Opening and closing lines carry acoustic echo, satisfying read-aloud test. Minor overwrite in “rusted constellation” phrase keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm tracks content: dilation is enacted via deliberate cadence repetition (“lagged a heartbeat,” “fractionally delayed”) that never loops into scaffold. Metaphors (folded paper distance, closing eyelid shadow) extend rather than contradict physical logic; each image is anchored to viewport or starfield. Information density is high—one line can layer dust-taste, machine whisper, and memory flash without padding. No artifact intrudes on closure; the final palm-on-glass lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “stormlight curled in colors that had no names” does three jobs—sensorial, world-establishing, and metaphoric—in seven words. No loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances stakes or image. One mixed metaphor (“wind died as if decapitated”) is earned by voice and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm is deliberate and read-aloud viable; sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual cadence that mirrors walking circuits. Figurative language is selectively layered—no stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats—so “draft that slipped like a nomadic penumbra” remains singular and clarifying. One minor scaffold: “a kind of luminous absence that hung between strangers” could lose “a kind of,” but the slack is localized and does not touch the closure beat. Information density is high; each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or stake.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythmic control is exemplary; sentence lengths swell and contract with the protagonist’s breath. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as “pulse-warm,” glass as “ghosted friction.” No scaffold loops; each image advances either atmosphere or causality. Minor density surge in the lantern/page paragraph but it pays off by teaching the world rule that air itself “reads,” justifying later linguistic infiltration.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm flexes from long atmospheric opener to staccato tugs and bell-tremor beats; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—tower like “captured lightning bolt”—and stay physically true. Information density high: one sentence slips in exile cause, prince death, guilt weave without summarizing the climax. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors; opening “held breath” returns as earned final exhale when rain resumes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, clauses sliding like bone joints. Metaphors are lean and precise—“forged hush,” “cracked throat”—never crowding. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stakes or image. Minor mixed metaphor “price paid in ignorance” forgiven because it is voiced by Zev and matches his elliptical idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; sentence openings diversify. Metaphors are purposeful and non-contradictory: “acid pressed like a hungry cosmos” sustains physical logic. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; each line advances knowledge or pressure. High information density: “vats of smoking emerald acid gurgled below the slats, and the smell etched cauterized paths through his thoughts” does triple sensory, world, and interior work. Only hairline slip: “ quilts memories together” verges on poetic abstraction, but immediately grounded by tactile tracing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line density is high yet transparent: one sentence often paints, smells, and foreshadows (“Patterns gathered…like the spirals of a thousand unpainted seashells”). No filler, no scaffold loops; paragraph cuts would delete knowledge. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—mirror, shell, wave reverberate—so density never clots. Occasional adjective pairs (“salt-stained,” “saltwater light”) are purposeful tonal varnish, not modifier bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“mist slipped…like breath easing from a feverish chest”—and pay off in the cooled-stone payoff. Information density high: “the old cork sighing as if relieved from duty” does three jobs (sound, personification, backstory). No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density—lines perform double duty: “cables droop like tired veins” paints setting and foreshadows system death. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than repeats. Zero scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“geometry of loss,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within Rian’s chart-maker lexicon. Final line cadence—“where it can soften”—gives quiet exhale without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense packing, zero paraphrase loops, varied sentence openings, muscular verbs (“chewed,” “bit,” “sheared”). One metaphor cluster around “ligaments / nervous / dreaming animal” arrives within a single beat and is pattern-taught, so allowed. The final paragraph’s short declaratives mirror the eye’s clearing, propelling closure. A lone simultaneity hiccup—“I woke with the taste of iron in my mouth and the feeling of having watched…”—drops the tenth of a point.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Almost every sentence carries double duty: sensory punch + conceptual map (“wet planks throwing back colors no one had painted there”). Metaphors are coherent—mist as living membrane, lighthouse windows as cataracts—and map onto memory’s haze and blindness. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles. Clause variety and paragraph cut-test pass; removing any paragraph would erase a knowledge tilt or sensory cue. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final pin, then snaps to stillness; line-level craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “petals…exhaling pale pollen that glimmered in shafts of borrowed sunlight” seeds atmosphere, signals rising water, and foreshadows dissolution of boundaries. Metaphors stay coherent (paper-turning sound for stone) and avoid stacked overload. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances. One pronoun slip (“they” for ants after “ants” gap) is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Varied sentence rhythm carries ascent breathlessness; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—sky as wound, crown as ornament—without purple overload. High information density: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentence slips time, vocation, and metaphor—“ember nexus at twilight, titles melt.” Metaphors stay thermally coherent; no mixed vehicle accidents. Occasional lyrical stack (“iron halos that catch the last light in trembling filaments”) but pattern taught early, paid off in shell halo. Minor scaffold: “like” simile reliance; does not impede closure. Pronouns clean, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences dual-load atmosphere and exposition. Figurative layering is high but patterned early ("frozen lightning," "feral nostalgia") so it reads as voice, not clutter. One scaffold echo—"I call it…" / "I am here alone…"—mildly loops; otherwise zero paraphrase cycles or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “robes pooled like ink” does triple duty—visual, status, foreshadowing ink function. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (steam ≠ contradictory vehicles). Rhythm modulates—long sentence for kettle arc, fragment for “Again.” Paraphrase absent; each line advances image or pressure. Tiny loop risk: “storm” repeated three times in closing paragraph, but serves looming escalation, not artifact. Read-aloud cadence supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    High metaphor density is patterned and paid off, not ornamental. Sentence rhythm accelerates from catalog to one-sentence release. No synonym loops; copper, spark, echo recur with escalating charge. Peak beat (“a small electric offering”) is clean and pivotal. Two near-clichés (“hush lay like held breath,” “called collect”) minor nicks at 9-border.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, world-rule, and interiority simultaneously—“the siren valves, teeth waiting for a key that was not yet invented.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the hydraulic conceit without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm varies from hammer-drip short lines to the final 42-word unwinding sentence. Minor flutter: “razor edges” appears three times in close proximity, but the repetition is pattern-taught and pays off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or theme. Metaphors are coherent and physics-loyal: “quiet wildfire” stays sub-audible, never erupts; mycelium “chews” waste, keeping agency biological. Syntax varies from long security-patrol sentences to the staccato of override keystrokes, mirroring heartbeat. Opening and closing lines form a charged bracket: static rinse → shared hesitation, re-pricing permeability without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences perform mood, world, and character (“The library smelled of wet wool, printer ink, and something sweetly green, like crushed clover”). Figurative language selectively deployed; no metaphor piled in high-pressure beats. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous despite multiple “he” figures. Vivid nouns and strong verbs over modifiers. Minor scaffold: “the day… the rain… the sky…” opener trio is purposeful pattern-teaching, not template churn. Closure line “scrubbed but not renewed, a little sad, clover bright” lands crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm: long sentence opens, shortens under call pressure, lengthens again into ebb. No synonym churn; “electric pause,” “concrete throat” are specific, not purple. Only micro-loop is “hum of streetlamps” echo—functional, pattern-taught. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—sea as page, footprints as commas—never mixed. Information density high: one sentence delivers ink color, tide argument, narrator oath. Minor scaffold: “barnacle roses opening into slick mouths” and “mussel shells unfolding like black tulips” stack vehicles within three lines, slightly diluting pressure. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; high information density—each sentence advances premise, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined: “politely closed parentheses,” “stalled prayers”—each image serves theme without crowding. No loops or scaffold; only one near-paraphrase (“technically not supposed to know each other” vs “statistically improbable acquaintances”) but the second line re-inflects with anarchic humor, so forgiven. Clean grammar and tense throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from liquid long beats to single-note fragments, accelerating with the note-trail. No loops, no filler filters; “languages lived in those surfaces” does triple sensory work. One mixed metaphor risk—“silence pressed like cool hands”—is saved by tactile POV consistency. Otherwise pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “patterns could absolve misdirected intentions” compresses moral and cosmic stakes. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety natural. Metaphors coherent: “anomaly hummed like a patient throat.” Final “gently, unbend” lands rhythmic payoff. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) tolerated within academic POV.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Metaphors are sparse but precise—“bowl of spilled stars” anchors the whole harbor. No synonym loops; “signed” repeats only when pattern demands. One mixed vehicle: “camera… violin sleeping” is justified by advisor’s musical premise. Information density high—each sentence advances image or emotional state. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the click land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density, zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is selective (“river of fire,” “crimes...layer of ash”) and never clouds causality; rhythm flexes with long breathless sentences and clipped fragments under lantern light; closure line is lean without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density—almost every sentence couples image with stakes advancement. Figurative language disciplined: “knot of headphone wires” is exact, not purple. One scaffold spot: “beautiful in the way distant disasters can be” abstracts a beat already shown; minor. No loops, no mixed metaphors, grammar clean. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed metaphor—“ribbon of intention curling through steel canyons”—slips in mid-rescue; it doesn’t obscure causality but prevents a 9.0. Otherwise line-level craft is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose pulses with varied rhythm; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—water, teeth, stars—taught by 25% mark and justified at closure. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed metaphors absent; bruised glass, half-spoken secret, cobalt dock cohere. One near-overwrite: “trembling constellations that clung to wet boards” pushes toward purple, but the cling is physically true and echoes emotional clinging, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “bakery c4, post office e5” compresses campaign logistics into a single clause. Mixed metaphors avoided; “forests of second thoughts” is extended, not swapped. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph’s “leaflike” reprise is crisp, propulsive, and charges closure. One minor scaffold: “unspoken words” phrase appears four times—acceptable under pattern-teach rule.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: single sentences layer labor, myth, and body—“carry crates with her hips and shoulders, letting the weight roll through.” One mixed metaphor cluster around “lattices in the sky to swallow every bullet” slightly strains physical logic but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes: long clause sets scene, then short chip-fall sentences mimic carving cadence. Information density high—one sentence often layers task, metaphor, and world rule (“spoon… sworn to stir the universe… into rebellion”). No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“brightness was regulated, measured in smiles per hour”) but serves world rule exposition and is forgiven. Metaphors stay coherent within mechanical-flower lattice; no mixed vehicles. Final line lands clean, recharging “remade hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: anaphora (“He wrote…”) accelerates, then clipped final sentence lands the exit. Figurative density high but patterned—stone-as-throat, quartz-as-rib—never muddled. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor advances stakes. Information-dense: one sentence often does setting + emotion + backstory (“He remembers… smoke rose…”). Minor filter verbs appear but serve lyric distance; no scaffolding obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is musical—"embers across the dawn," "conspirators afraid of the dark"—yet every sentence advances image or cost. No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors stay concrete and consistent (reed = sleeping insect = throat = bruise). Opening and closing lines frame and resolve by image. Minor elevated diction ("constellations," "trembling") fits lyric mode and is pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied: long anaphoric clauses build suspension, then short percussive beats match striker contacts. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No paraphrase loops; “color shivered…like water” is the only metaphor cluster in the climax and it pays off the lens motif. Minor scaffold: “the thought did not comfort her, yet it loosened something” could compress, but it does not blunt the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Density is high—“curtains of intention,” “chandelier of ghosts” compress world and metaphor in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances loom, light, or body. Figurative language is patterned early and paid off at ignition. A single mixed risk—“vacuum wind” is impossible but motivated by the spectrometer metaphor—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes: long sentence for spiral deal, fragment “Both” under pressure. High information density—“each centimeter corresponded to a card, each card to a choice, each choice to a culture”—yet no fillers. Metaphors (comets, lattice) stay consistent; no mixed vehicles. Zero loops; scaffolding removed.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density high: one sentence can deliver sense of wonder plus character insight—“atoms of nostalgia orbiting the pagoda slowed, as if his choice exerted gravity on the past itself.” No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “nostalgia” and “pattern” recur with rising weight, not filler. Metaphor stack is disciplined; no mixed vehicles. Only minor over-painting—“anguished joy” appears twice—keeps this from the top band. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences deliver world-rule (“after dreams became shareable”), sensory cue, and emotional tilt. No paraphrase loops; each line advances stakes or texture. Metaphors are coherent—clouds pale “as if brightness were poured out,” shadow “stretches toward the river stones”—and physically consistent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes choice without expositional puff. Minor alliteration clusters (“library’s sharp-eyed dusk noticer”) but reads intentional, not algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence advances guilt, object, or setting. Metaphors are coherent (tail = “question mark that had forgotten how to curl”). No synonym loops or scaffold. Final line—“Somewhere inside Liora, a matching gate unlatched”—earns its lyric lift because the hinge was planted early. A single cadence echo (“she had… she had…”) is the only artifact, too minor to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: "The coffee ring has spread, a misshapen circle like a crater seen from orbit" simultaneously advances setting, theme, and stakes. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught early (ivy whisper) and paid off in the final image; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated ("I glimpse"). Opening and closing lines are visceral hooks that re-charge each other.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: one sentence often performs three jobs (anchor, sensory, metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors (“smile sounded like a reel clicking”) are deliberate synesthesia, not slips. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts hit at perception shifts. Closure line is clean, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence carries image + pressure + mythic register without purple drift. Rhythm breathes—long breath-like clauses early, shorter exhalations at climax. Only one paraphrase loop ("falling stars traced final bright scars" is echoed in spirit a beat later) prevents 9.0. Otherwise zero loops, zero mixed metaphor, zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies tactically: short declaratives for ash wasteland, longer hypoxic clauses during spark-cupping. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new angle—geology, memory, quantum metaphor. Metaphors stay internally coherent (wave functions = silence schedule). Only minor overlap: “tracks of possibility bruising the air” and “tracks scar the air” echo but serve escalation, not redundancy. Line cut test passed—removing any paragraph would gut cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: longer cadences for wonder, staccato for the gear-slot moment. Information density high—each sentence layers metal, motion, or memory. Zero filter-verb clusters; no synonym loops. A single mixed metaphor—"world was a sweater beginning to unravel from one stolen stitch"—is vivid enough to earn its place and doesn’t recur.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts around the punch-moment for propulsion. Metaphors stay maritime-consistent and mutually reinforcing; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one sentence can layer setting, kinesthetic detail, and memory. Minor filter-verb trio (“she saw… she saw…”) in memory cascade dulls immediacy slightly but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lines are dense yet breathe: “piano bench bolt rolling across the marble floor” fuses sound, motion, and prophecy in one stroke. Metaphors (lightning learning to climb) extend the world’s physics without contradiction. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or pressure. A single register spike—“seraphically mundane”—is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, not purple, so no penalty; closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only “stacked precariously” beside “waiting for one more subtle mark” faintly repeats the concept of delicate balance. Figurative language stays coherent—ink pellets as moons, crown as seed-pod—without mixed-metaphor bleed. Information density is high: one sentence often layers celestial mechanics, archival decay, and political stakes. Rhythm modulates from incantatory listing to staccato recognition, propelling the final collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: each sentence couples sensory concrete with conceptual stakes—"autonomous buoys lose their own trajectories, drifting off planned loops as if the water has forgotten how to carry them." Metaphors are co-extensive ("station hums like a tired lung") yet internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations mirrored by single-line staccato beats. Minor paraphrase loop—"quiet than the reefs ever were...quiet now"—but forgivable at lyric pressure peak and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines double-duty (e.g., “serenity with teeth”); rhythmic variation between long breath and fragment; only micro-loop is “hum of an ancient stone circle” used twice in close proximity (paraphrase −0.2); closure beat clean of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences perform multiple jobs—image, motion, metaphor—without padding. Figurative language is patterned early (steam ladders, ghost ribs) and paid off at closure (sprout in lava). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“light stuttering like a candle caught between drafts and decisions”—slightly blurs physical logic, a hairline slip keeping it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors consistent—ocean patience as grinding teeth, stillness as pearl—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Minor elevated register (“arboretum perched”) justified by POV’s artistic eye. Final line cadence resolves with echo of “kept its own counsel,” satisfying read-aloud ear.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “threads others had knotted into fate and history” packs three abstractions into one clause without losing clarity. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent (lighthouse as scythe, cards as faces) and are not over-stacked. One near-slip: “luminescent ache” appears twice; the second use feels slightly self-conscious, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density lines carry triple duty: “ink shivered, reflecting not the tent roof but the bruised memory of the eclipse outside.” Rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop mild: “time does not slow…consciousness widens…” echoing elder, but serves thematic clarity. No artifact touches closure; final sentence propels without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long frozen clauses crash into single-word beats (“incinerate”) to mimic breath fog. Information density high—one sentence often sets atmosphere, reveals tech specs, and ups stakes. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay winter-consistent. Minor scaffold: “frozen dust/frozen rivers/frozen dark” trio could trim one instance, but repetition threads motif; −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers scent, memory, and politics; minimal scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“dust did not settle… over the glass-domed desert rose farm”) is forgiven as atmospheric hyperbole. No paraphrase loops; “engraved quiet” returns as purposeful refrain. Near-perfect copy-editing; one comma splice in “Instead, she greeted them…” could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “rail spike taken from a drowned track” packs history, metallurgy, and drowned rail-bed into five words. Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to staccato “He could demand…” without algorithmic feel. One mixed-metaphor risk—“constellations…shuffling their stars like hands fumbling through dark pockets”—but physical logic holds (stars ≈ coins/pocket). No scaffold loops; paraphrase absent. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—description plus metaphor that advances concept. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled: one sustained Orpheus/observatory orbit metaphor that pays off. Strong verbs (“swallowing,” “spikes,” “thunder”) replace modifiers. Only hairline slip: “information should set people free” edges toward aphorism, but immediately undercut by next line.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm mirrors reel-to-reel motion—long sentence intake, short splice release. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent: meteors as silent stitches, firmware as fireflies. High density: amber, voicemail, tattoo constellations collapse into final burn without overwritten stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: single sentences deliver sensory data, metaphor, and causality—“shard cool and gritty against her thumb” anchors object + physiology + next steal. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphor vehicles (oxidize, gnaw) stay coherent within corrosive motif. Final line “every stolen whisper pick a color” propels outward without overwriting. Minor near-slip: “emergent hush changed flavor” repeats noun/verb pairing but pattern is purposeful, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentence “She named the sky fractured, not shattered, so it might heal” does three jobs (re-naming act, stakes, metaphor). One scaffold trace (“step on blue, step on green, step on red”) is pattern-taught and propulsive, not looped. No figurative muddle in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and narrative work. Metaphors stay consistent (light as breath, color as sound) and avoid mixed collisions. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations for Marcel’s costumes, short clausal bursts for Lina’s synesthetic jolts. Minor filter-verb clot (“she had painted it during…”) is strategic backstory compression, not artifact; no loops, scaffold, or register drift in closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; no synonym churn. Metaphors are controlled—willowglass, traffic hum—each returns to charge closure. High density: one sentence does memory + metaphor + stake (“paths clung like cobwebs…tugging whenever he tried to rest”). A single compressed participle opener is justified by lyric mode. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, sensor-data, emotional weather—without metaphor glut; only one mixed vehicle (“ancient whale” ribs) but it doesn’t cloud closure. Propulsion clean; no loop or paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: staggered sentence lengths carry the hush, then tighten into sibilance as the echo spills. Information density is high—each button color encodes shelf geography; no scaffolding repeats. One mixed metaphor ("constellation" for dust and again for buttons) is minor enough to keep clarity intact. No loops or register drift in the closure beat; final image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Figurative language is spare and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Loop/artifact screen passes: no synonym churn, no template cadence. Opening and final lines perform double duty—anchor tone and recharge motif. Read-aloud rhythm is varied, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Metaphors (lanternlight halos, dark knuckles, blank page) stay internally consistent and physically grounded. Rhythmic variation mirrors hoof-fall and heartbeat. No overwriting even at peak beat—the serenity line is single, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid algorithmic drums. Information-dense: one line often carries sensory, metaphoric, and causal payload. Only minor scaffold: “he wondered…” and “he thought…” appear twice but spaced, not clustered in closure zone. Metaphor coherence high—light/clay/bee motifs stay mutually reinforcing. No synonym churn or register drift. Final third clean of artifacts; closure image (“cooled porcelain fragile yet enduring”) lands pristine. Micro-loop: “sharp gentleness” coined twice; forgiven because it is thematic coinage, not accidental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentence-level propulsion is exceptional—every line advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off: “masts write faint calligraphy” returns as the light itself writes on walls. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One mixed metaphor limps—“air is a quivering hush” duplicates motion and silence—but it lands early and does not touch closure. Zero typos, perfect grammar, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density lines do triple duty: “shelves drift like anchored ships through vaporous currents” sets scene, stakes, and mood. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor coherence intact. One paraphrase loop—“isolation into independence” stated twice—minor, outside closure beat; allows 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Metaphors are dense but purposeful—nest as “home strong enough to cradle breath” mirrors the temple as cradle for communal memory—no mixed vehicles break logic. Occasional template cadence (“I think… I write… I do not name…”) appears, yet it serves the spiral motif and never obscures the final mirror-image, so artifacts stay below the 9-block threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “budget meetings” compressed into “radio ink”; single sentence fuses playlist cut, angry text, studio roar. Metaphors are disciplined—no mixed vehicles—and serve character perception. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at patch toggle, then releases with “long, low swell.” Minor scaffold: “like always” + “almost polite” is faint paraphrase but does not touch closure. No filter-verb clusters or thesaurus churn.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; every sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent under spatial-mutiny logic (“folding like wounded wings”) and never mixed. Information density high: one line does world-rule, emotion, and tactile detail (“The sanctuary within was not large, yet the angles…”). No filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence mirrors descent—sentence shortens to “he descended,” accepting the key might change him first—prose becomes the staircase.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the mist rose early from the shadowed quarry in mist” fuses setting, ominous repetition, and character entrance in one breath. No scaffold lines; each clause advances image or pressure. Metaphors are internally coherent (mist = breath of beast, ribbon = question mark) and mutually reinforcing rather than stacked. Minor template cadence in “the way she… the way she…” but it echoes methodical observation, so reads intentional rather than algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with stalled fronts: longer clauses swell, then cut to single verbs (“walked away,” “tagged the entry”). No synonym loops; “sweat” returns only when it changes state (walls→mattress→skin). Information density high: one sentence can crate, crest-recognition, and historical vertigo. Figurative language is patterned (water-death metaphors) and coherent; no mixed vessels. Final line lands with tactile precision—“warmed slowly”—no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythmic control mirrors musical phrasing: long crescendo sentences build to the shard-shattering harmonic, then contract into the stunned silence pool. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor (headlights like fireflies, dust as uncommitted snow) is anchored to the fiddler’s sensory filter and never layered into purple. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. The final “soft residue of yes” is a clean, resonant cadence that recharges the opening “luminous disbelief.”

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensorial, emotional, and backstory data without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (“rust…tired glitter,” “dusky harmony”) and physically plausible. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “long before I…long before I” repetition is purposeful ancestry echo, not artifact. Closure beat “papers looked less like money and more like apologies” is lean, luminous, unmuddled. Clean grammar; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies from long breathy sentences to短的, telescopic fragments under pressure. No scaffold or synonym loops; “shared burdens” rephrased only once with purposeful shift. Metaphors stay physically coherent—sky as black page, brightness as breathing. Minor over-writing in “vast black page waiting for someone to write on it” but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty: “frozen orchard revolved, rows of ghostly trees spiraling inward” simultaneously sets scene and stakes. Metaphors are coherent—lake “pretending to be water,” confession as “icicle no fire could unbend”—and pay off literally when ice unbends. No filter-verb stacks; props track cleanly from stage-mirror to orchard branch. Final line propels: participle “cracking” snaps the rhythmic cadence open.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: every image does double duty (setting + body, metaphor + causality). One clause drifts toward purple: “tide of borrowed tomorrows” risks stacking metaphors, but the next sentence grounds it in the shared vision’s physical toll, so momentum recovers. No loops, no scaffold, high density; final line crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and ingress, avoiding template cadence; information density high—one line often does scent, metaphor, and plot (“candles hiccuped wax down their sides”). Metaphors stay physically coherent (roots “trammeling” bones like rocks). One mixed image—“dusk of wax and stone”—abstracts slightly, −0.2. No loops or scaffold; opening and final lines are stark and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose density is high: single sentences perform scene-work, memory-trigger, and metaphoric echo—“echo valley that swallowed sound and fed it back a second later, thinner and unsure” layers geology, grief, and digital humiliation in one stroke. Figurative language is spare and pattern-taught; only one metaphor per high-pressure beat, none muddled. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary between participle, noun-phrase, and clause to control rhythm. Scaffolding absent—every sentence advances knowledge, pressure, or atmosphere. Final line lands clean with monosyllabic punch after longer clauses, creating cadence shift that signals closure without announcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long cuneiform clauses calm the camp, staccato fragments surface as air thickens. Mixed metaphors (lattice trees / luminous vines) stay coherent within arbor physics. Only hairline loop: “pattern that became winds” echoed twice inside 30 words −0.1. Information density high; every sentence at least doubles (setting + interior or metaphor + stake).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally: opening sentence sprawls, final sentence snaps into image. Metaphors are coherent—glass bones, marble stacks, moonlight thickening—none contradict prior physics. One paraphrase loop mid-text (“wandering… migrate… trade perches”) but momentum recovers. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world data.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—mirrored facets, latent radiance, crown of light—forming one sustained conceit. Information density is high: “canned food or guns” in the same breath as “abandoned hopes” performs world and theme work simultaneously. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the cavern’s hush, climaxing in the single-sentence confession that pulses the pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse setting, backstory, and emotional charge (“accordion slumped on top like a drunk”). No paraphrase loops; each mention of tape/scales adds new angle. Metaphors are coherent—no mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffolding; “I had come as…” efficiently situates motive. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing”—is justified by narrator’s academic self-image and occurs outside peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates with discovery vs. decision; sentences carry double duty (description + rule). One paraphrase loop (“nothing spoken may enter, and nothing written may leave” echoed immediately after) and a single mixed metaphor (“carpet of the air”) keep it from 9. Otherwise clean, vivid, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from long breathless coils to the final fragment “like a signature I refused to give,” mirroring the crack’s release. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—each metaphor (sequin stars, paper guillotine, mulberry ache) returns as charged image at closure. One near-loop—“every vine…every citrus…every weed”—reads as intentional vegetative cascade rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: one sentence slips pigment, ice, and aurora into a single brush-stroke. No loops; metaphor vehicles (“stone lantern,” “taut wire”) stay internally consistent. Opening and closing lines mirror through sonic echo—“whisper” vs. “breath returning”—creating legible pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-zero scaffold: no paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“smoke parted like foliage” sustains arboreal through-line); information density peaks in the split-second of hairpin insertion, where one sentence condenses lifetimes without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors in peak beat. High information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, causal work; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent: ripple-rings = dilution of self. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by instructor voice. Final line cadence is crisp, propulsive; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate variation of echoic anaphora (“He skimmed…He skimmed…”) followed by fragmentary after-sounds that mimic decay. High density: single sentence (“A tool, after all, was a sentence the past tried to finish…”) performs metaphor, theme, and character worldview. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances map, memory, or tone. Closure line is monosyllabic drum-kick: “he finally knew where he was”—no decorative padding.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with altitude: shorter clauses as oxygen thins. Figurative layer is spare—only two metaphors (“frozen question mark,” “old lung”)—both pay off structurally. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line is monosyllabic plunge—“He stepped into mist.” Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs (world-rule + atmosphere + character state).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences for underwater drift, tight fragments for surfacing. Zero loops or synonym churn; every image advances color-sound motif. Occasional elevated diction (“meteor hush”) is voice-motivated, not drift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths swell and contract with static pulses. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—coins as “tiny constellation of metals arguing over probability” does double duty. No template cadence or synonym loops detected. One mixed metaphor—“motion itself had been wounded and was curling around the injury”—is vivid enough to earn its license.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from long, breath-held clauses to fragmentary shards mirroring the crystals. Figurative language is controlled—metaphors (ink in water, hollow instrument) never repeat or clash. No loops or scaffold; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reverb without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero artifacts; figurative language dense yet physically coherent; final drip sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Metaphors (twilight “thin bruise,” chimneys “gray fingers”) stay coherent and physical. High information density: one sentence slips label, memory, and future duty into motion. Only minor scaffold: “the water lay in a mirrored hush” and “mirrored hush between them” is deliberate echo that recharges motif, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off—waterfall prisms return as crystal petals, flame turns liquid without mixed-vehicle crash. Sentence variety is natural; no template cadence. One scaffold risk: “like equations…like an old rival” is consecutive simile, but the second serves closure reconfiguration, hence forgiven. No artifacts touch the final image; clarity remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-driven without paraphrase loops; metaphor systems (storm, static, braid) stay internally consistent. No scaffold sentences or register drift; information dual-loads (e.g., “braided lightning scars” = ladder texture + storm history). Minor overwrought phrase “salt white wounds” is one-off and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates with each memory-clash, breathing only at the final plea. Metaphors are concrete—“fluid fizzed like soda”—and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances image or stakes. No scaffold; even the history-rewrites are shown via cities crumbling in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    High info-density: one sentence often does three jobs—anchors setting, advances plot, textures mood. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, and closure-clear. Zero loops or mixed metaphors; occasional adjective-rich peaks (“monstrous glory”) stay within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breatheable: “macerates it against stone and moisture” does two jobs (verb + tactile). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Mixed metaphor check: “bruised resonance” is brief and acoustically coherent. Register remains in groundskeeper lexicon. Final line “air holds the shape of a smile” is precise, not purple. One template cadence (“He pulls each cord in turn…”) is purposeful, taught early, so waived. Meets 9+ quick test: zero artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, no scaffold loops. One mixed-metaphor risk—“waiting sounded like every day of my life”—is rescued by specificity of reluctant-clock simile immediately after. Information density high: single line “bushes became clauses, statues punctuation” performs scene-work, character-work, and concept-work simultaneously. Minor template cadence in three successive “and” openers mid-story (−0.2); but artifact never touches closure beat, so 9-band still reachable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “heat pinning his skin” does double sensory and stakes work. Figurative language is selective—one sustained frozen-bloom metaphor taught early and revisited at closure without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either ash-level atmosphere or internal calculus. Rhythm modulates from long inhalation of arrival to the clipped “Not to the throne… not to the miters…” at the decisive beat, then exhales into the quiet departure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from declarative ascent to syncopated sensorium, mirroring signal acquisition. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends the broadcast motif. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“rehearsal curled inside the farewell”) stays within the POV’s poetic technician lexicon. Closure sentence is lean, letting the dial-tone image carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one line can set, evoke, and advance (“a low arch of rock…spectral grotto under starlight suspended where no land had ever been”). Figurative layering is controlled; only in the grotto stack do three metaphors co-exist, justified by the reality-overlay concept. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with paragraph variance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences layer job-multiplicity—each carries image, motion, and concept: “steps softened underfoot, each one swelling like a held breath” advances setting, stakes, and body in one line. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay internally coherent (thread like “inside of lightning” fits the bio-electric pulse). Filter verbs avoided; perception is direct. Minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” sounds academic for the POV but occurs in architect speech, so tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work without paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“spires like frozen sound,” “tidal flowers”) are purposeful, pattern-taught early, paid off in final rigging-of-constellations image. Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs dominate. Read-aloud ear varied; no algorithmic cadence. Line clarity survives peak lyric beats.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe from one-beat staccato to longer liquid sentences that mirror the hush. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are precise—“underwater lanterns,” “tracing-paper cry”—and consistent with the acoustic/water imagery seeded early. Opening and final lines are anchor and echo, the latter recharging “quiet” with earned moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control: opening spondaic beat (“The sea above…”) teaches cadence that recurs in softer wave-crashes. Sentences layer job-density—each advances exterior action, interior panic, and world lore simultaneously. Metaphors stay physically coherent (sea pillow, arterial cables). Minor filler: “told himself he was only here for the payday” could compress, but overall momentum never stalls; no loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: spilled ink simultaneously stains notes, forms constellation, teaches algorithm—triple duty. Rhythm breathes: long snow-descent sentences collapse into staccato code lines. Figurative control: mixed metaphors (ocean-breath, lattice-ribs) stay within physics-poet lexicon. One filter-verb cluster “I realize I have been...” forgiven as transition; no loops or scaffold in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: every sentence either advances sonic translation or deepens atmosphere; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“black throat swallowing every stray sound”) and never obscures causality. Opening and closing lines act as tuning forks for the entire piece. Minor scaffold: “quietly articulate” appears twice—acceptable as motif anchor, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or metaphor muddle; each figurative vehicle is paid off (hornets → lamps, bruise → reality tear). Information density high—one sentence often handles atmosphere, character, and causality. Rhythm accelerates into the static burst, then exhales with soil heartbeat. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, unadorned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer reflective sentences in corridor, clipped fragments at cork moment. Figurative language is patterned (bruised cobalt, storm-lick) rather than sprawl; no mixed metaphors. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory detail, political context, character motive. Minor scaffold: two “as if” clauses in close succession; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates from hush-bound monosyllables to galloping anaphora as platform accelerates; paragraph cuts track visual beats. Figurative density kept selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler scaffolding. One loop risk: “quietly persistent” appears twice; second use earns slight redundancy (−0.2). Otherwise high information density; every line advances image, emotion, or motion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with beats: long clause piles for coral-like spread, then a clipped “Here, she realized.” Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One mixed metaphor cluster—“air fold inward, like a fabric pinched... every aisle tugged”—slightly strains physical logic, but the image is brief and closure-clear. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “mist climbed the pier post by post” does triple sensory and symbolic work. Figurative language is selective; no metaphor clutter in the high-pressure cliff shoot. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected; sentence openings vary. One near-mix: “palette…did not hold paint but shards” could read as physics hiccup, yet context teaches the surreal frame early, so waived. Final sentence lands clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings rotate. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“hinge,” “lock,” “star”—so payoff justifies the lyrical stack. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“vein torn from the dark”) is justified by the hair’s color and momentary shock. Closure line is clean, no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentences for tide mirror calm, clipped fragments for each returning bead of memory. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse enough that “drowned cathedral” lands clean. High density—each sentence layers glass, stars, salt, silt—without cluttering the climb-out beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat at most—and vehicles stay internally coherent (ink-in-water shadow, drawn-blade smile). Information density is high: each line advances atmosphere, stakes, or ritual mechanics. Zero scaffolding or redundancy in the closure third, keeping the prose artifact-free and eligible for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: strong verbs (“pruning ghosts,” “shivered with light”) and selective metaphor avoid purple overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The single risky stack—“branches reaching down into my city, up into unfamiliar constellations”—earns its sweep because it pays off immediately in the seed-glow. Punctuation and tense remain stable; no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm swells and ebbs with the knotwork; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense (“light bent into patient planes,” “shadows… like curious birds”) yet each image serves atmosphere or stakes, never purple. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (anchor, mood, foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Closure line is clean, luminous, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “walnut borders around old paper worlds” does double work—craft and metaphor—with no scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Figurative control holds even at closure—“a body of stone trained over centuries to hold unspoken confessions”—without purple drift. One mixed metaphor risk: “millimeter widen into a road” is saved by prior calibration of Elias’s precision obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences often do three jobs—“Inside, instead of cargo, there was a library” advances plot, setting, theme. Mixed metaphors avoided; rib-cage → paper forest → glass lungs evolve organically. Rhythm breathes: long sentences for descent, clipped fragments inside decompression chamber. No paraphrase loops; each detail adds new angle on buoyancy. Proofing clean; pronoun “its” consistently refers to ship. Closure image unmarred by ornamental language.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught (“lightning stitched white veins”) and paid off in thunder’s applause, so no overworld penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances circuitry or stakes. Minor filter verbs (“he felt”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Final line “tinkersong wonder” is precise coinage that fuses gears and music without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with elevator ascent—long sentences climb, then fragment in cold air. Mixed metaphors (“sunlit daggers”, “sealed eyes”) remain consistent within frozen-optic motif; no clarity loss. One paraphrase loop: “affectionate detachment she hardly understood” echoed two sentences later; minor −0.2. Otherwise high density: each sentence advances goal or prism-light imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “The cable that had once tethered… dusty starlight” sets object, loss, and cosmic tone). Metaphors are selective and internally coherent—lanterns as muted pendulums, cirrus as resignation. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. Minor register lift in “spooled wholeness” quoted twice nicks perfection but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences paint time, color, emotion (“violent purple she had used after a fire”). No synonym loops; each color noun is specific and unrepeated. Metaphors consistent (sky-as-language, coin-as-map) and physically grounded. Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesuras mimic breath between horn blasts. Final line “meet each person as new light on old ground” lands clean, no cadence template. Minor elevated diction (“primed boards”) justified by artist POV.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one line often does three jobs—advance, characterize, worldbuild (“starling murmurations that stitched and unstitched the air”). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (ink, shelves, hopscotch) recur coherently. No filler loops; each paragraph cut test passes—remove any and explanatory logic frays. Rhythm varies; no template cadence detected in peak beat where corridor opens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines are dense but never congested: “each spine a frozen current of some forgotten sea” does triple sensory work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or motion. Metaphors stay internally coherent—frost, glass, driftwood, tide—forming a private lexicon. Only the phrase “soft hush of a distant morning” flirts with cliché, but it is isolated and immediately particularized by the sky “forgetting to turn the light all the way on.”

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies from auroral cadence to staccato chalk commands; no template drone. Metaphors are coherent—river of gas, vertebrae ladders—and fused to POV bias. One mixed overlap: “planetary groan” beside “tired ships” is forgiven under lyric license. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence either moves crates or tilts sky.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm is organic, with purposeful breath-length variation; no algorithmic cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned (light/time/breath) and never clutters causality. One paraphrase glitch—“nested patterns like questions nested within regret”—is a near-loop but occurs mid-text, not at closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; pronoun tracking clean in a single-character scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for maze sprawl, staccato when birds click overhead. Figurative layer is sparse, never clogs causality. No loops, no scaffold; “ghost paths forked and rejoined” does triple duty (image, rule, foreshadow). Opening and final lines echo without mechanical symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line craft is dense and propulsive; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “Below, the river braided and unbraided itself, composing a music she could almost understand”). Figurative layering is deliberate, but several metaphors stacked across one paragraph risk purple haze. Minor paraphrase loop near “divergent path” refrain; not fatal. Closing image lands cleanly, no artifact there.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the slate absorbed his chalk wordlessly, then erased itself with a faint sigh” performs failure in a single breath. No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new information (counter is invisible, bottled labels blank, branch cradles). Metaphors stay internally coherent—physical logic of glass trees, chiming aisles, and reflective apples holds. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on inventory updates that advance stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence does at least two jobs: “cold air breathed out like a long-kept secret” simultaneously sets cold threshold and foreshadows the pavilion’s hidden function. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the first image (tidal pool → miniature ocean → accusation ring) rather than repeating. Syntax breathes with action—fragments when he staggers, long clauses when grating. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves with image that recharges the “unspoken dream” motif. Zero scaffolding or near-duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “wheezing stone ribs,” “fractured harvest metaphors,” each noun/verb pair fresh yet precise. Metaphors interact—starlight is both borrowed and returned via open chutes—no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loops absent; adjacent sentences advance rather than echo. One minor scaffold: “When disagreements flared... she mediated like a conductor” could compress, but it occurs mid-scene, not in closure third, so 9-band allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Density is high—“Moonlight funneled down, bounced off rock, kissed the mirror, and plunged…” does four jobs in one line. One scaffold trace: “He saw… He saw… He saw…” triplet; functional as iterative dilation but edges toward template. No mixed metaphors; canyon/geology imagery stays coherent. Minor loop only, does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for glide, staccato for chain assessment, final calm closure. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent—chains as “calcified ink,” fog as “luminous membranes.” Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” cognate phrasing approaches academic, but localized and voice-motivated. High density—every clause layers new world-rule or sensory data—propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative muddle absent in peak beats. Sentence variety accelerates during strum, slows into final exhausted hush. High density: one sentence packs wire, bark, and social risk. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge the empathy-in-motion motif.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentence variety is purposeful—fragments under pulse, long breaths during memory.

Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “braided tight like the cords” slightly repeats earlier rope image, but does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often carries sensory data, world rule, and emotional tilt. Metaphors are coherent (sky-bow-arrow planet). Only micro-slip: “shimmering canals between roots and drifting arches” teeters on gorgeous excess, but it’s readable and motivates next move.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances investigation or atmosphere; metaphors (frozen waves, anxious birds) are coherent, non-mixed, and paid off; high density—one line can anchor space, reveal tool-use, and tilt emotion (“I clipped sensors to railings, watched strings of vapor thread away…”).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero loops, zero scaffold, high density—each sentence layers color, sound, and temperature. Metaphors are consistent (silence as weighted inhale, aurora as throat) and never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs. Minor over-indulgence in stacked color adjectives (“sapphire, emerald, rose”) but the surge is purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; every sentence advances silence or sound. Metaphors are coherent—stone folds words, flute is dragonfly-old. Information density high: silk, latch, finger-hole, honey color each do double duty as memory and tactile present. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to staccato hinge-clicks, mirroring breath before note.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences braid image, motion, and metaphor—high density, zero loops. Metaphors stay internally coherent: “grief hums beneath an ordinary day” sustains sonic motif. No scaffold; each line advances stance or image. One mixed metaphor—“drawer everyone rummaged through”—minor, not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences do dual duty (action + atmosphere); only one soft scaffold (“the sensation ran…”) and no mixed metaphors; final line crystallizes without overwriting, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences multi-task: “frost silvered the fallen apples; the puzzle grew from scattered teeth into a jagged window” advances time, sets, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops; each image fresh. Metaphors physically coherent—threads feed cardboard gaps, no mixed vehicles. Final third clean: no artifact touches closure beat. Momentum breathes but never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense, multivalent: “the planet itself seemed to be forgetting how to be soft” compresses geologic and emotional stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—floating arches braid sky, stone tries to rise—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacks (“azure defiance,” “hollow stare between understanding and confusion”) flirt with purple but serve atmospheric escalation and do not recur in climax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; opening and closing sentences anchor and echo cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence does setting, sensory bias, and theme cue (“air hummed with ozone tang that suggested engines long shut down but never quite at rest”).

No loops or synonym churn; metaphor stack disciplined—spectrum threads, probability footfalls, atmospheric hush each serve separate beats. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “black water and white foam slicing around him like shattered film” does triple sensory work without metaphor strain. Varied sentence cadence mirrors climb versus stillness; zero template patterns or synonym loops. Each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge—no scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and extinction; final line fuses shard, halo, and scraped stone into resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from tidal cadence to clipped imperative; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density is high—“transparent coil grown from reclaimed silicon and sand” does world, object, and eco-critique in one breath.

No loops, paraphrase, or filter-verb stacks; final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long frost-laden clauses for hush, staccato “graphs surged, fell, then leveled” for pulse. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed metaphor—“shimmer convulsed like a startled eye” vs. “light leaked”—is sanctioned by emotional crest. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, bookending quartz hush with sustainable pulse. Minor filter verb cluster around “He began to read” could trim but doesn’t stall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high—every sentence both advances and textures: “salt charms, teeth that remembered every bite.” Figurative control holds; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm modulates with pressure, never drifts into template cadence. Only micro-slip: “curiously steadfast calm” repeats the prompt adverb; a −0.2 nudge keeps it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work; rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Occasional stacked modifiers (“slow, luminous lines”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. Zero loops, no scaffold; grammar clean, metaphors internally consistent. Closure beat unmarred by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)

Metaphors are precise—“crystals sprout like frozen fireworks”—and never mixed; each reprises in the finale. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image or stakes. Only hairline slip: “morningless, auroral sorrow” risks self-echo, yet the cadence earns the lyric lift by that point.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He matched humidity stains like puzzle edges and followed where the blue-green inks… still hinted at direction” advances action, reveals craft patience, and maintains sensory hook. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (ribs over streets, breath on tongue) appears once and earns its keep. Register stable—no sudden academic intrusion. Final paragraph varies cadence, letting the observatory’s exhalation land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)

    Prose is near-flawless: high density—each line does two jobs (action + metaphor or sensation). No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “data-embers no larger than a pixel,” “porcelain around a bruise of color.” Grammar clean, tense stable; final sentence lands with quiet cadence that recharges the burn motif.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “steam lifting from cups into the pale air” advances both atmosphere and collective breath that will later “lean through her.” One mixed-metor slip—”open veins along the walls” beside “forgotten organ”—but the body-building motif sustains. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high without sacrificing clarity. Opening and closing lines bookend the listening motif, achieving ear-test resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence ingress, no template cadence; stacked metaphors are rationed to two per high-pressure beat, each fresh. Information density high—one line often does three jobs (“Pages had swollen… ink feathered into fractal shorelines”). Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. A lone mixed metaphor—“shadows moved with mysterious familiarity”—is borderline, but the lyric license is earned by closure payoff, so −0.2, still inside 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from lyrical spiral clauses to staccato gasps, mirroring tightening air. Metaphors remain physically coherent—light swallowed by gravity pockets, salt climbing itself. No synonym loops; each noun is specific (taper, slurry, prisms). Only hairline slip: “gleaming silence” is repeated twice; the echo is purposeful but fractionally dulls the final line’s freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless line craft: every sentence layers image and causality—“fireflies wrote brief constellations” does triple sensory, metaphoric, and foreshadowing work. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The only hairline slip is “terrestrially cosmic” appearing twice; the second feel fractionally ornamental, but the repetition is purposeful echo, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hush it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “yellow lamps should not flicker sea-green” does triple sensory/otherworldly work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is patterned—sky drafts, meteor punctuation—taught early and paid off. Minor whisper of purple in “meteors scratched quick silver questions” but fits lyric register and does not obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density: “archive for resting sorrows” compresses world-rule and metaphor in four words. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“bell of a hospital isolation ward” is precise.

    High information density: each sentence layers mythic physics (“canyon became a throat”) while advancing test-phase. Metaphors are coherent (stone=memory bank) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“voices…voices” anaphora) is purposeful choral effect, not artifact. Final line “reed-blown melancholy” re-seeds opening diction, creating closure echo—precise craft.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: single sentences braid sensory, emotional, and symbolic work ("Candles guttered...borrowed starlight"). No filter-verb clusters or loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay consistent within cold-light realm—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line lands on image that recharges borrowed starlight motif. Micro-movements (wax rivers freezing around globe) are purposeful, not puppetry. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally with paragraph-length variation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Metaphors are dense—every sentence carries figurative load—but pattern is taught early (“shadows carried small, floating lanterns”) and sustains lyric contract; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety and propulsion high; information density doubles duty (“gray, irradiated fruit” = color + peril). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Metaphor disciplined—vehicle “veil” for dust stays optical, never drifts. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges “listening” motif. Minor −0.1 for two adjective clusters (“crushed, fractured halo”) adjacent; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm swells and contracts with wind/music motifs; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: ribs-timbers, birds-notes, knot-absolution. High density—“jars slept yesterday’s footsteps” fuses object, emotion, time in eight words. Only minor filter verb (“he felt”) in closing beat, but does not obscure cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The sunset was thinning already, gold draining toward iron as if someone were dialing down the hue of the world” advances clock, color, and metaphor without stall. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figuratives are sparse enough that each lands. Opening line’s personification (“groaned like an old throat”) is earned by the sonic premise. One microscopic tautology: “thoughts shivering out of alignment” could trim “out of alignment,” but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “snowmelt… feeding the hidden conduits” does world and mood work simultaneously. Metaphors (bow neither drawn nor slack, slow lightning) are precise and non-clashing. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and syntax. A single near-purple phrase (“patient revolution turning on invisible hinges”) is earned by context. Clean copy, no artifacts in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are controlled, no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; “entangled memories” refrain recurs with accruing weight. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; information is double-loaded—“penitentiary chaplain badge still clipped to his belt, though he was off duty” advances both status and guilt. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb chains. Metaphors stay consistent to the clockwork lexicon; “confession snagging on a word” is apt and fresh. Minor near-repeat of “aptly deliberate” twice, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or stake; metaphor strings (rusted cathedral, bored god with graph paper) are patterned early and paid off, no mixed vehicles; minor scaffold in “gears-and-cogs” twice in open, but it teaches the cathedral trope and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new info or image. Metaphors are controlled—“choir forced to sing commercial jingles”—and never mixed.

    Prose is almost loop-free; only minor filter verb (“he saw”) in high-heat moment but compensated by immediate embodied follow-through. Metaphors stay internally coherent (glass = treaty = futures) and physical logic never snaps. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, metaphor, and causality—yet momentum breathes. No artifacts in the closure third; final line crystallizes without figurative muddle, satisfying 9-band line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchoring, metaphor, pressure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—sparse in high-pressure engine-start beat, richer in static listening beat. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor slip: “colorless sky” is generic amid otherwise exact detail; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with emotional beats; sentence variety avoids template churn. Figurative language is selective—four well-spaced metaphors across 700+ words—each extending vineyard/transport overlap. No mixed metaphors; “wine remembers both” keeps oenological logic. Scaffolding almost absent; only minor near-repeat “almost stayed / almost left” is purposeful echo, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Mixed metaphors are few and purposeful—“fold sound into itself” is brief, not cluttered. No template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density is high: one sentence often anchors setting, stakes, and sensory detail simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrically taut: information-dense lines (“numbered in a careful, almost apologetic hand”) do double duty. Metaphors are fresh and consistent—lavender as archive, machines as whales—never crowding a single beat. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “as if” clauses in early factory description (−0.2). Final third is clean; rhythm accelerates naturally toward closure image, earning high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “words themselves were watching” sets tone + character paranoia. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (sound = light).

    Prose density is high: “statues made of air and timed sprinklers and stolen theater smoke” packs three sensory sources into one breath without clogging. Rhythm modulates from long cadences of description to clipped fragments under pressure (“It was smaller and more stubborn than that”). Only one minor scaffold: “the sound of growing older trying to clear its throat” appears twice in close succession; the second could be cut. Otherwise no synonym loops or mixed metaphors; each image extends the beach-as-instrument motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Almost every sentence performs at least two jobs: exposition + sensory hit, or action + thematic seed. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Opening clause “looked less like a building than a lantern” instantly anchors image and tone. Closing line “sealing their brief, stolen clarity” snaps shut with percussive consonance—no syllable wasted.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence layers image, motion, and lore; no paraphrase loops. Mixed-metaphor risk in “quiet banners”/”patient compass” but pattern stays legible. Minor scaffold in “years of fearful, reverent ascent” could trim, yet doesn’t dull closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “the still mouth was too well tuned” packs counterfeit thesis into six words.  No loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances the star-map motif or deepens the fracture metaphor.  Mixed-metaphor guard passes—“constellations” and “smudges” coexist because both are anchored to Tomas’s blueprint.  Closing line “doubt felt almost bearable” gives cadence shift that resolves the lyric accumulation without explain-all exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and breathing space, mirroring sanding strokes. Information density high: one line often fuses action, memory, sensory cue (“The grotto settles… mist folding like petals”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse enough to retain clarity. Minor register lift (“zephyr bloom”) is voice-motivated and taught early; does not obscure causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace—longer clauses for approach, clipped fragments when she kneels. No metaphor clutter; each figure extends moss/server fusion. Minor scaffold: “together they pressed…” re-states action already implied, but the final line lands clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm swells and breathes with the river; sentence length modulates pressure. High information density: each sentence layers metaphor, sensory cue, and emotional tilt. No mixed metaphors—shell/river/page imagery interweaves cleanly. Minor scaffold: “He watched…he heard…he felt” triplet could vary openings, but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but patterned early—readers learn to expect metaphoric catalog, so density feels taught, not accidental. No mixed metaphors; “paths furred with moss” stays physiologically coherent. One paraphrase loop risk: “listened” appears twice in adjacent clauses, but the second is upgraded to embodied act, so loop is minor. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, earning echo without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is extreme—every line layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—yet remains audible and uncluttered. No scaffold loops; each image recurs only to reweight meaning (starlight, orchard, map). Figurative coherence holds: star-drop as dew on atlas sustains physical logic. Minor register elevation (“luminous diagram”) is voice-motivated, forgiven under lyric mode; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies from cavernous long clauses to tight clicks (“soft click”). Metaphors are internally coherent (spring “coiled like a question,” gears “twitched like a dreaming animal”) and never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each description adds a new functional detail (chalk lines, mirror flashes). Information density is high—one sentence can layer sensory cue, tool action, and emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is musical; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense yet each metaphor does double duty—“old coins” links value and bruise, economy and pain. One paraphrase loop (“boundary-lessly trapped” echoed twice) is purposeful, teaching the paradox. No mixed vehicles; clarity intact even at peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level density is high: single sentences do triple duty (“ash was forgiving, that it bent toward purpose instead of splintering” = theme seed, character memory, foreshadowing of cut). Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are purposeful and internally consistent (circus time = beads on string; kettle = brief permission of heat). Variation in sentence length creates breathing without algorithmic feel. Opening and closing lines are propulsive and Image-charged. Minor alliteration over-indulgence (“rust-hued peace”) is earned by context, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are dense but purposeful—lagoon as skin of mirrored gears—tied to POV’s mechanical obsession. One paraphrase loop: “They call me a resolute scavenger, but resolve is only what remains…” restates the same idea; minor deduction. No register drift; diction stays within scavenger’s plausible lexicon. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the circular motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often maps pipe, memory, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; “rusted trucks and rattled out” is the only near-cliché, forgiven by sonic fit. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“feral equations” keeps hydraulic logic. Final paragraph trims modifiers, letting dawn light carry cadence. One typo-free read-aloud pass.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene: long suspended clauses in quiet opening, shorter percussive fragments during gear-coaxing. Figurative language is selective—brass teeth as “bad memories,” ink serif as “apology”—and paid off in closure image. No looped stems or synonym churn; information density high. Minor overworld near “petrichor nostalgia” but scent-anchor justifies. Final line cadence satisfies ear.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: paragraph lengths visually narrow as depth increases, mirroring descent. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors in the dive paragraph—so “cold as truth” feels earned not decorative. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Minor friction: “thoughtfully clear” is reused twice in close proximity, a hairline repetition that slightly dulls an otherwise sharp vocal instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    High-density lines (“snow soaked his trousers… hemp and twist”) do double duty; no synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“fog rolled like a slow thought”—is earned by pattern, not muddled; zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence music is deliberate but controlled; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density peaks at “laces of low mist” yet remains coherent. Minor scaffold: “roses bowing beneath their own unpruned abundance” could trim to “roses bowed under unchecked cane,” but image is vivid. Propulsion stays high; each paragraph advances either spatial leg or emotional disclosure. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths modulate from drum-beat fragments to elongated coils. High information density—each line advances image, world, and theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator jargon, not story text; text itself avoids such meta-terms. Metaphors are consistent (industrial = garden) and physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “fire loved distraction” does double duty as metaphor and character memory. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—one mixed metaphor (“flames leaping… doubling the terror”) but it does not touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with heat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; long anacoluthic sentences mirror the slow accretion of anomalies, then fracture into bird-like shards at climax. Information density high—each sentence layers image, world-rule, and emotional temperature. Only one paraphrase loop (“defiant hush” repeated) but it functions as intentional motif, not scaffold, so waived. No mixed metaphors; all figurative vehicles obey the city’s memory-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, emotion, or concept. Metaphors are physically coherent—“petals of ionized dust,” “spiral arm curling back to strike itself”—and never mixed. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges every prior petal and gear. Prose breathes with scene tempo, accelerating into shorter clauses when familiar constellations threaten, then lengthening into lullaby cadence at close.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “slow river of color,” “glass bones of its roof tick” do double sensory duty. One mixed metaphor—“ribbon unwinding like a thin, determined river” beside an actual river of butterflies—momentarily blurs, but the image recovers by aligning both rivers of grief. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty: “the sea rose faster than my pride could retreat” advances both clock and guilt. Figurative language is selective, never overwriting the pause beat. Rhythm mirrors pendulum arc—long sentences swell, fragments snap. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with image precision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm varies from lush cumulative clauses to stark single images ("the hatch gaped"). Metaphors are selective and paid off: "sealed cobalt candle" returns as throat that clears itself. Zero loops or synonym churn; no scaffold sentences. High information density—one sentence often reveals tool, body, and emotional tilt simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (world-rule, interior, foreshadow). Metaphors are precise—“frozen bolt of night,” “thoughts frayed like worn rope”—and never mixed. No scaffold; each paragraph advances either data tension or moral pressure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final pen-stroke, then stops on the single-word future—perfect cadence match.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: “ash still drifted… sifting down like gray snow onto her pages” does triple duty (setting, stakes, foreshadowing). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is single, coherent. One mixed vehicle: “stubborn as cinders” clashes with earlier “gray snow,” but it’s local and doesn’t touch closure. Rhythm breathes with scene—short clauses under threat, longer when copying.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: “ash lines tracing invisible boundaries” folds setting, stakes, and gesture into one clause. No synonym loops; each ash fall finds fresh tactile verb—drifts, settles, powders. Rhythm breathes with the slow circle, then snaps shut on “nobody pretends they are safe.” One mixed metaphor—“electric quiet”—but it’s early and taught, forgiven. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence layers sensory, historical, and moral data without scaffolding. Metaphors are precise—“history’s compost,” “broken teeth”—and stay physically coherent. One paraphrase loop mid-way (“manuals matter…manuals dry”) is minor; no artifact touches closure. Rhythm accelerates on beat-changes, then settles into the final cadence of settling silt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “war had brushed this town only lightly” packs consequence into a single tactile verb. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—velvet, frost, breath—without purple drift. Final chord is rendered with syntactic simplicity that lets the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: “salt, rust, mildew, and beneath it all the thin citrus sting of old hope” does four jobs in nine words. No scaffold loops; occasional adjectival richness is pattern-taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“synaptic plasticity”) is brief and motivated by seed mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the tiny rasp loud as a spark,” “words falling like coins in a steel tray.” Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent—lightning as drink, drones as bees, truth as toll. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with beats: long sentence for dusk thickness, staccato for hive ignition. One filter-verb cluster (“she told herself”) is voice-motivated and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence delivers arrival, tide-breath, lint-wrapped shard, and grandmother lore without padding. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors avoided; “shard of hush” is singular and precise. No template cadence or synonym loops; sentence openings vary. Artifacts absent from closure beat; final image reads clean and resonant aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each sentence layers geology, history, and moral pressure. Metaphors stay internally consistent (ink, stone, tide). One paraphrase loop: “certainty had cracked wide enough for nuance to root” echoes earlier “cracked wide enough” but is deliberate reprise. No filter-verb clusters or mixed vehicles. Final line cadence slows to match receding water—rhythm serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—image and abstraction—without scaffold. The only micro-loop is the repeated “no first step and no last” echo, but it is purposeful refrain, not churn. Metaphors (“diagram for perpetual motion sketched by an exhausted god”) are audacious yet internally coherent. Clause length varies to create breath-points on the climbs, and no artifact touches the final crack image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “The water shivered, thin strands of light coiling up into the bristles as if inhaled” advances action, setting, and metaphor without scaffold. No paraphrase loops; each image is new yet echoes prior motifs (saffron, moon, breath). Register stays within Aurelia’s painterly lexicon; no thesaurus churn. Final paragraph slows cadence to match hushed city, propelling closure rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from long atmospheric clauses to short declaratives at pressure points; no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor (“world that had already decided to vanish”) is minor; information density high, every sentence advances stakes or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is architectural: long, mineral-heavy lines build atmosphere, then fracture into staccato beats at the cast. Metaphors are precise—“basalt shining with a faint, latent radiance of trapped daylight”—and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each line advances setting, motive, or mechanism. Opening and final lines perform symmetric inversion: dusk arrival vs. future unspooling, cementing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and mostly propulsive; sentences open varied and carry double duty (image + stakes). Two micro-loops: “lingering luminance” repeated four times; “repulsive allure” twice without new nuance—minor scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (mirrors as curtains, crowd as negatives). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final line “darkness waits patient without hunger” is crisp, high-information closure. Typos absent; punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear rewards varied sentence openings andclause lengths that mimic sea-surge without falling into template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent: “brine-sweet petals” is precise, not purple. One mixed metaphor—“paths snarled together like knotted rigging”—is justified because rigging is literal environment. Information density high: one sentence can do setting, sensory tilt, and foreshadow (“apples clacking like teeth”). No scaffold or synonym loops; each noun earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—worldbuild and characterize: “barnacled continents sighing through the tides.” Figurative language is selective, pattern-taught, and never muddles causality; mixed metaphors absent. Rhythm breathes—long lyrical coils contract into clipped final clause: “Then the turtles began to turn.” No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; no filter-verb stacks in peak beat. Clean copy; pronoun reference stable.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero filter-verb clusters; high density—“ivy pressed through broken windows like thick handwriting” does triple sensory, metaphorical, thematic work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges ivy/letter motifs. Metaphors stay internally coherent under the station’s glass-and-green logic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer job title, secret calling, and grandfather relic. Metaphors are coherent—pavilion as drowned lantern, grout as sleep—without mixed logic. Rhythm varies: staccato “She writes…” anaphora accelerates urgency, then slows into final lucid dark. One paraphrase loop (“absence layered within absence”) is purposeful echo, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Figurative language is selective—no mixed-metaphor clutter—and metaphors serve causality (tides vs. civic pressure). Minor scaffold: two adjectives in “faint, papery hush” could trim to one, and “reclaimed stillness flooded” is nearly self-repetition of “stillness flooded,” but these are hairline. Overall rhythm breathes with scene needs and closure line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify from gerund to verb to prepositional phrase. Figurative control is precise—“sparks of seawater leap”—and never muddled; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “lanterns sway…lanterns shatter” re-uses the noun without fresh angle, but this is outside the closure beat. Information density is high; every sentence adds image, motion, or emotional charge. No loops, no synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence advances image or concept (“Every perturbation is a small echo of the blast…”). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary from one-line punches to longer orbital sweeps. One mixed-metor stretch (“question mark that never closed” adjacent “bleeding constellations”) is hairline; it does not obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene: tight clauses under the dome’s pressure, then expansive star-catalogue sentences. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors—though “brilliant dimness” and “invisible cable” flirt with oxymoron clutter; context justifies them. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with discovery: long, tide-like sentences roll toward revelation, then crack into staccato fragments at epiphany. Metaphors are coherent—time as pulsing watch, erased lives as driftwood softened by salt—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each image advances knowledge or cost. High information density: “I forged documents that severed me from my blood” performs backstory, motive, and crime in one line.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm climbs in clenched cadences toward the lantern release, then fractures into two short sentences that let the silence in. Mixed metaphors are grounded (“mist crawled like a low animal”) and physically coherent. One scaffold echo—“between apology and forgiveness” repeated—earns its keep by becoming the moral fulcrum. No filler stacks; every clause adds sensory or tactical data.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers map-memory, sensory body, and tide motion. Metaphors are controlled—“GPS channels collapse” marries tech and emotion without crowding. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line cadence resolves by image. High density with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with escalation: caesura-heavy openings accelerate into torch-cut sparks, then slow to dripping algae cadence. Metaphors stay consistent (lake as bruised lung, applause no one wins) without mixed-vehicle crashes. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. One near-purple line (“breathing through its wounds”) is earned by prior bodily imagery, not decorative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like ritual chant; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high: one line can do scent, myth, and bodily change. Two stacked metaphors (“moon… nailed to the sky,” “distance… width of the moon”) flirt with excess but paid off when moon becomes literal nail for phoenix embers. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new sensory or causal information. Metaphors are physically coherent—clouds as altar, mist as bridge—never mixed. High information density: “deck was heavy with onyx dust and river-silted ink” does world, texture, and river-memory in one stroke. Final third is clean of figurative overload; clarity of bridge image remains pristine, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the weight shifts; no two adjacent sentences open the same way. Every clause hauls double duty—world, emotion, and stakes in one pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. The single visible artifact is the repeated “shadow work” label, but it is introduced as historical jargon and re-inflected by use, so it reads as intentional echo, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors stay coherent: banked coal → green-gold constellations → pumice scraped heart, all volcanic continuum. No filter-verb stacks; perception is direct: “ground hot beneath his soles.” Final line “black tongue short of the camps” is crisp, synecdochic closure. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises and falls with evacuation tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often does description, character, and foreshadowing—“Its outer walls shimmered with bottled daylight, yet the corridors inside kept a winking hush.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent (engine=fort, compass=sundial) and do not collide. Variation in sentence length and paragraphing mirrors tension; final line lands with ominous cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: short percussive clauses at the cliff edge, liquid elongation during eel flight. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphor density peaks only at the closure beat where “ink drying on proof” marries cosmos and ledger. Line-level artifacts zero; no scaffold, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances argument, image, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“rebuttals made of thrust”) is patterned early and paid off, avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clauses vary in length to mimic fencing tempo. Minor filter verbs remain voice-motivated, e.g., “he realized,” immediately grounded in sensory proof.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the drip of rain through the open roof” does triple duty—setting, stakes, metronome. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“molts personalities monthly like a snake abandons skins”—and never cluster in a single beat. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric runs (“Back then… Now…”) collapse into staccato under flashlight beams. One paraphrase ripple: “beauty did not have to be gentle to be holy; it could snarl” borders thematic assertion, but the next sentence re-embodies it through action, neutralizing the slip before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Varied sentence rhythm mirrors film sprocket skips and long sea-swell breaths; no loops or template cadence. Figurative language is disciplined—mixed metaphors avoided even under pressure. Information density high: “needles turning not north but toward remembered choices” does three jobs in ten words. Closure beat is uncluttered, letting the final chord image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “reefs would forget where to grow, turtles where to crawl ashore, lovers whom to wait for” compresses ecological, zoological, and emotional stakes in one line. Metaphors are coherent—luminous doubt, storm-river wrinkles—and avoid purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “simple in words and complicated in practice” echoes later “simple yet complicated” but occurs early and is brief. Final image is uncluttered, letting “luminous doubt pool in his chest” carry the reweighting without additional figurative scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like surf: long sentences for mist, fragments for compass click. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interior). No loops or synonym churn; “rhythmically placid” returns twice but each time retooled (breeze, then lungs). Minor scaffold: “the severance had taken…” paragraph summarizes off-stage events; however, it lands early and primes present stakes without stalling momentum. Closure line breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water had risen past the third-floor observatory, swallowing her simulations” compresses loss into visceral action. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent—dust as “drifting archive,” grief as “serrated to dull”—without mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“quiet and cumulative”) echoes opening’s “dull, cloud-choked sky,” creating resonant closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“charcoal smuggler's ledger strip… a black tongue of paper fused to green glass”). Figurative language is coherent within the glass/fire motif system; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Behind me… Each step…”) delivers earned resonance without scaffold or loop. Minor density in mid-section (“frost… trade routes… ledger”) slightly slows momentum but serves thematic accrual.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“fires bloomed like poppies among buildings, yet even the flames forgot how to roar”) but avoids overwriting. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. One minor redundancy: “mute catastrophe” echoes earlier “airless hush,” but not enough to dull closure. Figurative logic remains coherent—vibration as memory, heat as emotion—without mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, and figurative language (“sea opened like an eye,” “books drifted like slow fish”) serves atmosphere without muddling causality. Minor overwriting in the library description (“bound in materials he could not name… moment before a person spoke”) borders on purple but remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character or setting. Closure beat is clear, though one mixed metaphor (“water thick as sleep lifted him”) slightly blurs physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and stakes (“Wind threaded through the hollow tiles above her, turning the quiet into something sharp”). No loops or scaffold—figurative language is purposeful (“bell… dulled by years of fingerprints and border dust”). Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“silence felt like an intake of breath”) crystallizes closure without purple prose. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mist, light, breath) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“birds trapped in a library”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors shared breath—gradual, soft, lifting—culminating in an image that crystallizes the story’s emotional core without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (halo “humming like a trapped throat,” bridges rising “like startled serpents”) and pattern-taught early. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; high information density without clutter. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates dissolution without sacrificing clarity—“fray,” “smeared,” “quaking reverie” land with earned force.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“stuffed bears that had never been won” implies societal collapse). Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (chains as “reluctant applause,” tickets as “molted scales”). Rhythm varies naturally—short staccato phrases during tension (“He cursed, shoving her back”) contrast lyrical cadences (“coax stubborn green from exhausted dust”). Final line’s “staggering grace” resolves with rhythmic and thematic precision, recharging the opening paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense with zero loops: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“skeletal trunks grope,” “hulls split by greed vs. storm rage”). Figurative language is coherent—colors as textures, absences as bruises—and never muddles peak beats. Syntax varies naturally (fragments for tension, complex sentences for reflection), and the final line (“a battered marvel continually repaired by those who choose to hear”) recharges the opening blue sigh with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “moonbeams… pale threads quivering whenever I exhaled” conveys emotion, object, and atmosphere). Figurative language is coherent—light motifs evolve without contradiction. Minor overwriting in the middle (“fleeting golden sunset smeared like disbelief”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats avoid purple prose. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm, especially the stark final line.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence performs multiple duties (atmosphere + character + theme). Figurative language is coherent (“cables lay like frozen rivers,” “bookmark… sleeping worm of memory”) and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in one high-pressure beat (“amber brightness” followed by “translucent spine”), but clarity at closure remains unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict (“books sealed in clear plastic like organs in jars”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (decay, wiring, coding) and pays off—fear “kinked like a wire” echoes in the shell “half wired.” Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety mirrors emotional cadence. Final paragraph’s block letters (“TRUST HURTS…”) land with rhythmic clarity. Minor deduction: one slightly elevated phrase (“transformative betrayal”) risks register drift but is offset by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “flakes of gilt clung to her fingers, glimmering like tiny shipwrecked constellations” conveys character history, object state, and thematic resonance in one image. Rhythm varies purposefully—long sentences for atmosphere, fragments for tension (“Darkness strode in”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light/silence as navigational media). Minor overwriting in “marbled hush pooled inside” slightly dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose achieves near-flawless information density: “icicles hung like organ pipes” conveys sound, shape, and sacred resonance in seven words. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (“dust hangs undecided in the air” mirrors liminal cognition) and never overwrought. Final line’s cadence—simple subject-verb-object—resolves the story’s tension with quiet authority, proving mastery of read-aloud rhythm and syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“beading condensation as though it had been sweating fear”).

Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor deduction only because one metaphor (“glass marbles”) borders on familiar, though context redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or ritual logic. Figurative language is pattern-taught (silver veins, humming blossoms) and pays off in closure (listening seeds). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“fox-shadows, moths with translucent ribs…”) slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned stasis—no loops, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “Midnight pooled in the grass like ink” establishes setting, tone, and motif in seven words. Rhythm varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for memory; short, staccato phrases for climax (“He gathered the cards... turned back down”). One minor overwriting slip: “river-silted ink” slightly strains verisimilitude, but figurative coherence holds. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“could not reclaim... but could meet”) crystallizes theme without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (e.g., “faded images of faces I would never meet, their surfaces filmed with salt like frost” conveys loss, setting, and method). Figurative language is pattern-taught (gravitational emotion, tear-refracted memory) and pays off in the climax without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“aggregate shadow of ten billion extinct minds”) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“jars... clinked like tame constellations”; “lava cooled in a black tongue”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (stars/bottles/comet) and payoff-earned, with no mixed metaphors. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for mythic tone; short clauses for urgency (“He ran”). Zero loops or scaffold; information density is high without overwriting. Final line’s “whispering hush of astonished gratitude” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Her real name belonged to the old registry she secretly meant to erase”). Figurative language is coherent (light as promise, fort as engine) and never muddled. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (long descriptive sentences vs. terse dialogue beats). Final paragraph’s cadence—“teeth slipped, weights shifted, and chains sighed”—perfectly mirrors mechanical release without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept (“Colors poured across the sky like melted compasses”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in aurora description (“pages of an unseen proof”), but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “Rain lashed the mountain road behind him, erasing the switchbacks like lines scratched from a stanza” merges setting, character history, and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (weather as censorship, scars as maps). Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor overwriting beat (“bruised halos on the walls”) slightly dilutes peak clarity but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“sunlight scattered... fractured by streaks of old paint”). Figurative language is coherent—light as compass needles, needles as swords—and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; syntactic variety creates rhythm (fragments, complex clauses). Final line (“the hidden overture finally began”) resolves with charged poise, recharging all prior motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “books spilled into the streets like contraband birds” conveys history, tone, and theme in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (molting, blooming, rust) and payoff-focused—no purple overwriting. Sentence variety propels momentum: short staccato beats during patrol (“boots crunching glass”) contrast lyrical stretches. One minor artifact: “forged beauty from anarchy” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by “coffee tin” concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“film spooled like cobweb,” “bench sway with some invisible tide”). Figurative language is coherent (music/film motifs unify metaphors) and peaks without muddle—the compass flare “snapping upward” avoids mixed vehicles. Minor redundancy in “flickering compasses”/“hesitant light” slightly dulls one beat, but no loops or scaffold impede momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythmic variation (“Wherever we go… offbeat, together”) delivers closure with earned musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“luminous doubt” appears thrice, evolving from ambient light to internal state to pre-rain weight) without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally (fragments, complex clauses, inverted constructions). Final line (“bright and heavy as rain before it falls”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-text (“wrinkles look like riverbeds cut by luminous doubt”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or motif. Figurative language is coherent (“sky the color of rinsed ink,” “ghost ships…vessels for what people had been too late to say”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary organically. One near-overreach: “rhythmically placid” repeats verbatim, but it’s voice-motivated (his fixation on rhythm), so only minor deduction.
