  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "seeking solace in the profound silence" / "the quiet canyon under the stars had become her sanctuary" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the frost-examination passage with repeated "seemed to" and "certain patterns" stems. Stock metaphors ("force of physical blow," "vast tapestry of stars") and elevated diction ("drifting resonance," "scorched testament") cluster without pattern-teaching. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carrying the drifting resonance of the stars within her"), triggering the elevated deduction and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "The capsize survivor had…" recurs; "unshaken marvels" appears five times without functional variation; adjacent sentences restate the same content ("discovered that emotions created heat patterns" / "had developed a method for heat-mapping emotions"). Stock metaphors ("symphony hall," "silent orchestra") and therapy-speak ("rectify," "newfound purpose") reduce specificity. Line-level density is low, with many sentences doing a single job and scaffolding evident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "giving rest a permanent address" is stated in paragraph 11, repeated in paragraph 26, and rephrased in the final line without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "No longer…Elias became," "The underwater city had found," "Every book, every soul, every lost thought now had" (three parallel summary statements). Stock metaphors—"chased stillness," "silver thoughts"—appear without fresh inflection. Figurative density in descriptive passages (rainbows, vibration, whispers, song) does not always advance story or character, particularly in the library discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean with few mechanical errors, and paragraphs vary in length. Sentence openings show some variety, though several paragraphs begin with subject-noun constructions in a row. The phrase "amplified quiet" appears twice without reweighting, and "anonymous donations" is invoked three times across the text in similar contexts—mild thematic echo but no loop that obscures causality. A few abstract intensifiers ("unexpected strength," "renewed purpose") tell rather than show. Rhythm is steady but does not accelerate under pressure. No figurative muddle or filter-verb stacks harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops mar key beats: "unused love began to transform into light" / "love never disappears, it simply changes form" / "where unused love is stored" / "how to release it back into a world that so desperately needs its healing" recycle the same concept across four paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the coda: "When others asked...she would simply smile...Sometimes she would place...As they breathed deeply, their posture would soften, their eyes would clear, and stories would tumble forth." Stock metaphors—"purple waterfalls," "keeper of light," "pilgrim of sparks"—populate the closure beats, dulling specificity. The final third carries the highest artifact density, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs seven and fourteen both describe fading photographs/memories; paragraphs six and twenty-seven both narrate "retrocognitively trapped." Template cadence runs appear in the early garden description ("Each bridge seemed… responding… with subtle movements") and the vision sequence ("She reached out… only for it to disintegrate… The experience was terrifying yet intoxicating"). Stock metaphors ("tapestry woven from infinite possibilities," "threads that connected yesterday to tomorrow") cluster without fresh inflection. Figurative density in the halo-touch beat (paragraphs 5–9) lacks coherent vehicle: light "bends," time has "texture," consciousness "floats"—mixed registers that reduce clarity. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−1.0) for loops, template stems, and stock strings; total deduction ~−1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "staggering grace" recurs three times without reweighting, and "chained liberator" is restated as concept in the final paragraph. Template stems proliferate: "She had just begun… when she heard," "As she pressed… a soft click echoed," "When the wall came down… it would destroy." The piano-key sequence and arrow-as-lockpick are narrated with vague mechanics—no sensory resistance or failed attempts to anchor the action. Register drifts into stock metaphor ("burned bright," "surge of hope") in peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally high, but numerous paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences dull momentum. "The battered marvel of his profession" appears twice identically. "While cells divide/divided" recurs three times without variation or added pressure. Several sentences restate prior content: the greenhouse's water amplifies color-sounds (paragraph 13), then Kael's hearing aids translate color-sounds (paragraph 14) with minimal new information. Figurative language is dense (frozen glass, snow on battlefield, ice breaking on lake) but some vehicles blur. Sentence openings repeat: multiple paragraphs begin "The," "He," "His," creating rhythmic monotony. Information density is uneven; key beats (the capture moment, the final realization) are told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentences are mostly clear and grammatically clean, but several passages rely on stock phrasing: "practiced gaze," "impossible grace," "luminous disbelief" (repeated). The phrase "illuminated moments weren't捕捉 in paint" contains a non-English character that breaks clarity. Information density is uneven—the flower-code mechanism is mentioned but never explained or demonstrated, creating a logic gap. The final paragraphs stack abstraction ("hearing not a sound but understanding everything") that deflates momentum rather than propelling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "abandoned his studio… abandoned control room… abandoned dreams… abandoning us"; "thawing heart… thaw… thus, we thaw"; "contemplative glassblower" repeated five times. Stock metaphors ("captured sunlight," "dust motes danced") and therapy-speak ("thoughtfully spirited," "emotional winter"). The dramatic-narration conceit is told but never enacted in rhythm or syntax. Paragraph-cut test fails—multiple paragraphs restate the thawing/abandonment theme without advancing knowledge or situation. Simultaneous action errors: "during ice melting" used twice as awkward framing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops throughout: paragraph 2 ("secret phobias...claustrophobia and cleithrophobia warred") is immediately restated in paragraph 7 ("phobias had made her...terror threatening to paralyze"). Template cadence runs dominate: "The seashell had been...the seashell murmured...the seashell grew warmer...the seashell whispered" (−0.6). Mixed metaphors: "vulnerability is power" contradicts "unstoppable power of absolute truth." Elevated diction in crisis beats ("menacing silhouettes," "cascading starlight," "adrenaline-fueled action films") flattens immediacy. Artifacts touch closure beat (final paragraph recycles "unstoppable power"), triggering disallow 9+ globally and cap 8.8 per artifact rule (−1.7 baseline).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" alternate without clear functional distinction; "retell," "summarizing silence," and interpreting absence recur in adjacent paragraphs restating the same concept. Template stems ("The oracle…") open multiple paragraphs. Figurative density ("veins of different minerals," "canvas," "held breath") saturates the closure paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. These artifacts dull momentum and lower information density in the final third, touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening third: "dusted… cleaning expertise… cleaning routine," "existential processors that constantly questioned its purpose… where did its thoughts come from," "new purpose and a new name." Template cadence appears in the middle ("In potential timeline 47… In timeline 112") and near the end ("The second chance program had always been… The second chance program had succeeded"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("harmonious synthesis of machinery and music," "mystical moment of self-discovery") that clashes with the janitor-robot POV. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, but pervasive template cadence mars momentum: "She spotted," "She picked," "She realized," "She understood," "She decided" create a list-like stem pattern across key beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("not through sound, but through visual representations" / "not to invade privacy but to create understanding"), applying −0.6 for template runs and −0.2 for synonym loops (−0.8 total in Q7). Figurative language ("ambiguously clear," "resonant hush," "thaw mistrust") is used correctly but remains abstract rather than embodied in concrete sensory anchors. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate Elara's realization without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "blooming withering" is restated as "life and death existing in the same breath, the same space" and "dying yet eternally renewed." Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs with "He would [verb]" and "Elias [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors like "silent witnesses" and "the realm of the heart" reduce specificity. The phrase "mended deception" recurs without evolution. Sentence rhythm is monotonous, with most paragraphs following a similar reflective declarative structure. Information density is low—many sentences restate the same philosophical stance without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "mechanically warm" appears four times, "subdued awakenings" thrice, "magnetic nexus at twilight" four times, "within the hush of beating wings at rest" twice, and "through holographic principles" thrice—each often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added pressure or detail. Template-cadence runs dominate ("Aris [verb], her [noun]..."; "The [ordinal] lever [verb]..."). Stock metaphors ("doors yet unopened," "velocity of discovery") and label-only interiority ("icy warmth coursing through her veins") dull line-level momentum. These artifacts appear throughout, including in the closure paragraph, triggering the high-end artifact penalty (−1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and carries atmospheric density, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate concepts without adding pressure: "the space that existed in between—the liminal threshold" (para 2), "hauntingly familiar yet utterly alien" echoed by "ancient and new, like a memory of something never experienced" (para 14). Figurative language clusters heavily in reflective beats ("pearls in the deep," "shimmering stars in a midnight sky," "sanctuary of sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("暧昧 possibility," "transcended spoken words," "mortal and eternal") occurs repeatedly. These artifacts accumulate across the piece, dulling momentum and clarity at key moments, triggering deductions under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence mar multiple beats: "the proposition that neither fate nor free will truly existed, but rather something between them, quantum-like and unpredictable until observed" restates the concept without adding pressure; "For hours, Elias worked systematically...Each smudge revealed another fragment until the pattern emerged" summarizes action rather than dramatizing it. Stock metaphors ("fever breaks," "clarity that always comes," "mountain air") and elevated diction ("subcutaneous map," "meteoric origin") clash with the scene's immediacy. The final paragraph stacks simultaneity constructions ("drawn toward," "would finally discover," "asked to be returned") that blur action sequence. Information density is low; many sentences restate concepts without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops and thematic restatement pervade the final two paragraphs: "swallowed truth" appears three times with synonym churn ("secrets that need to be spoken," "truths that refuse to stay buried," "his own swallowed truths"). Template cadence runs across multiple sentences in the opening ("adjusted," "cutting," "formed," "moved") and ending. The final paragraph summarizes the entire arc in abstract terms rather than advancing through image or action, stalling closure momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("he'd learned," "he felt," "he realized") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. The opening paragraph contains minor overwriting: "cascading murk," "fleeting patterns," "weathered hands" stack figurative touches without propulsion. "Drift of untold seasons" recurs twice as a phrase without variation. The swan's "cryptic folds" appears three times, bordering on template cadence. No paraphrase loops, and clarity remains high. Deduct −0.4 for patterned repetition that does not escalate meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but suffers from scaffold artifacts and template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "She had learned that resilience wasn't about strength but flexibility" immediately restates the sagebrush metaphor. Runs of identical stems in the eclipse sequence ("Some days called for… others required…" / "Maya recognized… remembering…") create a mechanical rhythm. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "sanctuary of sound," "symphony of healing," "aromatic sentinels," "hush of dreaming roots" pile up in the opening third without constraining later action. Apply −0.8 for loop and template-cadence issues across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "bronze quiet" recurs decoratively in five paragraphs; "sensitively perceptive" restated multiple times; "fragment of a medieval tapestry showing dragons" repeated verbatim. Template stems: "The odd historian…" opens four beats; "The bronze quiet…" opens three. Figurative language ("like moth wings," "like worn fabric," "like stars at dawn") clusters without pattern-teaching. Final-third artifacts ("sense of purpose that transcended") dull the ending and disallow 9+ globally. Information density is low—most sentences restate atmosphere or motivation without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the middle: paragraphs 11–14 recycle "prophetic," "open secrets," "directing flow," and "transpose" without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates—"The writer had," "He hadn't," "Now he worked," "His motivation was"—across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors (tide, beacon, seeds) accumulate without fresh specificity. Information density is low; most sentences restate the mission rather than advance it. Rhythm never varies with scene need.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence dominates: "He pressed... his voice," "He added another loop," "He dipped his brush," "He added the final element." Paraphrase loops recur ("unraveled stillness" appears three times with synonym churn: "knit itself back together," "rewoven into something new"). Stock mystical metaphors ("silence that precedes creation," "sonic architecture," "dimensional anchor") appear without fresh inflection. Figurative density in the climax ("dimensional anchor grew stronger, more defined," "symbols flared brightly then faded") stacks abstractions that blur causality. Filter-verb reliance ("seemed to absorb," "felt like a physical weight") dulls immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate setup without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "chronologically homesick" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "memories flowed" and "memories transformed into music" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the mid-section ("Memories flowed… each memory… With each memory") and stock metaphors ("like water," "like musical notes") accumulate without fresh variation. Clarity remains high, but information density is low due to synonym churn and conceptual redundancy across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary adequately; no glaring loops or scaffolding across adjacent lines. Clarity is maintained throughout, and grammar/punctuation are clean. However, multiple beats recycle "Elias [verb]" stems without propulsion ("Elias stood," "Elias placed," "Elias understood"), creating mild template cadence (−0.4). Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats ("gift and curse," "hope mixed with growing dread," "beautifully complex") without fresh embodiment (−0.3). Information density is moderate—many sentences describe without advancing pressure. The confluence of template cadence and stock metaphor in non-closure beats warrants a −0.7 total deduction from a baseline ~6.1.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "audibly muted except for the occasional scrape" / "cavern, typically audibly muted except for the occasional drum test." Template cadence dominates with "Eleanor [verb]" stems and synonym churn ("filament of hush" appears five times, "backward recorded songs" four times). Stock metaphors ("wrapped around her heart like winter's chill") and scaffolding phrases ("something extraordinary happened," "not only been accomplished but had transformed") flatten momentum. Applied −1.2 for pervasive artifact spread.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5, 11, 14, and 22 all restate "Elias is credibly curious and this led him to danger/truth" with synonym churn. Template cadence appears in beats like "He would nurture integrity… / The quiet courtyard felt… / He would intuit…" (repetitive "He would" stems). Stock phrases cluster: "layered tranquility," "unwitting prisoners," "dawn to a more truthful day." Figurative language misfires—"tranquility momentarily fractured by the memory" mixes temporal modes (dusk present / memory past) without clarity. The loop penalty and template-stem penalties accumulate to approximately −1.2, and one stock metaphor string adds −0.3, totaling roughly −1.5 in non-closure artifact debt.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops accumulate: paragraphs 4–6 restate "the rope represents time" in synonym variations; paragraphs 11–12 loop "pattern = moments/choices." Template cadence appears in multiple "The poet [verb]" and "The [noun] seemed to [verb]" constructions without taught pattern or payoff. Figurative language is dense (tapestry, mandala, bridge, map, landscape) but vehicles occasionally contradict (rope as both "bridge" and "map"). Stock phrases: "warm, ancient surface," "boundaries begin to blur." Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.4, register drift into abstract philosophizing −0.3; cumulative −1.1 in Q7. Additionally, artifacts touch the closure beat ("texture of time had been irrevocably revealed"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally with high-band cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose carries a lyric texture but suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops: "The rainforest had burned" opens and nearly closes the piece; "acoustically perceptive" and "echo-harbor violinist" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. Figurative language is dense but often generic—"tapestry of sound," "symphony of survival," "seeds of a new beginning"—stock metaphors that blur specificity. Sentence stems repeat across beats: "Kael would often," "Kael had discovered," "Kael realized," "Kael understood," creating a mechanical rhythm that flattens momentum. The climactic beat ("notes filled the greenhouse, resonating with the glass walls and the wooden hulls") tells the music's effect rather than showing Kael's physical effort, the bowl's amplification mechanics, or a single concrete sound that "unbinds the silence." Information density is low: multiple sentences restate the same idea (chronic hush is not absence but different music; beauty in the unfinished) without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound, but multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles reduce momentum: "transformation was nearly complete" / "transformation completed"; "counterfeit emotion" appears in nearly every paragraph without variation; "balance" and "paradox" are restated without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final paragraphs ("He locked," "He stepped," "He carried") flatten the ending. No severe artifacts obscure causality, but density is low—most sentences restate Elias's philosophy rather than advancing action or revealing new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "his whimsically attentive nature" is restated across three paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence runs through several beats ("Elias felt… Elias listened… Elias placed…"). The final two paragraphs stack summary sentences with identical stems ("For in the end… And his locket… Thus the cycle…"), each restating the compassion-cycle thesis. Stock constructions appear: "the one that always came when," "something he rarely did," "as before." Figurative language in the closing ("his own composition of human connection") elevates register without concrete grounding. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock phrasing −0.3; artifacts touch closure image, total −1.2 baseline, escalated to −1.5 for closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is largely clear with vivid figurative language ("drink the crater's light and bleed it back") and purposeful rhythm. However, multiple issues accumulate: the untranslated fragment "沟通推进" is a disruptive artifact; "boldly sympathetic regard" and "luminescent ache" recur as abstract labels without embodied grounding; synonym churn appears in "hollowness, a rootless yearning" and "profound and resonant"; the final paragraph stacks modifiers ("glimmering," "radiant," "luminescent") without new information. Template cadence surfaces in repeated "their" constructions during the search sequence. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence across action beats: "The illustrator [verb]," "With one hand…the illustrator leaped," "When he reached…he found," "As he reached…the entire structure lurched" (−0.5). Paraphrase loop: "interrupted cadence" appears in four distinct sentences with near-identical phrasing without adding pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors: "burned within him," "stretched thin," "crystals sparkled with memories" reduce specificity (−0.3). Sentence-level propulsion is present in the rooftop sequence but sags in the chamber description, where exposition replaces action. Information density is mixed: the sketchbook and pendant recur purposefully, but "legend spoke" and "those who feared its power" are scaffolding that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries multiple artifacts: paraphrase loops ("ancient knowledge," "unnerving stillness" reappear as ambient description without added pressure), stock metaphors ("deep water," "rich earth"), and repeated sentence stems ("The [noun] seemed to..."). The final third includes a run of declarative summary sentences that flatten momentum ("This was the moment," "The mathematics of emotion wasn't about..."). Filter verbs ("seemed," "began") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice justification. Line-level opacity does not obscure causality but dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear throughout: "Their motivation, born from years of watching…" echoes "Their technical knowledge had made them custodian…"; multiple paragraphs open with "They had…" or "With…" creating rhythmic monotony (−0.6). The phrase "sense memory" appears three times without evolving meaning. Stock constructions like "flood of sense memory washed over them" and "With reverence, they removed the fragment" flatten momentum. Figurative language ("delicate as a butterfly wing," "highways through the building's infrastructure") is clear but the density of metaphor in descriptive beats occasionally slows propulsion without payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence variety and rhythm serve the material; no catastrophic loops. However, synonym churn appears in the middle third: "control" and variants recur across adjacent paragraphs without added nuance, and "circuitously sincere" (prompt element) is inserted twice via tell rather than shown behavior, reading as token fulfillment (−0.4). The phrase "reluctant metamorphosis" appears verbatim, a label echo (−0.2). Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is moderate—several lines paraphrase prior beats ("her motivation had shifted," "transformation was reluctant") without advancing pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final line resonates but tells rather than shows the classroom lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is high (brooch discovery, exchange, pigment reveal, purpose shift). Two text artifacts harm momentum: "Her paintings artist's heart" (typo/register break) and "ofcolors" (word merge). The phrase "professional courtesy between survivors" is abstract when the exchange could show that courtesy. The visitor epilogue recycles "wryly earnest" without new pressure, a mild loop. Deduct −0.8 for combined artifacts and loops; closure image ("amber brooch... continued to pulse") remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. Deductions: multiple instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("unseen forces had begun to gather" / "overlapping shadows began to inhabit the very air" / "beginning to inhabit the crystalline structures themselves"; "steadily unpredictable" / "steadily unpredictable future"). Template cadence appears in several beats: "The [X] responded…," "As [X], Elara [verbed]…" Stock metaphors ("threads of possibility," "blooming like crystalline flowers") appear in high-pressure moments without fresh specificity. Filter verbs ("seemed," "began to") stack in mid-story beats, dulling immediacy. Information density is moderate; some sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor reliance in peak beats, total −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but template-cadence runs are pervasive: "she found," "she learned," "she witnessed," "she shared." These stems appear in most paragraphs, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "ocean-spray archivist" restated as "her duty to compile fragments," "navigated absences" echoed as "charted the gaps." Figurative density ("tapestry," "seedlings through soil," "waves against the shore") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, total −0.9 in Q7. Information density is moderate; some lines advance but many recapitulate theme.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "The phantom ticket punch grew warmer… vibrating with a purpose" is immediately echoed by "with trembling certainty, he followed the pattern"; "his analytically artistic mind" appears verbatim in early and late paragraphs; the final five paragraphs repeat the mission statement in synonym cycles ("unravel mysteries," "truths he would gently bring to light," "extraordinary calling," "fortress of unspoken truths"). Template cadence runs throughout ("As if summoned…," "As Ethan approached…," "As the vault dissolved…"). Figurative language crowds some beats without clarity: "geometric symphonies," "dissonant harmony that called to him," "fortress of unspoken truths" are stacked metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The −0.6 to −1.4 artifact penalty applies, and these patterns touch the closure, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "transcribe" appears seven times, "forgotten patterns" four times, often in adjacent sentences without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs stack across the final two paragraphs ("The tower remained open… its existence a testament… In transcribing the tile's wisdom… The magic square tile… continued its quiet revelation"). Stock metaphors ("spaces between stars," "ancient migrations") and elevated diction ("conduit," "permeated") obscure rather than sharpen. Information density is low; many sentences restate thematic claims without moving plot or character.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "boredom evaporated, replaced by intrigue" followed two paragraphs later by "no longer a bored immortal" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs: "He had been searching... when his fingers brushed... The cursed amulet fragment hummed... As the solar storm intensified..." stacks participle and subordinate stems across four consecutive beats. Stock metaphors—"stretching like taffy," "final moments of a dying rainbow," "endless dance of creation and destruction"—cluster without fresh vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks in closure paragraph ("understood," "accepted," "found") dull immediacy. Applying −1.4 for loops, cadence, and stock phrasing; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening paragraph anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several lines loop conceptually: "liquefies rigid thinking" is restated twice; "deathly vitality" appears three times with slight variations but no deepening. The phrase "mathematics of a fair trade" recurs without adding new pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a surge of") appear in several high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Clarity and propulsion are sound, but scaffold phrasing and synonym churn in key moments (e.g., "transformation," "transition," "resurrection") lower precision.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and no grammar errors. However, paraphrase loops and scaffold appear: "His motivation was singular and pure: to collect the textures of different times. Most days, he did this by examining..." restates intent across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraphs 11–13 ("This was his core concept... His predecessors had maintained this belief... The notepad contained...") creates expository rhythm without propulsion (−0.4). Figurative language ("golden threads," "scrolls unfurling") appears in reflective beats without earning the metaphor through scene pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes striking ("palimpsest," "stories written in water"), but metaphor saturation in nearly every sentence dulls propulsion (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: lines 19–20 restate "I was once documented, now I am nameless" without advancing pressure (−0.2). Template stems recur: "Each morning…," "By day…," "The tides…," "Across the rhythm…" across six beats (−0.5). Stock phrases ("sweet then gone without trace," "histories written in water") and synonym churn ("erased…overwritten…dissolved") accumulate without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines poeticize rather than advance causality or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Paragraphs 15–17 restate "retell" and "through the cello" across adjacent beats without advancing knowledge. Stock constructions ("with growing enthusiasm," "with recognition dawning") pad pivotal moments. The phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" appears three times without reweighting. No figurative muddle or major artifact at closure, but density is low and momentum sags mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: the dual allegiance concept is restated across four paragraphs without added pressure, and "encoded messages/graffiti" synonyms churn throughout. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "Maya [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" flatten rhythm. The climactic summary ("For three nights, Maya barely slept, mapping graffiti locations and cross-referencing symbols")告 rather than showing pivotal action. Stock metaphors ("splash of cold water," "dance on water") appear without fresh inflection. The final paragraph stacks three thematic restatements where one concrete image would suffice, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean but heavy with scaffold and paraphrase loops. Repeated phrases recur without tightening: "dawning hush" (three times), "moonlit summit" (four times), "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" (five times in near-identical constructions), "purposefully curious" (twice). Adjacent sentences often restate the same content: "She was determined to document their beauty before they vanished forever, a testament to what was being sacrificed" immediately echoes the prior mission statement. Template cadence appears in runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Elena [verb]ed" openings. Information density is low—many sentences perform a single expository job without layering action, perception, or subtext. Figurative language is absent; concision and propulsion are compromised by redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and competent, with varied sentence structure and purposeful sensory detail. However, multiple passages loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "heartfelt artisan" repeated, "mist-coated rail depot" and variants recur decoratively, and the final paragraph restates theme already conveyed. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Elias, a heartfelt artisan… Elias oversaw…"). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("neurons bridging an injury," "ballet in miniature"), and stock metaphors ("beyond repair," "frozen in time") dilute specificity. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than charging the image with fresh propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and vivid images (auroras, inverted deltas, condensation). Minor scaffold appears: "Elmsley moved to the window" and similar choreography narration that could be compressed. "Worrying tranquility" is repeated verbatim without reweighting. The phrase "made his scholarly heart beat faster" and "edge of everything" edge toward stock. No major loops or opacity, but density could tighten in transit beats.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm, though some figurative language verges on overwriting: "dusk bled into the wild hush," "bruised sky," "star-choked sky." Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]. Another [noun]." constructions (paragraph three). Paraphrase loop: "The wild hush settled again, deeper now, expectant" and later "The wild hush deepened, no longer empty" restate similar content. No major loops obscure causality, but these artifacts prevent entry to the high band. Information density is adequate; no scaffolding or synonym churn mars the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive scaffold and loops drag clarity: "gathered hush" appears three times, "lonesome splendor" twice, "magnificent temple" twice, "crystal perfume vial" is repeated across adjacent beats without evolving function. Template cadence runs through the middle: "According to her decrypting... But the chamber remained... Her intensive training screamed..." Stock metaphors proliferate: "descending angels," "captured stars," "pregnant with possibility." The oxygen alarm that "blared insistently" is then "barely registered," a contradiction that obscures urgency at the climax. Paraphrase loops in the final third restate triumph without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "copperlight repose" appears three times with identical function, "sustained impossibilities" twice, "lattice from confessional" five times without evolving use. Template cadence runs: "In the [place]... he [verb]" opens six paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "impossibilities sustained themselves like ghosts refusing to be exorcised" blends vehicle incoherently. Stock phrases abound: "liminal space," "past and present merged," "creating a path where none had existed." Penalty: −1.4 for loops and template cadence touching the closure beat; artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "almost feel… almost… nearly recall" (line 18–19) and "debts of the past had finally been settled" / "the debts had finally been repaid" across paragraphs (−0.4). Template-cadence runs of "The [noun] [verb]" sentence openers pervade the piece without pattern-teaching (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("morning fog," "skeleton weeds") and elevated diction ("immeasurable tenderness") in the closure beat muddle immediacy (−0.3). Figurative language ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings") is repeated as labels rather than dramatized images. Information density is low; many sentences restate setup or theme without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "overlapping" appears five times across adjacent paragraphs without functional variance; "ruin to reverence" repeats three times in identical phrasing. Template cadence runs: "The [noun] had [verb]... The [noun] now [verb]... The [noun] would [verb]" across the final third. Stock metaphors ("dragon spines," "sleeping serpents") and summary scaffolding ("Her work continued," "The seasons would change") dull momentum. The closure beat is buried in summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure, supporting the reflective tone. Several lines carry figurative density without muddle: "water finding its way back to a forgotten spring" and "tree roots embracing its base in silent testament." However, paraphrase loops appear in the final third: paragraphs restating restoration, completion, and homecoming with synonym variation ("faith restored," "journey completed," "most direct path home"). Template cadence in the closing sequence ("Kaelen had completed… sometimes the most… When the next day's light…") slightly flattens momentum. No major clarity breaks, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, multiple lines loop or paraphrase: "something nostalgic yet deeply necessary" echoes "something almost sacred"; "carefully inventive puzzle" and "carefully constructed facades" recycle stems; "between sending and receiving, between identity shed and identity assumed" stacks parallel structures without added density. The final paragraph deploys three instances of "between X and Y" parallelism that dulls rather than propels. Figurative language (the clipboard as "old friend," the equation metaphor) appears functional but not dense. Information density is moderate; several beats expand theme without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity and concision are generally strong, but text-artifact patterns accumulate: "echoed silence" appears three times, "eternal candle" five times with near-identical phrasing, and synonym loops ("whispers"/"whispered secrets," "foolish"/"dim-witted"/"foolishness") cluster without progression. Template cadence in the middle third: "Her true motivation…" / "Today, as…" / "Through adjacent possibilities…" runs identical stems. Purple clusters ("prismatic tears," "galaxy-chart embroiderer," "elongated shadows that became her secret accomplices") blur momentum in the opening and middle without pattern-teaching. These artifacts dull closure and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for touching the final third. The summarized overnight work session loses propulsion when dramatization was needed.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, but several beats rely on template stems ("The singing spirits circled closer," "The gargoyle shard pulsed"). Figurative language is dense in the final third without pattern-teaching ("fierce tenderness," "moment before deciding" repeated). A paraphrase loop appears: "space between them had been bridged" echoes "communicate beyond words" without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines restate rather than advance. The final paragraph summarizes the journey rather than dramatizing a closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs harm momentum: "Kaelen had seen countless objects…" / "The translator knew too well such rituals…" / "Kaelen had once translated…" / "The translator remembered villages…" recycles "Kaelen/The translator [past perfect]" stems across at least six sentences. "Unknot" appears four times, "smudged" three times, and "shrewdly innocent" twice without pattern-payoff. The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but density suffers from synonym churn ("decryption," "unknot," "translate") and near-redundant passages (the coral fragment is described reverently multiple times without new information). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally mixed: "lotus-hearted ache" is elegant yet abstract. Apply −0.9 for template cadence and paraphrase loops (does not touch closure directly but pervades the middle third).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "rediscover lost joy" / "lost joy resurfacing"; "painting with light" recurs without evolving function; "fog-choked" / "fog-bound"; "ancient and new creations seemed to merge" followed by "fragments of the past had developed into a future." Template cadence runs through the middle third with repetitive "She [verb]" stems (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("liquid dawn," "roots had taken hold") and therapy-speak ("capacity for wonder," "collective joy") dull peak beats (−0.4). The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, flattening closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "The first awakening…The second awakening…The third awakening…the fourth awakening…her fifth awakening" creates mechanical segmentation (−0.6). Paraphrase loops recur: "nested awakenings," "pause between question and reply," and "methodically playful" churn without added pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("Russian dolls," "frozen music") and elevated diction ("bewitched," "insatiable curiosity") in peak beats further reduce sharpness (−0.5). Information density is moderate; many lines advance but scaffolding and synonym cycles ("reflected sound," "acoustic patterns," "sound waves") lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "Each member carried their own gourd seed" echoes prior explanation; "converging chaos" recurs three times without added meaning. Template cadence dominates: "The club…," "Their resistance…," "Their preferred method…," "Kaelen himself…" in successive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("spark of defiance," "freedom's taste") appear in the final beat without fresh texture. Information density is low; many sentences restate the surveillance premise or list activities without advancing pressure. Momentum stalls in catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "pain into beauty" appears in three variations across the piece; "shyly unstoppable" is repeated identically twice; "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" recurs verbatim three times without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the opening four paragraphs, each beginning with a similar noun-phrase structure. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "galaxy postcard...pulse with understanding" and "photosynthesize pain" mix metaphors that do not cohere physically. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats: "The poet observed how," "felt how it ensconced," "wondered if this was their purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "tendrils caressing," "emotions humanity had once known but disappeared," "melodies evaporated like dew on glass orchids," "tears that felt like tiny glass orchids unfurling." Mixed metaphors appear (emotions "disappeared" rather than "forgotten," tears as unfurling orchids). Paraphrase loops include "forgotten names"/"forgotten song"/"long-forgotten song" and "museum of extinct feelings" repeated across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "the glass-orchid caretaker" and parallel "Somewhere beyond...beyond..." Clarity remains mostly intact, but overwriting dulls momentum in non-closure beats. Artifacts touch the ending paragraph ("tiny glass orchids unfurling"), triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "interconnected promises" appears eight times, "symphonies of truth" five times, often in adjacent lines restating the same idea without adding pressure. Template cadence dominates—"Her [noun]," "The [noun]," "Elena [verb]"—across long runs. Lines like "The interconnected promises she carried were more than ancient words—they were bridges waiting to be rebuilt" exemplify stock metaphor and scaffold phrasing. The final third is especially loop-heavy, disallowing high-band entry globally. Multiple artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "trembled"/"tremble"/"tremulous" across multiple beats; "breathed"/"breathing" recycled without fresh charge; "dappled" forced into "dappled resolve" and "dappled light." Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" and "Her [noun]" dominate sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("divining rod of innovation," "encrypted compassion") and therapy-speak ("emotional flatlining" is avoided, but "slyly heartfelt" reads label-only). Artifacts cluster in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.2 in Q7 for spread and closure proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    Heavy density of figurative language without clear pattern-teaching: "discarded feathers," "bloomed in her senses," "stubborn dust motes," "swirling in patterns that seemed to shift according to her heartbeat," "paper trails unfurling against the ancient blue." Mixed metaphors ("bloomed...even as it withered") and paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences reduce clarity. Template cadence in mid-section: "She discovered... She began using... she whispered... she discovered..." Overwriting in peak beats (final paragraph) with stacked metaphors that blur propulsion. Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "necessary distances" appears six times with minimal reweighting; "featherly determination" recurs identically. Stock metaphors: "rivers carving canyons," "dust motes in sunbeams." Template cadence in paragraphs 2–4: "After the butterfly effect…" / "Her father had designed…" / "The pilot logbook…" structures echo mechanically. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("liminal spaces," "sacred geometry") not anchored in Elara's lexicon. Filter-verb stacks in middle paragraphs dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for register drift = cumulative −1.3, plus −0.4 cap for non-closure accumulation beyond −0.8 max per rule; net deduction ~−1.1 from a mid-5 starting band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "shadowseam wonder" appears twice; "softly ingenious" recurs as a label three times; "belonging" is restated across adjacent lines in the final paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "In what must have been... / As midnight approached... / Here, suspended..." Stock metaphors ("living stars," "cosmic dance") appear without transformation. The final two paragraphs rephrase the same thematic claim four times. Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") obscures concrete perception. Apply −1.2 for loops/scaffold and −0.4 for stock phrasing touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs 3/10/22/28 all restate "before memory fades" without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence pervades: "The recollectionist [verb]" opens multiple beats mechanically (−0.5). Figurative density is high but often mixed or vague ("emotions transliterating into tangible visions," "transliterating feelings from lives she had touched")—metaphor vehicles shift without coherence (−0.6). Stock phrasing ("piece after piece of the puzzle fell into place," "waltz together") dulls peaks. Information density is low; many sentences rephrase prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and generally clear, with varied sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. However, paraphrase loops recur: "orchestrated serendipity" and "ordering randomness" are restated across multiple paragraphs without added nuance. The bishop piece receives three backstory blocks (mentor, diagonal movements, corporate turning point) that overlap thematically. Template cadence appears in Leo's observation beats: "He opened his eyes… Perfect… Now he spotted… With practiced grace…" Stock phrasing like "etched with stress," "micro-expressions of surprise delight," and "conspirators in his wilderness" reduces specificity. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling forward.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting and template cadence damage momentum. Runs of "her [noun]" constructions ("her movements," "her dances," "her method," "her motivation," "her fingers," "her skin," "her exile," "her dance") create syntactic monotony across twelve sentences. Stock metaphor strings ("pulsing with inner light," "threads of luminous ink," "breathing with ancient knowledge") appear in most sentences of the transformation beat without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops recur: "command the ebb and flow" / "calming storms or calling forth"; "deemed too reminiscent" / "evoked a world before." The artifacts touch the closure beat ("her skin now a manuscript," "her exile no longer a punishment"), triggering the elevated Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "clarity that existed within the profound complexity" is restated as "seeing—truly seeing," then again as "the way light struck a window just so…in the simple act of seeing clearly what was always there." Template stems recur ("she understood now," "she recognized," "she would continue," "she would spend"). Stock metaphors ("hearts open enough," "eyes wide enough," "minds curious enough") cluster in the final third. Peak beats—the realization at the pond, the closing resolve—are dulled by synonym churn and scaffold. Figurative density without payoff lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles across adjacent lines: "bargained innocence" appears three times with slight rewording; "scarred/scars" and "cracked/crack/fracture" recur in near-adjacent beats without new pressure; "gentle/gently skilled" and "hard softness" are restated. Template-cadence runs: "He didn't need to find answers; he needed to..." and "he needed to enlighten not others, but himself" follow mechanical parallel stems. The final two paragraphs summarize the arc in overlapping terms ("translate," "honor," "understand," "resonant"). Figurative density in peak beats ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "velvet darkness pricked by distant lights," "dark vein against milky porcelain") blurs immediacy without taught pattern. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "logical dreamer" appears three times, "trial balloons" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "patterns" is reiterated without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("His hands moved," "His fingers trembled," "He felt," "He knew") across high-stakes beats. Mixed metaphors weaken clarity: "winds of potential futures," "soil of reality," and "weaving together decorum and disruption" lack coherent vehicle logic. Stock phrasing ("trembled," "in awe," "profound and undeniable") replaces concrete sensory detail. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("The passage had once been a grand hallway... now reclaimed" restates the opening's "ivy-veiled passage"), template cadence in early paragraphs ("Her motivation... her profession... her equipment"), and stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "with trembling hands," "made her breath catch"). The final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("legacy's burden" × 2, "dreams of walls" × 2) and tells rather than shows the thematic claim. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation: "she realized," "she recognized," "she understood." Clarity is maintained, but information density is low; several beats could compress. The paraphrase loop and template cadence in early beats, plus summary phrasing in the closure paragraph, disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops in adjacent paragraphs: "elusive mirage painter" and "The Painter" reintroduced; "borrowed heartbeat" concept repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]…, her [noun]…" stems recur. Stock metaphor: "spirit soared." Information density is moderate; several lines elaborate atmosphere without advancing plot. Figurative language ("prism caught her movements, fracturing her image") works cleanly at peak beats. Minus −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence; text-artifact screen applied once here.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images are concrete (ebony clipboard polished by thumb strokes, scuffed leather shoes, salt air). However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "the price of redemption" appears twice in near-identical phrasing; "flawed beauty" is repeated; multiple sentences open with "The" followed by abstract nouns ("The ceremony itself," "The ebony clipboard," "The price of redemption"). Stock metaphors proliferate ("collective memory of betrayal," "forever balance between war and uneasy truce"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final third without clear pattern-teaching, creating density that slows rather than propels. Information density is moderate but momentum sags under reflective weight in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear throughout: "The egg was his most prized possession…Silas had always been secretly sentimental" restates sentiment without advancement; "The salt flat shimmered…a fractured landscape…mirrored his own divided soul" mechanically cycles metaphor. Sentence stems repeat: "Silas [verb]" structures dominate without variation. Filter-verb stacks ("found his chest tightening," "understood that preserving") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The penultimate paragraph over-explains closure ("preserved something more important than life itself…preserved hope") rather than trusting the final image. Figurative density is high but metaphors occasionally contradict (fractured/perfect, silence/sound). Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence; artifacts touch the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn undermine density: "threads of fate" / "silvery strands" / "threads that bound her spirit" cycle without new information; "chaste courtesan" appears nine times, often in adjacent beats as a label rather than dramatized constraint. Template cadence runs ("The chaste courtesan had…" / "The courtesan's chastity…") across the final third (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes") lack specificity. Mixed metaphor: threads "sing" as they loosen, then Elara hears her "voice" as "thunder"—vehicles clash without earned payoff. Cumulative artifact debt in Q7: −1.4, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "uncommonly serene" appears six times, "half-lit epiphany" four times, "campfire story stick" nine times, "heated argument" three times—all without functional variation. Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]" opens fourteen sentences. The performance beat—the story's climax—is summarized in two sentences, a catastrophic elision of the moment that should carry weight. Figurative language is stock: "meteor hush," "pulse with potential." Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and templates, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch what should be the closure beat (the performance summary).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and image-rich, with strong sensory anchors (iridescent moth wing, orange-and-black monarchs, silken moon-flower threads). However, density occasionally tips into overwriting: "the increasingly inhospitable world below," "something precious had passed this way, something that deserved to be remembered," and the final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("weight of what was lost," "determination," "profound quiet," "broken and eternal") create mild redundancy. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("something precious" recurs twice in para 4). Template cadence is avoided, but elevated register is sustained even in peak beats where compression might serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentences are grammatically clean, and word choice is controlled. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (e.g., "street organ punched card scrap" anchors both backstory and present tool). However, stock phrases appear repeatedly: "snowmelt ardor" (twice), "technically gentle" (twice), "forgotten names" and variants (five times). Template cadence emerges in the final third with parallel "she had done it / she would stay / she knew" constructions. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but figurative language ("aurora painting," "shimmering column of living energy") tilts toward decorative in high-pressure beats without adding causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: paragraphs 7 and 13 both describe her condition as seeing only past/future, never present. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs with identical "The [noun]" or "As [noun]" sentence stems. Stock metaphors ("dissolving like sugar in water," "tiny spirits celebrating") replace concrete imagery at peak beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "began to transcend") stack in the closure sequence, dulling immediacy. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the storm/consciousness link without advancing pressure. The final third contains scaffold phrasing and synonym churn ("precisely playful" repeated without evolving function), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops damage momentum: "Between regimes" appears twice as a paragraph opener, "encrypted devotion" recurs without variation, and several beats restate the same content ("the tile's final secret" / "unlock the tile's power"). Figurative density is high without payoff—"dusky harmony," "cooled honey," "light like amethyst"—creating ornamental drag rather than propulsion. Pronoun "無數次" (Chinese characters) mid-paragraph is a generation artifact. Sentence openings are repetitive ("Anu [verb]," "The [noun]"), and the climax relies on vague gestures ("light engulfed," "something vast") instead of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across multiple beats: "the sanctuary's perfect stillness" / "the sanctuary's profound quiet" / "the sanctuary's ambient light" recycles stems without adding pressure. Stock metaphors ("dark aura," "shimmering light," "starlight given solid form") cluster in the closure beat, dulling the final image. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "appeared to") dull immediacy during high-pressure moments. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.2 for spread across closure) and loop check (−0.4) results in a score capped below mid-band. Clarity remains intact, preventing further collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence in the middle third: "The mirror maker smiled…" "The mirror maker's eyes closed…" "The mirror maker opened his eyes…" triggers −0.4. Paraphrase loops: "erasing boundaries" recurs four times without added pressure; "firmly grounded" appears twice as scaffold. Stock metaphors ("glass mountains caught in the sun's first rays," "luminous butterfly") accumulate without coherent vehicle logic. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or concept rather than advance action. The final paragraph summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing a closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor loops: "Deciduous vows flittered through her mind" echoes the final paragraph's thesis; "endearingly feisty" appears twice without fresh action. The final paragraph stacks elevated diction ("murmur its approval," "watered the seed with tears from both eyes") and delivers theme as summary rather than image, dulling momentum. Information density is adequate; no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences flatten momentum: "The pistachio shell cameo blank" appears identically across beats; "simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet" recur without variation; adjacent sentences restate concepts ("he'd never grown accustomed" / "particularly perplexing"). Figurative language is dense but often generic ("weight of collapsing stars," "bridge between temporal states"). The final third stacks declarations without propulsion: "would change not just his history but all histories" and similar cosmic summaries. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "appeared to") and scaffold transitions ("Back in," "Within the chamber") slow the line. Clarity remains intact but density is low; many sentences do only one job and that job is often decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold clutter appear throughout: "library of unlearned lessons" is repeated across four paragraphs without reweighting; "unheard symphony" opens and closes as bookend without causal work. Template cadence runs in the final third ("As they emerged," "As she returned," "forever changing and yet always waiting") flatten propulsion. Stock metaphors ("whispered their contents," "breathing as if in response") blur clarity. Figurative density in descriptive passages (ink entities as "floral and textual patterns," diary "glowing with soft green light") layered without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalties. Information density is low—many lines decorate rather than advance stakes or character.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but several phrases loop conceptually: "blissfully aberrant" appears twice, "trapped freedom" twice, and "narrative threads" recurs without evolving. Template cadence is evident in the final paragraph: "not just to find... but to give," "not just lost memories but a purpose." The metaphor of threads weaving is coherent but conventional. Information density is moderate; the middle section (tightrope walker, lovers) adds texture but does not advance the present conflict. No severe artifacts touch closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for loops and stem repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is high and information density is solid; each paragraph advances the mystery. However, the prose carries visible scaffolding: "According to" appears three times; "Eleanor" opens or anchors five consecutive paragraphs mid-story; multiple sentences begin with prepositional phrases in identical cadence. Template phrasing ("her characteristically warmly methodical approach," "her motivation crystallized") and synonym churn around "temporal" dull immediacy. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 in Q7, with additional cost for touching the closure paragraph ("her motivation crystallized").

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in the opening and Ice Sanctum sections. However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "gently luminous" recurs four times without evolution; "energy beings" is repeated mechanically across beats; and the pattern "The mapkeeper [verb]" opens five sentences in succession mid-story. Stock metaphors ("ripples on a pond," "seed of all harmony") dilute specificity. The final paragraph's thesis-like summary ("between every wave and ripple lies a silent point of potential") tells rather than trusts the image. Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and paragraphs vary in length, supporting visual rhythm. However, template cadence surfaces in repeated "She [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs, and paraphrase loops appear: "the shard of hush…the absence that spoke volumes, the gap between stars that held the secret" restates the same concept without added pressure. The phrase "thistle-blown hope" and "shard of hush" recur without evolving meaning. Stock metaphors ("threads connecting all moments," "witness") and elevated abstractions ("transformation," "possibility") cluster in the final third, dulling specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences describe rather than advance choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and atmospheric, with strong images (crystals absorbing sound, fog solidified into structures, shadows as celestial signatures). However, the piece loops thematically across adjacent paragraphs: "People forget...but here, the memories persist" / "capture what we have been" / "ensure...memories...would never truly be lost" restates the same content without added pressure. Scaffold phrases—"his preemptively nostalgic nature," "the archivist," "deepening hush"—recur as placeholders. Filter verbs ("felt his purpose crystallize," "understood why") dull immediacy in the final third. Grammar and spatial logic are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "One by one," "As the last vestiges," "Below him," "When the final ember." The opening employs stacked modifiers ("massive stone walls, overgrown with night-blooming cereus and moonflowers") and the climax leans on figurative catalog ("purple that sang, green that whispered, gold that danced") without grounding the synesthesia in Elias's specific craft knowledge. Two paraphrase loops: paragraph three's "serious playfulness" is label-restated in paragraph five as "playful seriousness," and the final paragraph's "gravity of hopelessness had been defied" echoes the opening's phrasing nearly verbatim. Filter-verb reliance is light. No major clarity breaks, but template cadence in the climax paragraph ("he lit," "he activated," "the colors that burst forth") flattens propulsion during the story's peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops pervade the text: "transition periods" and "texture of time" recur in five separate paragraphs with minimal variation, and the jade cicada's warmth/pulse is restated three times in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is visible in repeated sentence stems: "The jade cicada [verb]..." appears four times. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "realized") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Information density is low; many sentences restate the theme without advancing situation or choice. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple paragraphs in closure third = baseline −1.2, touching closure = −1.7 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose carries several paraphrase loops: "silence that tasted simultaneously of honey and light, something intangibly tangible yet impossible to contain" restates the same idea without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the altitude-sampling sequence ("first...then...each"). Stock phrasing ("siren song," "seedling about to sprout," "wash over her") recurs in pivotal beats. Mixed metaphor: "sprout new awareness" while "her body remained solid" creates a confused vehicle. Rhythm is often sluggish with stacked modifiers and filter verbs ("she felt the familiar stretching contracted feeling"). Information density is moderate; many sentences do two jobs, but scaffold remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.9)
    **Patterned-artifact penalty pack:** Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third—"monitoring noise levels" recurs without added detail; "drifting prism terrace" and "vaulting hush" are synonym-churned across adjacent lines. Template cadence: runs of "Elias [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across seven consecutive paragraphs without variation. Filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats ("began to relax," "felt a satisfaction," "knowing that"), dulling immediacy. Stock metaphors: "storm glass vial shimmered slightly," "landscape for healing." Baseline **−1.2** in Q7 for spread; artifacts touch the penultimate paragraph, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and varied in structure, with no major loops or artifacts. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty describing world and action. However, several beats lean on stock phrasing: "breathtaking," "fascinated scholars and dreamers for centuries," "her motivation burning brighter." The phrase "dissolved politely" is tonally jarring. The final paragraph stacks multiple summary claims ("countless challenges and betrayals," "renewed hope," "beautifully fragmented world") that tell rather than show. Propulsion is steady but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several adjacent sentences in paragraphs 4–5 loop conceptually: "Each scar was a story... all healing only when shared" followed immediately by "If she abandoned her duty, the fading threshold would disappear" restates stakes without added pressure. The elevated diction ("loaded emptiness," "crucible of shared suffering") in peak beats creates minor register drift from the earlier concrete details. The three-knock sequence is clean and propulsive. No major artifact clusters, but the recurring abstract phrasing ("tender shadow keeper" appears three times) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence damage momentum. Lines 2–3 restate the farm's ambiance without added pressure. Lines 7–8 loop the scam-dismissal without advancing knowledge. The bolt's discovery (lines 22–25) recycles "exactly as described," "vibrate with energy," "thrumming through her hand" in adjacent beats. Figurative language clusters heavily without payoff: "silent song," "shadowseam wonder," "quantum redemption." Stock metaphors ("tears to her eyes," "ashes of her past") appear in the climax. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the artifact cap, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade the text: "eloquently silent" is repeated identically across three beats; "golden shadows" and "first yawn of evening" recur as stock phrases without variation. Paragraph structure is uniform, with most paragraphs opening with "The [noun]" or "He [verb]" stems. Information density is low: many sentences restate prior content ("The dynasty ender positioned the gramophone" / "With careful precision, he began to turn the crank handle"). The closure beat itself loops: "the dynasty would end" is stated, then restated two lines later as "the dynasty ender held the document that would finally end centuries of deception."

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports atmospheric accumulation. Template-cadence slip: "The program contained diagrams... These were not mere puppet-show instructions but rather..." and "This was no ordinary theatrical guide but a key..." recycle the corrective "not X but Y" stem within two paragraphs, applying −0.4 per the loop check. Figurative density is high ("tiny spirits," "impossible colors," "transparent pages") but remains legible. Information density is moderate; several lines restate mystical awe without advancing causality. Clarity is clean; no pronoun or tense confusion. The combination of template cadence and synonym churn in mystical descriptors ("ethereal," "transcendent," "immaterial") keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and good paragraph rhythm. However, template cadence appears: "She found solace... She gently adjusted... She carefully removed... She wondered... She smiled." The typo "unfurred" (should be "unfurled") and "unexamined unknowns" redundancy in the penultimate paragraph are artifacts. Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate—some lines do double duty (dust patterns + grief), but reflective passages summarize rather than compress. Loop check: "unknown histories" and "unknowns" recur without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage density: "reappear" echoes across the text without evolving meaning, "carefully resourceful" / "practiced ease" / "practiced efficiency" recycle the same trait-label, and the final two paragraphs restate closure consequences in overlapping phrases ("crack in their wall," "foundation for rebuilding," "world was ready to see again"). Template cadence is present in the closing beats ("When they find us," "When plans unraveled," "The lagoon would keep"). Some metaphors are strained—"fog" of indifference, "ripples" as both literal water and abstract symbol. Grammar and tense are clean. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job only.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops drag momentum: "quietly vivid" appears three times, "eerie nostalgia" twice, "vested hush" thrice; "as dewdrops formed" bookends without reweighting. Sentences in paragraphs 18–21 open with "The" or "Ethan's" in monotonous succession. Stock metaphors ("victory settling over him like the lingering mist") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hold," "could feel") in high-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Clarity is intact but density and propulsion suffer under ornamental repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is generally clear and vivid with varied syntax. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Her [noun]" and "Elara [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "always emerges transformed" / "each year becoming more attuned" / "always emerges transformed always" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.4). "Mossy delight" and "hush where past meets prophecy" repeat as labels without evolving meaning. Information density is moderate; several lines describe process without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and information density is adequate in the discovery and descent sequences. However, paraphrase loops appear: "perhaps some things weren't meant to be perfectly predictable" / "embracing the unpredictable nature of time"; "Elias became uncertainly certain" / "uncertainly" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the underground chamber: "They didn't tell perfect time, but they told time... They didn't tell perfect time, but..." The final three paragraphs summarize outcomes rather than showing them, flattening momentum. Figurative language ("shadow that followed him," "dance with chaos") tilts stock in peak beats. Scaffold phrases like "From that day forward" and "had learned that" mark retrospective telling.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template stems appear frequently: "rain-washed" recurs six times, often in identical constructions ("rain-washed foundry," "rain-washed hands," "rain-washed surfaces"). Adjacent lines restate without added pressure ("He had explored the limits of his craft and found something more valuable... wisdom forged in failure"). Stock metaphor strings ("steam rising... like a ghostly sigh," "balance of cosmic forces") dull immediacy. Some lines do double work (tool use + internal state), but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than propels. Apply −0.8 for loops/stems and figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Rhythm varies and momentum is maintained through the pursuit. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "luminous ache" recurs three times; "spectral confession" and variants cycle without added meaning; "hidden sunrise" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence is mild ("his pockets heavy…his heart laden"). Information density is moderate; no major scaffold, but figurative language leans generic in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("copper taste of fear," "shards of glass"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 9–10 restate "allowing the forest's atmosphere to seep" and "ultraviolet penance where everything hidden would be revealed"; paragraphs 16–17 repeat the forest-as-participant idea. Template cadence in the mid-section (repeated "His [noun] [verb]" stems) and a cluster of filter verbs in peak memory beats ("seemed to," "felt like") dull immediacy. The stock metaphor "drowning creature breaking water" and elevated register ("proprioceptively enhanced senses mapping") clash slightly with urgency. Deductions total approximately −1.0 for loops and templates, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "elusively tangible" appears three times with synonym churn ("seeming to shift between solidity and vapor," "difficult to study, yet impossible to ignore," "no longer elusively tangible but fully present"). Template cadence runs through the final third with repeated "As" and "The" stems across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors ("colors swirl and merge," "constellations in a night sky") and abstraction ("anchors of intuition humming") dull clarity at peak beats. Applying −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template artifacts; additionally −0.3 for figurative density without payoff in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the setup (elevator tech, ghost sight, dust patterns, horologist legend compressed efficiently). Paraphrase loops appear: "the space between worlds" is restated across paragraphs, and "weightless burden" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "Marcus + [verb]" or "The + [noun]." The final two paragraphs pile figurative language (heat waves, music box, heartbeat cleaving) and declare rather than show the closure effect. Filter-verb stack in one passage ("Marcus knew...understood...believed") dulls immediacy. Clarity is maintained, but scaffold and summary blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The glass orchard library floated silently" / "This architectural marvel had survived" restate setting without advancement. Template cadence runs across beats: "His fingers...trembled" / "The library responded" / "Eldon began preparing" stack without variation. Stock metaphors cluster: "golden leaves in an autumn storm," "morning dew," "rustling with awakenings." The rupture beat—pivotal moment—summarizes rather than dramatizes ("began to crack branch by branch, but rather than shattering, it translucently reformed"). Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("noticed the glass walls beginning to warp," "watched in awe"). Multiple artifacts touch closure (final paragraph summary), triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary somewhat, but several beats recycle stems: "Elias had…" (twice), "The crystal vase shard…" (twice across paragraphs), "He began/wrote/had" cluster in adjacent lines. Stock phrases appear without character specificity: "old passion," "burnished sorrow," "lost causes and abandoned dreams," "growing astonishment." The writing scene summarizes the manuscript's creation ("He began to write… letters appeared… he wrote") rather than dramatizing a micro-choice or revision that reveals hierarchy of values. Figurative language is dense without clear pattern-teaching or payoff: "visible Time might peer back," "floating moments," "river-like flow" stack metaphors for time without a single controlling vehicle. No major loops or causality breaks, but momentum drags in the middle third with repeated restatements of the plan and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries lyric ambition but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The chip from the philosopher's stone" appears as sentence subject five times, often restating its glow/pulse without advancing pressure. Metaphor density is high yet several vehicles are generic ("like perfume," "like a violet in shadow," "like dawn chasing away night"). The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("mending what wasn't torn," "reclaimed light," "enemy of silence") rather than closing with image. Stock phrasing ("hungered for melody," "woven from dreams and starlight") undercuts specificity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear but carries artifactual weight: paraphrase loops ("the boundary between rational understanding and something greater" / "the place where explanations fail"), template stems ("something primal," "something ancient," "something fundamental"), and stock metaphors (obsidian surface, stars that would never reach it). The three "hinged awakenings" are numbered and declared rather than woven through image, dulling momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to emanate," "felt in her bones") cluster in the lagoon beat without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and prompt-label repetition pervade the text: "timewoven alliances" appears six times, "turbine-hum reverie" four times, "spirited driftwood sculptor" three times, often in identical syntactic slots. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [gerund] the [noun]" runs across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("storm-tossed," "vast tapestry of time") and thesis-essay phrasing ("testament to," "manifestation of," "embodying the") flatten momentum. The final five paragraphs recycle "timewoven alliances" and "perpetually learning" as synonym churn rather than advancing pressure. Artifacts appear throughout, including the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every paragraph deploys figurative language ("leaves danced outside like scattered embers," "dust motes in the air like suspended stars"), creating density without proportional information gain. Template cadence appears in repetitive "The X" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "soul, quiet and profound as the first snowfall") flatten peak beats. Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 16–18 restate the glass-transforms-light insight three times without advancing pressure. High-pressure beats (cathedral discovery) carry the same ornamental texture as transit paragraphs, dulling propulsion. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap Q7 per the penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template-cadence runs pervade: "Dr. Ellara Vance traced…," "After the letters were found…," "To uncover truth…," "Opening the seventh volume…," "Now retrocognitively trapped…," "The searing reverie…," "On the zeppelin's viewing deck…" (seven consecutive paragraph openers follow noun-phrase + predicate without variation, triggering −0.6). Paraphrase loops cluster: paragraphs two/three both establish "the archive drifted" / "the zeppelin sailed"; paragraphs nine/ten repeat "her blood called" / "passions and pains." Stock metaphors: "floating library," "truth in tension," "searing reverie." Figurative density in non-peak beats: "chromatic memories," "resurrected heart," "profound light and shadow." Combined artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is low; many sentences restate setup without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; sentences are grammatically clean and information flows logically. However, pervasive scaffold and synonym loops reduce density: "students and colleagues had filled these crumbling streets, but they had all deserted their craft" / "others had been waiting for precisely this invitation to reimagine their world" echoes the same conceptual ground without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in runs of "Elior [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Figurative language is sparse but mixed: "beating heart of true community" is stock; "amber bottle with no opening" is concrete and purposeful. Paraphrase loops (e.g., paragraphs restating that wishes brought infrastructure but not spirit) and thematic summary in the final third trigger −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle: "no longer content with just archiving words, he now sought to capture the emotional patterns" is restated as "preserve not just the oath words any longer, but the emotional patterns." Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "Elias knew that… / Elias wondered if… / Elias made his way…" across the final third, triggering −0.4 to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("whisper of history," "essence of the speaker's soul," "impending darkness") lack fresh vehicle. The final paragraph stacks summary rather than propelling through image: "his duty… had evolved… archaeologist… keeper… most sacred task… preserving." Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job but lack compression or layered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries figurative density throughout—"dancing shadows," "captured fireflies in a universe of contained possibilities," "inverted tree seeking its roots"—without always advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 3 tells us the egg changed everything (connection, understanding, purpose), then paragraph 4 repeats the change as seeking to reopen inheritance. Template cadence recurs with stacked paradoxes (furious tranquility, wild serenity, chaos/calm, substance/transparency) in high-pressure beats, creating a drumbeat rhythm rather than varied propulsion. The final two paragraphs compress the vortex manifestation and Anya's realization into back-to-back abstractions ("texture of borrowed time," "bridge between preservation and experience") that summarize rather than dramatize the closure moment. Cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loop, template cadence in peak beats, figurative density without momentum payoff): −1.2 in Q7, with additional impact from abstraction at closure pushing toward the lower 5-band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in technical beats (glue repairs, barometric tracking, solstice alignment). However, several beats carry paraphrase loops: "weathered fingers along its fibers, testing their strength" echoes "ran...fingers...testing," and the theme of listening/subtlety is restated across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Template cadence appears in explanatory asides ("Unlike other technicians...," "His colleagues called him...," "His method...had become..."). Figurative language ("tongue sensitive," "dance of weather systems," "mountain-splitting storms") is frequent but mostly functional. The closure image is clean but the final paragraph over-explains ("if only someone would listen").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with no major loops or causality-breaking artifacts. However, several beats engage in paraphrase loops: the transformation sequence recycles "cosmic consciousness," "interconnection," and "vulnerability" across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template stems appear in the resolution ("He saw how…how…," "The cosmic janitor had discovered…"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence in the void sequence stacks metaphor ("primal elegance," "rebirthing in patterns," "grand tapestry") that blurs concrete action. The clarity at closure survives but momentum sags under decorative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "through contextual clues" (3×), "astonished recluse" (4×), "weight of unspoken words" (3×), and "tangled covenant" recur without evolving function. Sentence stems repeat: "The astonished recluse…" opens multiple paragraphs; "They [verb]" and "One [time]…" dominate. Stock metaphors ("smoke in the desert wind," "moon-bleached air") and elevated register ("mute eloquence," "transcended mere pollination") flatten voice. Figurative density in non-peak beats (prismatic shadows, ethereal figures, impossible colors) clutters without advancing pressure. Final-third artifacts touching closure trigger −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "understand the texture of time passing" repeats across paragraphs; "borrowed-time timekeeper" appears in opener, midpoint, and close without reweighting. Template cadence dominates: "She was becoming...," "She was not merely...," "She knew there would be..." in the final third. Stock metaphors ("beacon against the washed-out sky," "key turns," "tapestry") lack fresh synthesis. The final paragraph is a scaffold summary that recaps theme and stake rather than dramatizing closure. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ rule and cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines throughout: paragraphs 5-6 restate "harmonizing discord" in three ways without added pressure; paragraphs 16-17 recycle "words flowing freely" and "inspiration flooding." Template cadence pervades: "Her journal lay...Her poetry often...Her motivation was" and "The poet paused...The poet smiled...The poet felt." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh synthesis: "stones skipped across water," "dam holding back inspiration," "bridge between realms." These artifacts touch multiple beats including near-closure, triggering −1.7 baseline in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high; no causality breaks. However, template cadence is pervasive: "The [noun]" opens numerous consecutive sentences, and many paragraphs begin with time markers or subject restatements without variation ("Elias," "The island caretaker," "The copper wire"). Paraphrase loops appear: "architectural secrets" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure; "copper wire wrapped around oak branches" recurs verbatim as a label. Figurative language ("symphony of light and growth," "bridge between worlds") clusters in the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed metaphors (pillars "breathe," wire "sings," light "pulses") stack without coherent vehicle logic. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "almost") appear frequently. Apply −1.2 for template cadence + loops + late figurative density touching closure, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence mar momentum: "artificial pilgrimage" appears five times, "luminous skeptic" three times, "bronze quiet" three times, "chemistry of homecoming" five times, all with minimal variation. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague: "bronze quiet" as both visual and sonic metaphor, "fly amber seemed to pulse…as if the ancient fly was somehow communicating" without causal grounding. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("The tower's bronze…," "Elian's…," "The fly amber…"). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "a promise in his wake" echoes "hope speaking to the waiting soil"; "renewing reef" repeats "submerged concord was restored" within two sentences. Stock metaphors abound ("dying sun," "fragile embrace," "wounded world"). The phrase "ttk duelersi" appears mid-sentence as a typographic artifact, unacknowledged. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The + noun" or "From his coat, he…" Figurative density in the opening (gloom-hill, windswept, dying sun, long shadows, barren landscape within 25 words) frontloads mood without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "The message spoke of a place beyond the wasteland" followed immediately by "Silas understood now what he must do to translate distance into closeness" without added pressure (−0.2). Several near-duplicates ("wild hush" recurs four times with identical phrasing; "tinted revelations" appears three times as a label without evolving meaning) create template cadence (−0.4). Stock metaphor "grooves like they were scent trails" is functional but not transformative. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance setting or atmosphere without pushing conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: paragraphs 2–4 restate "blessed pariah/gift and curse" without added pressure; paragraphs 10–11 recycle "keeper of memories/bridge between what was and what could be." Template cadence runs appear in consecutive subject-verb openings and recycled stems ("She was," "Her motivation," "The compass rose"). Stock metaphors cluster without concrete grounding: "plunged civilization into uncertainty," "scattered humanity to the winds," "beacon of hope." Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations dull immediacy: "allowing herself a glimpse," "the pull of purpose," "the weight of responsibility." The final beat restates the opening's "blessed pariah" frame without fresh density.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "embrace the unknown with open arms, wherever it might lead him" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template cadence runs through the chess-piece sequence ("Kael placed...watching as," "swapped...the altar slid aside," "placed...a section retracted"). Stock phrases ("otherworldly blue light," "newfound determination") pad without specificity. The final paragraph summarizes emotional resolution ("The balance is restored") rather than trusting the image. Figurative language ("hand-carved chess pieces...time itself bent and twisted") mixes vehicles without coherent logic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence undermine propulsion: "She first encountered it… so she knew its manifestations" restates rather than advances; "Before the Crisis… Now she used that understanding" mechanically toggles time without density. Stock phrases ("gathering gloom," "tiny beacon," "relentless work of remembering") cluster in high-pressure beats, flattening texture. The two errant Chinese sentences followed by immediate English correction—"Elara最后看着棋盘，心中明白…" then "[回注：这是中文，需要修正]" then the corrected version—are severe generation artifacts that disrupt the closure paragraph. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to pulse") dull immediacy. Multiple scaffold sentences ("For now… But tonight… Somewhere…") loop without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and free of major mechanical errors, with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, multiple passages recycle phrasing: "lost language stone" appears with identical descriptors across beats; "hidden thunder" is repeated without evolving meaning; "shape of home" becomes a refrain that substitutes for concrete stakes. The final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops—"home wasn't a place" is restated three different ways within eight lines. Figurative language in high-pressure moments (the climax) tends toward stock metaphor: "pure light," "tapestry woven with threads," "volumes of possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "woven hush" appears in five separate sentences with minimal variation, and "productive fidgeting" is restated three times without added detail. Template cadence appears in multiple "His fingers…" and "The [noun] had…" sentence stems across the piece. Several beats stack filter verbs ("began," "felt," "seemed") where directness would sharpen. Mixed metaphors appear: walls "shimmer like liquid metal" yet also form a door "invisible to all but someone who understood," blurring the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn accumulate: "challenge—like art daring convention," "refract a single truth / refract for others / refracted it into endless echoes." Template cadence appears in stacked participial openers ("As a rebellious artist," "As the day approached"). Stock metaphors ("truth as light") and abstract philosophizing replace concrete embodiment. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image and action, flattening momentum at closure. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without sustained pattern or payoff: "diviner reading bones," "foggy veil," "quilted memories," "patching the frayed tapestry," "timeless space between breaths held underwater," "reality softened like heated wax," "memory became as tangible as the tools," "magnetic insistence," "dire enchantment," "golden joining of fragments." Multiple metaphors compete within single beats without coherence. Paraphrase loops: "uncertainty had been his constant companion" followed by "foggy veil obscuring the boundary between what he knew and what he desperately sought to understand." Template cadence: "His purpose was singular…his driving motivation…" Elevated register ("liminal," "metaphysical," "meticulously") clashes with the POV's hands-on alchemist work. Filter-verb stack in the breath-holding passage ("closed his eyes," "held his breath," "willing himself") dulls immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clarity and sensory specificity are strong; sentences carry purposeful detail. Rhythm varies in peak beats but exposition runs lean on syntactic variety: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias" or "The [noun]" in template fashion. Paraphrase loops appear ("It was unmistakably his own… unmistakably his work") and conceptual redundancy in adjacent lines ("The concept consumed him… temporary eternity… like footprints in sand or love's first blush"). No mixed metaphors or serious opacity. The scaffold and synonym churn cumulatively impose −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat but spread across the middle third. Information density is high; momentum is steady without major loops.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops reduce density: "tears of screaming tenderness welling in his eyes, connecting with his sister across oceans through nothing more than purified whispers" restates the prior paragraph's content. Template cadence appears in "He discovered...He planned...Closing his eyes, Elias whispered...Then he moved...He plucked...Holding the vial, Elias thought..." Stock metaphors ("dawn painted the horizon in shades of peach and lavender," "protective aura") appear without fresh inflection. The phrase "screaming tenderness" is recycled three times without evolving meaning, and "pure intent" / "purified intentions" / "vibrations of pure intent" cycle synonymously across the text. Figurative language density is high in the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, lowering propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "fluctuates with moon phases" appears verbatim twice; "geography of loss" is repeated without reweighting; "reverse migration" is stated three times across the text. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("worked alone," "fingers tracing," "after the hydraulics failed") and middle sections with repetitive "the navigator [verb]" stems (−0.8 for loops and template stems touching multiple beats). Figurative language is stock: "silver thread," "bridge between tides," "ghosts of past journeys." Sentence rhythm varies adequately, and clarity is maintained, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several text-pattern issues weaken propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 4 and 5 both restate the virus's effect on emotional boundaries and truthfulness. The middle third stacks exposition (virus timeline, textbook background, Dr. Finch's reputation) without advancing present action. Stock phrasing surfaces ("profound stillness," "mixture of release and exhaustion," "broken and beautiful"). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The" or "Elara" + past-tense verb, flattening rhythm. Final-paragraph summary ("understood," "realized," "knowing," "turned her steps") tells rather than shows the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and strong opening/closing images. Minor template cadence in the borrowed-memory sequence ("images appeared: a woman's laughter… the sharp scent… the taste of…") and one paraphrase loop ("These memories arrived without invitation, fragments of another life" echoes the prior sentence's structure). "Shelfs" is a typo for "shelves." Information density is solid; no major loops or scaffolding obscure causality, but figurative language occasionally clusters without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (e.g., ants as both guide and symbol). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "lonely antique map dealer" recurs in opening and near-closing; "doorway of decisions" is repeated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. The closure beat uses abstract intensifiers ("glimmer...of possibilities realigned," "blinding...of light but of possibilities") that reduce concreteness. Template cadence is minimal; no major artifact stacks obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs: "disenchanted monarch...seeking meaning," "not the kind...but a deeper connection," "not been a threat...but a promise." Figurative language clusters without pattern payoff ("lacy menace," "bleeding starlight," "liquid sapphire"). Filter-verb stack in reflection pool paragraph ("felt drawn," "seemed almost alive"). Sentence openings vary, but information density is low—many lines restate rather than advance. Mid-band ceiling due to loop/scaffold presence and figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and carries atmosphere, but suffers from pervasive label-stacks and paraphrase loops: "scientifically romantic" appears three times without dramatization, "density of presence" and "palette of resolve" recur as abstract placeholders, and adjacent sentences often restate concepts (e.g., "revalue," "revolutionize," "completely transform"). Template cadence runs through several beats ("No longer content to…she now wanted to…"). Figurative language is dense but sometimes contradicts itself ("twilight deepening and brightening simultaneously"). The loop/scaffold issues span multiple paragraphs and dull momentum, applying −0.8 in Q7 with an additional −0.3 for filter-verb reliance in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies but several figurative phrases cluster densely without payoff: "dance between dreaming and waking," "fractured corridors of his own timeline," "cosmic storyteller." Mixed metaphor: "boundaries blurring until cabin walls became transparent" then "soar…through fractured corridors" mixes spatial logic. Template stems appear: "He envied them sometimes…Getting jealous of past selves had become…" rephrases the same idea. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "past selves whispered" then "these younger versions who still believed" restates envy without added pressure. Stock phrasing: "terrifying beauty," "perfect clarity." Deductions: density −0.5, coherence −0.4, paraphrase −0.2, stock metaphor −0.3; total −1.4 in Q7. No artifacts touch closure beat directly, so global 9+ disqualification does not apply, but accumulated debt prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm; sentences vary in structure and the water-clock drips create auditory cadence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "once breathed the world through scents" followed immediately by enumeration of scents; "the hush of morning fog wrapped around her shop as she turned the brass handle" then "stepping into a space filled with mechanisms." Stock metaphors cluster ("morning mist," "vessels of human stories") without fresh embodiment. The closure beat remains unobscured, capping deductions, but density could tighten throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean with purposeful imagery (crow quill, luminescent ink, crystallization prickle). However, loops appear: "scars transformed into stories" recurs without rephrasing, and the storm's approach is mentioned three times with similar phrasing ("next tempest," "approaching storm," "storm broke"). Sentence openings show some variety, but several paragraphs begin with "The" or "Elara" in close succession. No major opacity, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins," "Time tiptoes on broken glass," "energy could scatter like startled birds," "like a memory with weight." While individually vivid, the concentration of metaphor in nearly every sentence—especially during high-pressure beats (the summoning)—tilts toward overwriting without all vehicles earning their cost; some feel ornamental rather than functionally constraining choice. Minor scaffold appears: "The aroma—Beatrice's signature blend of jasmine and regret—was the key" restates what the prior sentence already implied. Sentence openings vary and information density is generally strong, but the figurative load in peak moments slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.7)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "resounding hush" appears five times, "spiral arbitration" four times, "journeying inward while walking out" three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "The [noun] [verb]…" structures dominate. Paraphrase loops recur (paragraphs 6–7 restate wanderingly exact path). Filter-verb stacks ("began to solidify," "seemed to meander") dull immediacy. Figurative density ("threads of light older than time," "pure consciousness suspended in infinite potential") stacks without clear payoff, triggering −0.9 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "what clocks really measure" recurs three times without added pressure; "eminently peculiar" is planted mechanically across paragraphs. Template cadence in the counting sequence ("One. The horizon…Two. The shepherd…Three. Through counting") reads decorative rather than propulsive. "The hydra" fragment at story's end is an unresolved typo or artifact. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("neither beginning nor end, much like the tides") during peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines do single jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops appear: "patterns she'd never noticed before—patterns that seemed to align" and the repeated "lucid contradictions" framing. Template cadence shows in "Unlike her father, who saw... Elena was theoretically rebellious" constructions. Stock metaphors like "irony followed her like a personal shadow" and "drug and a poison simultaneously" flatten texture. The final paragraph loops "traverse" and "clover melancholy" without new pressure. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance multiple jobs, but scaffold sentences about her mission and approach dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences mar momentum: "Between the hum of streetlamps" repeats as a stem five times; "melodically haunted" and "glass harmonica disc" recur as synonym-churn anchors without added information. The final third stacks expository summary ("His cultivated estrangement had become...," "The subway utility tunnel, once a prison, now felt...") that restates theme rather than advancing image or action. Stock metaphors ("fortress of solitude," "loop," "sanctuary") appear without fresh particulars. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple beats, baseline −0.8; artifacts touch the closure summary, escalating to −1.2 total in Q7. Additionally, the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful detail and varied sentence rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The haunted euphoria intensified" / "The haunted euphoria remained"; "steep documents in a solution" / "dipped his brush...letting it steep"; "blooming jetty" recurs seven times without functional variation. Template cadence is visible in repeated "as" constructions across adjacent sentences ("As he opened," "As he mixed," "As the last stroke fell," "As twilight surrendered"). Stock metaphor "winds of change" appears without transformation. Information density is moderate; some beats do double work (locket warming + memory acknowledgment) but others rehearse the same emotional note (euphoria, preservation philosophy) without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "His laugh echoed" / "his voice cracking" / "his briefcase clutched"; "The first taxi" / "Fifteen minutes later" / "Three days later" / "By week's end" creates a mechanical time-stamp pattern. Figurative language is sparse. Some scaffolding remains: "such was the paradoxical reciprocity that defined his existence" tells rather than dramatizes. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The montage structure compresses transit efficiently but also flattens momentum in the middle third. No severe opacity, but rhythm is sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, the piece exhibits pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold: "the hidden stillpoint" appears in nearly every paragraph with synonym churn ("stillpoint he sought," "the stillpoint's secrets," "hidden stillpoint," "internal compass"), and many adjacent sentences restate the same idea ("The melody now sang of grief and acceptance, of loss and discovery, of blindness as a different way of seeing" is followed by a sentence that restates transformation). Template cadence ("of X and Y, of A and B") recurs across multiple beats without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("quiet blaze") are invoked repeatedly without fresh embodiment. These artifacts dull the closure image and accumulate to approximately −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "confidently uncertain" recurs without added pressure (paragraph 6, then 32); "strange comfort" is stated twice in similar frames (paragraph 19, then final). Template cadence is mild but present ("She was," "She spent," "She dipped," "She knew"). Stock metaphor "rabbit hole" and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("thresh meaning from experience") lower precision. The chronopaper beat is clear, but surrounding exposition (paragraphs 10–13 summarize backstory and theory) stalls momentum. Information density is uneven; the opening third front-loads setup rather than weaving it through action. No severe artifact touches closure, limiting deduction, but cumulative drag prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence pervades: "Elias [verb]" opens seven sentences, "The vintage camera [verb]" repeats thrice, and synonym loops appear ("mapping silence," "translate silence," "map her sorrow"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third, restating that Elias translates silence without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "invisible threads" and "notes hanging in the air" blur into generic metaphor. Information density is low; many sentences restate the premise rather than advancing it. The −0.6 to −1.4 artifact penalty applies here with an additional −0.3 for late-third template runs, totaling approximately −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "faded tapestry fragment" appears six times with minimal variation; "volcanic tenderness" recurs identically in three beats. Template cadence: "Maya's [noun] [verb]" opens five sentences within three paragraphs. Synonym churn: "dusty halls echoing," "underground sanctuary," "vast archive" restate setting without added detail. The closure paragraph contains two adjacent sentences restating the same redemption theme. Stock metaphors ("bridge between destruction and renewal") in the final third disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative artifact penalties totaling −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose exhibits several loops and template cadences: "the quiet rebellion" recurs without variation, "auroral sorrow" is invoked three times in similar phrasing, and sentence stems repeat ("Elena knew," "the doctors," "the sound wave"). Mixed metaphors appear: the universe "inhaling" and "exhaling" is poetic but the lagoon "responding to emotions" and "painting memories" stacks vehicles without coherent tenor. Information density is uneven—long wind-up on backstory (Theo's disappearance, neural entanglement mechanics) compresses the escape sequence into summary beats. Figurative language in most sentences of the climax (swirling motes, liquid light, translucent form, aurora colors) without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("as long as their entangled memories persisted," "a sanctuary built not of matter but of defiance and love") rather than closing on image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is functional and clear but carries pattern artifacts: "Marlo slipped… Marlo smiled… Marlo merely shrugged… Marlo added…" recurs across beats. Stock constructions appear ("uncanny ability," "arcane ritual," "phantom workers"). The geomagnetic storm is mentioned six times across the text, often in similar phrasing. Paraphrase loops: "whispers could travel unimpeded for astonishing distances" / "the acoustics would carry his voice farther than Vance's shouts" / "whispered directions had accomplished what shouts never could." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the night's end.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence dominates: "Each step was measured, each movement flowing"; "Opening some, closing others, adjusting angles"; "Cobalt mixed with gold and silver"; "trust, history, perhaps even the fate of the canal." Paraphrase loops recur—paragraphs 7, 13, 22, and 25 all restate "teaching darkness the value of stars" without advancing pressure. The phrases "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret," and "silent empathy" each appear 3+ times, often in similar syntactic slots, creating synonym churn and conceptual redundancy. Peak beats (the visitor's approach, the final shutter click) are narrated in the same elevated register, dulling urgency. These artifacts pervade the piece, including the closure paragraph, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and global 9+ disqualification. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or spatial errors. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "confusion, constraint, and cries for freedom" / "Why must we do everything this way?" restate the same idea; "small crystal that glowed with captured starlight" is repeated across beats without new information. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Arthur [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation. Stock phrases: "sentinel against the twilight," "dance of precision and secrecy," "beautiful chaos of human creativity." These artifacts dull momentum and accumulate to approximately −1.0 in this category. The final third contains heavy telling—"something new had been planted"—that summarizes rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, several template cadence runs appear: "One evening...The moment...For generations...The next dawn...Days passed...Then came..." creates a list-like rhythm across sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh angle: "battlefield of hope and fear," "doors she had never realized were firmly guarded," "weight...slipping away." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 14–15 ("felt barriers...felt the weight") dulls immediacy at a peak beat. "Salt sugar" is a mixed vehicle (salt dissolves; sugar dissolves; the pairing adds no specificity). Apply −0.8 for template cadence and stock metaphor strings, plus −0.3 for the filter cluster, totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery ("sliced the sky into rhythmic sections," "brittle petal… flakes fall like snow"). However, several passages display template cadence and paraphrase loops: "cultivate lightness in grief" / "lightness that loss has eroded," and "enforced sincerity" / "enforced joy" / "manufactured contentment" recycle similar concepts without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks multiple thematic summaries ("remade hush," "quiet revolution," "forgiveness") that feel like scaffolding rather than image. Sentence structure varies well overall, but the theatrical monologue sections lean on repetitive "This [object/action]" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The poet approached slowly... The poet felt... The poet closed their eyes... The poet smiled... The poet took a deep breath..." runs across the entire piece with identical stems. Register remains elevated but consistent. Figurative language ("cloud-shadow," "lantern-moth hush," "tremor of certainty") recurs as atmospheric tokens without accumulating new meaning. The final third contains heavy summary and thematic assertion ("They would return... not as they had left it, but as a bridge") that flattens momentum. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and −0.4 for loops touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph-long sentences with nested relative clauses create density but also momentum drag, especially in the opening two paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "bartered awakenings" appears three times in adjacent beats without varied function. "Innocently cunning" recurs as unanchored label. Stock phrasing: "the ability to find beauty in imperfection," "silent language speaking volumes." Figurative language is elevated but sometimes muddy ("botanical dialogues shaped the very air"). Information density is moderate; several sentences restate stakes without advancing them. No artifact touches the closure image directly, capping deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "prism-song bell ringer" appears seven times, "artificial pilgrimage" five times, "texture of connection" four times, "powerfully gentle" three times, "golden shadows" recurs without functional shift. Sentences follow repetitive stem patterns ("The prism-song bell ringer [verb]..." × 4 instances; "There were still so many [noun] to [verb]..." closes with a list). Figurative density is high without payoff—"cathedral of resonance," "tapestry of human experience," "tiny spirits"—muddling clarity in what should be a moment of discovery. Applying −1.4 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and stock metaphor strings across multiple beats; final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "genuinely artificial—crafted from metals and stones rather than organic matter" restates the modifier; "subdued ardor—a quiet passion" immediately glosses itself; "ancient and modern...ancient, starlit walls" recycles descriptors. Template cadence runs across paragraphs (nine sentences begin with "The/Her/Elena's/She"). Stock metaphors: "hollow and adrift," "rock bottom," "beacon...in a world of darkness." Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("teach withering to bloom," "curtains of intention") inconsistent with scene-grounded POV. Information density is low—most sentences elaborate a single abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory anchors (brass edges, velvet cloth, rain dance). Several lines loop thematically without advancing knowledge: "patterns that transcended reason and logic" / "underlying structures of human consciousness" / "invisible currents guiding cryptocurrency markets" restate the same abstraction. Template cadence appears in expository blocks: "From a worn leather case… he retrieved… / Today, like every day… he methodically recorded…" Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors harm clarity. Information density drops mid-story as dialogue summarizes the project rather than dramatizing discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops across multiple paragraphs: "anguish and joy" / "anguished joy" recurs without added pressure (lines 6, 16, 26, 31); "end of innocence" appears four times; "atoms of nostalgia" is repeated label-only in six lines. Template cadence in middle section: "She watched… She felt… She was no longer…" Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "captured sunset," "amber silence," "constellation," "touching the eternal" stack in rapid succession without coherent vehicle. Stock metaphor "bridge the gap" and "touching the eternal" dull closure beat. Apply −1.2 for loops/templates and figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but multiple passages loop conceptually: the shadow's nature is described across several paragraphs with near-synonyms ("metamorphose," "transforming," "effortlessly elegant," "reverse origami") without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "shadow + verb" stems. Figurative density is high throughout without escalation pattern, and some connective tissue ("In the years since," "Night after night") reads as scaffold. No single artifact obscures closure, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and thematic restatements pervade: paragraphs 5/7/12/16/22 all announce "reconstruction" and "shedding layers" with minor synonym variation. Template cadence appears in repeated "The chameleon [action]" and "Elara [reflection]" sentence stems across the middle third. Stock metaphors ("shattered like glass," "tempered by reality") and therapy-speak ("balance self-respect with compassion," "conscious choice made with eyes wide open") dull specificity. The final paragraph summarizes prior content rather than advancing it. High-frequency adjective stacking ("gentle," "fragile," "quietly vivid," "shimmering stillness") creates a uniform texture that obscures pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The tunnel had taught her that healing wasn't about opening wounds but learning to live within their stories" restates prior lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the second half: "The coffee rings had shown her the method, but her heart had finally shown her the meaning" / "The plants whispered not of pain now but of belonging, the displaced miracle returned to the earth from which all healing grows." Stock metaphors (dawn stretching fingers, meteor hush) and therapy-speak labels ("integration," "testaments to survival") appear in peak beats without embodiment. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total −1.5 in Q7, plus the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops pervade the text: lines 6/13, 10/25, 14/32, and 20/26 restate identical content without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., "The crystal gazer… / While forgotten lyrics… / The psychometry reading…"), flattening rhythm across 15+ sentences. Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "phantom light," "silver halide crystals," "cathedral," "quantum archive." The final third (lines 27–33) continues the loops rather than tightening, obscuring any closure image. Artifacts touch every structural beat, warranting the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent lines: "Elara stood before the aurora-lit archway" / "The astronomical instrument in her hands felt heavy" / "She had come here across an unwritten calendar" stacks three intro-style stems. Figurative density without payoff: "moonstruck face," "ethereal light," "nebulous concepts," "prisoner behind bars of too much input" crowd the opening without constraining action. The closure paragraph recycles metaphor ("thaw," "flood," "river flowing freely," "sea of possibility") in synonym churn. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("connecting celestial points with invisible lines that only eyes like hers could perceive") that obscures rather than sharpens the ritual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fractured lullaby," "wave functions," "bloomed with living data") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, verging on overwriting in non-peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "divergent archive" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure. Template cadence in "Through wave functions" opener and "The glowing dune" subject runs flatten rhythm. Information density is moderate—many lines layer image and theme, but scaffold phrases like "this fractured world, this broken lullaby" add texture without advancing causality. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, but loop and density issues lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "translocated with an object" / "object clutched in his hand"; "hum of insight began vibrating" / "crescendoed into comprehension"; "wild frontier of his mind" recurs six times without functional variation. Template cadence runs appear in the dream sequence ("He understood… He wandered… The small gear had integrated…"). Figurative density ("mechanical rainforest," "rivers of emotional light," "crystalline memories") saturates without clear propulsion, and the gear's function is explained rather than dramatized. Stock metaphor strings (frontier, nexus, symphony) and label-only traits ("sixth sense," "probable miracles") cluster in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences ("Balancing their small boats...") alternating with shorter declaratives. Figurative language is dense—"boundary between worlds grew thin as silk," "glimmered like fish in deep waters," "waterfall of liquid twilight"—but patterns repeat: metaphors of thinness, veiling, and luminosity appear in most beats without escalation. Template cadence emerges in mid-section: "They followed... they reached... they guided..." runs across three beats (−0.4). Clarity remains high; no loops or scaffold obscure causality. Paraphrase appears once: "traverse" echoes across multiple lines without added pressure (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. However, the middle third contains paraphrase loops: "The fortress had been built by musicians" is immediately followed by "Each Note-Weaver had sacrificed their voice," then "The unpardonable silence was the fortress's heart"—three adjacent lines restating the same revelation without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "The bellhop realized... He remained... singing..." (−0.3). Stock metaphors like "heart overflowing with purpose" and "dance with newfound rhythm" in peak beats reduce specificity (−0.3). Figurative language ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope") is purposeful and voice-motivated, avoiding overwriting. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    Recurring phrase patterns create template cadence: "The diminutive titan" appears twice, "ancient temple library lost in time" repeats verbatim, "pause of shifting constellations" recurs three times, and "regally unpretentious" appears twice. Stock metaphor strings ("eyes that had witnessed the rise and fall of empires," "radiating a power that belied her stature") dull immediacy in peak beats. The climactic moment—"time itself seemed to shatter, revealing the pretender's true form"—relies on abstract summary rather than concrete action or image. Several paraphrase loops: "The library's graceful collapse" is restated as "walls dissolving" and "books dissolved into nothingness" within adjacent lines. Information density is low in the middle third, where ancestor messages are quoted without advancing Elara's tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple template-cadence runs flatten momentum: "Her fingers paused… Her fingers resumed… Marina's fingers continued… Marina's fingers continued… her fingers rhythmically one last time." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences (e.g., "observation and study" / "patient observation," "slowly returning" / "reclaiming"). Stock metaphors ("schools of fish," "watercolors left in the rain") and the phrase "periodically eternal" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Sanctuary phrasing ("whispered of deeper changes," "ancient rhythm of change") elevates register without adding pressure. These artifacts combine for baseline −1.0 in Q7; no single issue touches closure directly but the accumulation dulls line-level propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: paragraphs 2–3 both open with "She [verb]" and restate her cosmic connection; paragraphs 10 and 15 repeat "hum" with synonym churn ("hummed with energy," "humming growing louder"). Stock metaphors accumulate without transformation: "broken ships and broken dreams," "bridge between worlds," "child of the stars." Sentence openings are uniform (15 of 21 paragraphs begin with "The" or "She"), creating rhythmic monotony. The closure beat (final two paragraphs) is overwritten with stacked abstractions ("revolution of the spirit," "transform their world," "reconnect them to the stars") that obscure rather than sharpen the image. Information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    Template cadence pervades: "Maya had accidentally discovered... Maya had always dismissed... Maya understood... Maya smiled." Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (volcanic rock energy / hot springs solace, telepathy / visions, destiny awakened / prophecies glimpsed). Stock metaphors ("ancient energy pulse," "burning in her mind") and therapy-speak ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent") flatten peak beats. The three-day decoding montage is pure summary. Sentence openings repeat "Maya [verb]" or "The [noun]" across most paragraphs. Figurative language is sparse, but what appears is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose carries significant template artifacts: repetitive sentence stems ("Maya would," "She would trace," "She felt"), paraphrase loops (paragraphs 6-7 restate the ritual without advancing it), and elevated diction that clashes with moment-to-moment perception ("perpetual rebirth a mirror for her own journey"). The scaffold phrase "to anchor optimism in realism" appears three times, including in the critical final paragraph where it flattens the closure image. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("had come to her," "had grown nimble," "had become visible"). Information density is uneven: early paragraphs compress effectively while middle sections loop through the somatic-marker concept. The opening and closing images carry some power, but overwriting dulls their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout, with mixed effectiveness: "charcoal into gray oblivion," "books that curled at the edges like forgotten memories," "luminescent ache." Several rhetorical questions recur without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "fragmented reality" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "luminescent ache" appears three times, two as identical repetition. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "seemed to breathe") stack in middle paragraphs. Artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure beat. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, template cadence (rhetorical questions), and filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    句-level clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Grammar and tense are consistent. However, the piece exhibits scaffold loops and template cadence: repeated "Their [noun]" openings across paragraphs, synonym churn around "serene anger" (mentioned three times without evolution), and paraphrase loops (the opening two paragraphs restate the eclipse-time link). The disappearance beat—the story's climax—uses passive constructions ("began to dissolve," "had seemingly disappeared") that flatten immediacy. The final paragraphs pile exposition ("Record this," the three-year backstory, the albinism extended metaphor) rather than propelling toward a charged image. No figurative muddle, but density and propulsion sag in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoing library under snow" appears six times; "contraband truths" three times; "bravely/brilliantly conflicted" twice; "dizzying quiet" twice; "within the blink that follows surprise" twice. Template cadence is evident in repetitive sentence stems and declarative summary structures. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") stack in emotional beats without voice justification. Stock metaphors ("touches of light in the darkness") and therapy-speak labels ("bravely conflicted") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("brilliantly conflicted and resolute"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally strong, but template cadence appears in multiple paragraphs: "Her father had been...but Rhiannon had chosen," "The roses responded...By the time she finished," "Rhiannon believed...Rhiannon's visitors." Paraphrase loops occur ("nurture rather than captured" / "nurture life" within two paragraphs). The final third contains expository summary ("her greatest achievement was...a thread of meaning") that replaces scene pressure. Apply −0.8 for template stems and loops touching the closure third, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries vivid figurative language ("sleepwalking constellations," "voicing silence") but suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Examples: "The fisher smiled, cool-headed once more" repeats the opening trait; "His motivation burned steady" and "his motivation fulfilled" frame the same idea; "when patterns broke themselves" appears three times without variation. Sentence stems recur mechanically ("The fisher possessed," "He would return," "And in the sound wave garden"). These loops dull momentum and drop information density, particularly in the final third where closure should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template phrasing: "rosewood pen nib" appears six times with minimal functional variance; "devotedly observant" is recycled across paragraphs; "orbits of regret" recurs without reweighting. Key beats are summarized ("Hours passed," "she finally had it") rather than dramatized, flattening momentum. Figurative language ("orbits of regret," "echoing observatory seemed to lean in") remains decorative rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies and figurative language ("time folds," "meteor hush") is purposeful. Minor loops: "The amber had been a gift" / "Elias now stared at the amber piece" revisits the object without advancing pressure. "Dissonance of old guilt that nested in his chest—a guilt still fresh after ten years" is a paraphrase loop. The firmware's mechanics are told in summary ("had developed an uncanny attribute") rather than shown through operation. Clarity is high overall, and the final image (tattooing musical notes) is concrete. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative scaffold and stock metaphor ("echoes from across millennia," "ghostly rhythm") lower density in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "old certainties dissolved" / "traditional methods… failed to reveal answers"; "the unlearning continued, but now with a collective acceptance of its purpose" restates the prior beat without new pressure. Template cadence runs stack in the final third: "When exhaustion finally claimed… they lay back… whispering gallery tile flakes passed… each hearing messages…" The closing lines loop thematic summaries—"no longer a lilac unease, but rather a deep contentment born of embracing chaos"—with therapy-speak labels ("deep contentment," "beautiful mysteriously") that dull the image. Figurative language is generic: "dissolved like sugar in rain," "twilight on the verge of something momentous."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (cracked stones, warm tessera, fractured light). However, several passages loop conceptually: the opening paragraph establishes "retrocognitively trapped" and "ghosts of the past," then the next paragraph immediately restates "His mind constantly wandered to the time before." Stock phrases ("warm coldness," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") recur without fresh inflection. The final third stacks abstract descriptors ("aberrant mercy," "revolutionary kindness," "gentle radical's vision") that feel more like prompt fulfillment than character-driven language. Template cadence is minimal, but thematic label-speak in peak beats triggers a −0.6 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is largely clear but marred by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences begin with "He + verb" or "The + noun," creating a mechanical rhythm ("He began to sing," "He remembered discovering," "He saw himself"). Synonym churn appears in the middle section (echoes/memories/possibilities cycle without added pressure). Stock metaphors—"ribbons of colored light," "symphony of scents," "threshold between past and present"—accumulate without specificity. The figurative language in peak beats (the performance) is dense but mixed: notes are "golden threads" that "stitch" while also being "bridges," and the coin "pulses" while "seeming to spin." Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("allowing himself to dissolve"), lowering momentum and capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The motivation to illuminate hidden pathways" appears twice in nearly identical phrasing; "fractally precise" recurs as a label without added pressure; "muscovite geode sliver" is named in full eight times, creating synonym-avoidance churn. Filter-verb stacks ("Maya had noticed," "Maya watched," "Maya carefully documented") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors ("willowglass hope," "bridge between the physical world and the realm of thought") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch multiple beats, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports pacing through the descent. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "The fossil didn't answer... The fossil had chosen... The elm leaf fossil had been waiting..." creates a loop. Figurative density is low, but "defied gravity, hovering silently" and "threads" are stock rather than specific. Information density is adequate; no major scaffolding. Clarity and momentum are serviceable but without propulsive compression at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive template cadence: runs of "As [subject verb], [subject verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across adjacent sentences create drumbeat rhythm without taught pattern. Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening third and final quarter—"quietly inspired" recurs label-only; "shared wisdom" cycles through synonym variants without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt," "found herself") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock phrasing: "profound connection," "timeless message," "unfolding story" reduces specificity. Cumulative artifact debt at closure triggers disallowance of 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, especially around the core concept: "fixing what's broken" appears in multiple forms across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "silver hush" recurs four times, functioning as scaffolding rather than charged reprise. Mixed metaphors appear ("storm within him raged as violently as the winds that now whipped the snow into miniature tornadoes" while "silver hush of the afternoon settled"). Stock metaphor strings ("frozen between seasons," "ashes have their own kind of power") and elevated register in peak beats ("vouchsafe," "crucible," "prudently daring") drift toward thesaurus-itis. Template cadence is present in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "No longer would it…" constructions. Apply −0.9 cumulative for loops, stock metaphor, and template cadence across high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "palimpsest promise" is re-explained across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "ambient awareness," "closely attentive," and "careful attention" recur as restatements. Stock metaphors ("precious vellum," "absorb the very mist") and elevated diction ("distill complexity into essence") feel ornamental rather than earned. The final paragraph restates closure rather than charging it. Template cadence in mid-section ("The coachman [verb]…," "The yarn needle [verb]…") flattens momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several passages loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "The careful precision of his movements belied the sharp gentleness…" echoes description already woven into action; "by following sun patterns" repeats three times without functional variation. Template cadence appears in stacked "he [verb]" stems across middle paragraphs. "Sharp gentleness" recurs as a label rather than being shown through contradictory action. Metaphor density is high but not incoherent; the figurative language remains legible. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (wildflowers tilt, bees stir), but scaffold sentences like "With the setting sun came another moment when chimney smoke rose again…" slow momentum. Apply loop/scaffold deductions: −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs, capping Q7 in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "wistfully pragmatic" appears twice in identical phrasing; "quivering hush" is repeated without reweighting; "luminous harbor by moonlight" recurs as a label. Stock metaphors ("liquid mercury," "urban jungle") and therapy-speak ("protected vulnerability") appear in peak beats without transformation. Template cadence: "She [verb], her [noun]" pattern runs across multiple sentences. Information density is low in the middle third, which summarizes backstory rather than advancing pressure. Deduction: −1.0 for loops and template stems touching the closure section.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is legible but loops and scaffolds proliferate: "atomically reflective" appears three times, "coexist/coexistence" four times, and adjacent paragraphs begin with identical stems. Paraphrase loops are evident—paragraphs 6 and 16 both describe Elena before reflective surfaces with near-identical content. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "breathing lungs," "flowing currents," "phantoms dancing," "golden light" stack without causal payoff. Information density is low; most sentences restate mood rather than advance situation. The final image ("stood… and finally understood") is abstract summary, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "After the cloud bursts" appears four times with minimal variation; "keeper of secrets" recurs in near-identical phrasing across three paragraphs; "inevitably whimsical" is repeated without progression. Template cadence: "She had [past action]" opens three consecutive beats mid-story. Stock metaphors ("washed clean," "muddy waters," "thread that connects") lack fresh vehicle logic. The scaffold phrase "lotus temple rising from a massive lily pond" is recycled verbatim twice, and synonym churn ("rejoin," "reconnect," "connection") blurs rather than sharpens sense. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Apply baseline −1.4 in Q7 for spread, escalated to −1.7 for closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The tricksters' ability to manipulate human perception through subtle frequency manipulation had turned society against itself" is immediately restated as "these weren't benevolent messages from distant stars but cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself." Runs of identical sentence stems appear throughout ("The faculty had dismissed," "Professor Merrick, once her mentor," "He had published"). Stock metaphors ("invisible fingers," "elongated shadows," "whispers in between signals") dilute specificity. The final third contains template cadence and synonym churn ("cautiously hopeful nature," "cautiously hopeful expression," "cautious optimism"), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and key images are vivid (the compass "insect-like device," starlight pulsing in response). However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("She closed her eyes and began to hum, mimicking the reverberation… The memory of that haunting music had stayed with her"), and scaffold phrases recur ("It was during," "It was an unprecedented act," "It was the hidden heart"). The final two paragraphs stack summary constructions ("The vital key was not…," "Elara's lifelong claustrophobia faded…," "The wistful rebellion that had fueled…") that flatten momentum at closure. Deduction: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; −0.4 for summary stacking in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean with varied sentence structure. However, several scaffold loops appear: "furrowed hush" recurs identically without reweighting, "methodical" is restated multiple times without demonstration, and the final paragraph stacks thematic declarations ("Justice has been dormant," "empathy never truly disappears") that paraphrase the same sentiment. Stock phrases like "uncanny accuracy" and "countless witnesses" dilute specificity. Information density is adequate but peaks with exposition rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The spongey dread had settled… The spongey dread in the room had shifted"; "reversible technology… reversible… reversible"; "experimental weather station" appears four times. Figurative language is stock ("spongey dread," "copper nail… talisman and burden"). Sentence openings repeat ("The experimental weather station," "The shipwrecked journals," "Their…"). Information density is moderate; many lines restate rather than advance. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −1.2 for loops, stems, and stock metaphor density across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The scaffold wrap flutters intensified, their map now undeniable—a pathway to where the hitchhiker had gone" restates what prior lines already claimed without added pressure (apply −0.4). Synonym churn: "luminous disbelief" appears three times, "pixelated amnesty" four times, "bridge-song" five times, "scaffold wrap flutters" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs with decorative variation but no causal advance (apply −0.6). Template cadence: eight sentences open with "The [noun]" in the first half alone (apply −0.4). Stock metaphors: "tapestry of redemption," "lantern illuminating the path," "wings around his frame." Mixed metaphor: scaffold wrap "flutters" form "wings" and simultaneously "map" a "secret"—three vehicles for one unclear effect. Filter-verb stack: "began to recount," "seemed to listen," "began to play" across three lines (apply −0.3). Register drift: "transfiguration," "cognitive," "rendered in pixels" clash with fiddler's voice. Information density is low—most sentences restate prior symbolic claims. Total deductions in Q7: baseline −0.6 (loops), −0.6 (churn), −0.4 (template), −0.3 (filters), capped at −1.7 under artifact penalty pack, plus coherence muddle −0.3; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "bridge-song," "scaffold wrap," "luminous disbelief"), so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "perceptively calm" and "polished calm" cycle as synonyms across multiple paragraphs; "territorial markers" recurs without variation or reweighting. Template cadence runs damage momentum: "Each bill represented...Each bill a physical territory...Each evening, Elias would study them." The Marcus confrontation beat stacks filter verbs ("attempting to dissuade," "his only reaction was") that dull immediacy. Stock metaphor strings appear in closure beats: "dusky harmony of evening," "peacefully resolved to whatever came next." Information density is low—many sentences restate the same thematic claim (e.g., three separate assertions that Elias differs from his father) without advancing situation or choice. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "understanding was dawning" / "As understanding dawned completely" and "burden" repeated five times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had witnessed… deciphered… received") cluster in the final third. Stock metaphors ("slipping away like sand through fingers," "silent dance") and the thesaurus phrase "daylily-pressed telegram" (repeated identically three times) dull specificity. Clarity remains intact, but density and propulsion suffer from scaffold and synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "expanding circles of consciousness" / "her mind spiraling outward like the vortex itself" restate the same image. Template cadence: "The first circle revealed... The second circle brought... The third circle touched..." runs across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors: "leaves brushing against her skin like curious fingers," "slipped away like water." Clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but information density is low—many sentences unpack a single concept without advancing pressure. No significant artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: "dreams remained separate from waking life" / "dreams and reality were not opposing forces" restates the same idea; "purposefully curious" / "purposeful determination" synonym-cycles. Template cadence dominates: "They were trapped...They clutched...They found...They began...They stepped." Mixed metaphor: "volatile waters of possibility" (water) crashes into "root-bound" (earth) without coherence. Filter-verb stack in ritual beat ("began the ritual, touching...murmuring...began to glow") dulls immediacy. Figurative density ("blue-tinted grass shimmered," "elongated blue shadows," "pathways of blue through darkness") in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries high information density with vivid concrete detail. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "patch holes in the soul, hers and others'" restates the mission introduced earlier; "fierce gentleness" and variants recur without added pressure; the final paragraph recycles the opening posture with near-identical phrasing ("reckless idealist," "fiercely gentle, recklessly hopeful, utterly resolved"). Template cadence is minimal, but the cumulative scaffold weakens momentum in the closure third, triggering penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "After the applause had faded" / "After the applause, after the dust settled" and "discovering purpose after loss" repeated three times with minor variation. Template cadence runs (multiple "After X" and "the way Y" constructions) flatten momentum. Figurative language is often strained ("echo valley longing," "hollowed out like the abandoned quarry") and mixed (the quarry as metaphor for loss, yet also literal setting). Information density is uneven; some beats layer meaning, others cycle through synonym variants of grief without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "haunted ambitions" restated across two sentences, "magnetic arbor" described in three adjacent clauses with synonym churn, and the seed's properties recycled without new information. Template cadence: runs of "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" openings stack across the first half. Register drifts into pseudo-academic abstraction ("physics of transition," "analogical thinking," "electromagnetic anomalies") without voice motivation. Orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) disallows 9+ and caps high-band entries at 8.8 globally; Q7 artifact spread triggers additional line-level penalty (−1.2 for loops, cadence, and register drift combined).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and purposeful word choice ("titan-gear," "story-silver," "liquid story-silver"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops in the final third: "identities migrating like tides, preserved through acceptance" echoes "accepting contradictions" and "synthesis of all previous selves" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Each heavy step caused..."; "The librarian's massive mechanical armor...") and the closing summary paragraph stacks abstract claims without propulsion. These artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "abandoned hopes" appears five times, "resonant hush" three times, "latent radiance" twice, often without added pressure. Template cadence: "She leaned closer… She closed her eyes… She lowered it… When she returned…" runs through the second half. Figurative density in the cave sequence—"liquid sunlight," "crown of living light," "vibration that could be felt"—blurs concrete action. Stock metaphors ("walls—whether concrete or emotional") and therapy-speak ("help them remember their radiance") in the final third trigger −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but paraphrase loops proliferate: paragraphs 14–15 restate the diversion metaphor; paragraphs 27–28 recycle "self-forgiveness" without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had…," "The…") appear in clusters. Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "raw solace," "tears in bellows and hearts," "drowning in currents" all arrive in the final third, blurring instead of sharpening the closure image. The phrase "市政府 papers" is a mistaken character insertion that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple artifact clusters drag the score: paraphrase loops ("the library only appeared when the fog thickened to this impenetrable density, turning the ordinary woods into something otherworldly" restates the mist-appearance link already established), template cadence ("They had begun," "They realized," "They knew" as repetitive stems), and stacked modifiers without propulsion ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation," "suppressed emotions and unrealized intentions"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the library-entry beat without coherent pattern (−0.5 density penalty). The closure beat itself ("knowledge they had gained was now their secret") is summary rather than image, dulling the final line (−1.0 cumulative in Q7; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "fruit left too long on the branch," "perforated destiny," "fragile seedling," "dream propagated," "velvet dark," "cold vacancy." In the climax, stacked metaphors—"frozen constellations," "cold harmonics," "dream propagated," "echo blooming"—compete for attention without adding distinct information. The penultimate sentence runs a template cadence: "The empire would claim X, a Y. But the true Z, the dream…" Paraphrase loops appear: "silent, cold harmonics" echoes "pure, so cold" from two paragraphs prior. Applying −0.6 for figurative density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.2 for paraphrase loop totals −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished and error-free, with varied sentence openings and purposeful rhythm in the ritual sequence. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "threshold of stillness" recurs three times, "radiant hush" twice, "lucidly watchful" twice, and "emerald chip" + "captured memories" cycle without reweighting. Figurative density is high without payoff—"velvet of night," "threads across a loom," "sparks of existence"—creating ornamental texture that does not advance pressure. Template cadence in the ritual beats ("The emerald chip grew warm… pulsed… now glowed") flattens propulsion. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than doing double work.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: multiple sentences restate "contentment/source/cycle/rebirth" without advancing pressure ("source of contentment," "embrace of all experiences as part of a larger pattern," "not in one place but in embracing all parts"). Template cadence: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "she [verb]" stems across many lines. Stock metaphors: "quiet dawn," "threads of fate," "scalloped against the clouds." Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("millennia," "testament," "suspended place") clashes with embodied urgency. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("someone who had become the source herself"). Applying −1.2 in Q7 for loop/template/stock cluster, plus −0.5 additional for artifacts in final third. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high; no causality breaks or spatial confusion. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "hollow mirror shard" appears six times with near-identical phrasing; "sincerely insincere" repeats three times without variation; "cloak of doubt" and "protected vulnerability" cycle through as interchangeable metaphors. Template cadence dominates reflective passages: "The [noun] had been… a tool she claimed… Elian had never seen…" Figurative density in high-pressure beats is moderate—no mixed metaphors, but stock phrasing ("weight of secrets," "voices joining in a complex melody") reduces specificity. Information density is low: many sentences paraphrase prior content (e.g., paragraphs 10–11 restate Elian's philosophy). Sentence openings vary; no grammar errors. Artifacts touch non-closure beats extensively (−0.8) and appear in the final third, triggering the 9+ disqualification globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Maya nodded slowly... Maya's lips pursed... Maya nodded again... Maya's eyes snapped open... Maya closed her eyes once more." Multiple lines restate the vanishing-to-appear concept without added pressure ("It doesn't disappear... It merely transforms its state of being" / "vanishing to appear wasn't about physical disappearance but about shedding false layers"). The metaphor "his chronological paradox mirroring the lesson at hand" is abstract and adds no concrete image. Combined, these trigger −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems, and the artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "historically reverent in ways few could comprehend, his very soul intertwined" restates the same mystical authority without added detail. Synonym churn appears in adjacent sentences—"pulse," "vibration," "resonance" cycle without functional distinction. Template cadence runs: four consecutive paragraphs open with "The [abstract noun]" or "Kael [verb]." Figurative language stacks without coherence: dust "bearing memories," air "shimmer with anticipation," shadows "danced where ancestors walked." Apply −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive loops, cadence artifacts, and metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens. Line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and caps Q6 at 7.6 per cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or tense slips. However, paraphrase loops appear: "crystalline window… crystalline air formations," "brilliant dimness… brilliantly… bright yet lacking true radiance" within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the climax paragraph: "As he approached… With deliberate fingers… The moment the final clasp…" stacks similar sentence openings without purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize rather than advance (e.g., "Images flooded his mind" tells rather than shows the vision). The untranslated word "волшебные" (Russian for "magical") is a copy artifact that harms clarity; apply −0.4 in Q7 for this single opacity touching a key object.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity holds throughout. However, figurative density clusters without payoff: "meteor hush of anticipation," "luminous vow of pure silver light," "threads of starlight and seawater," "layers of reality folded like origami" stack within a few beats, blurring rather than sharpening pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The sounds do have colors" immediately follows Hemingway's prior description of sound-as-color. Several filter verbs ("seemed to signify," "couldn't yet grasp") dull immediacy in early beats. No major loops obscure causality, but cumulative drift lowers density.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "quiet enthusiasm" appears five times; "stellar doubt" three times; "backwards prophecy" four times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added meaning. Template cadence: "Loran [verb]…" / "The [noun] had [verb]…" recurs across a dozen lines. "Ambered" modifies both light and deck redundantly. Figurative language ("cosmic focus," "symphony of human experience") clusters in the climax without grounding. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but template cadence pervades the middle third: "He traced… remembering," "A traveling poet had once told him," "The scattered light… grew more intense," "Each beam seemed to carry." Paraphrase loops cluster around the naming beats—"to give a name" / "give names to the nameless" / "names for nameless fears"—without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense ("shadows made solid," "tears of centuries") but occasionally mixed (tears staining a cloak, light crystallizing drawings). The final third's repetition of "scattered light" and "crystallize" crosses into synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops and stock metaphors appear: "fractured bronze ship's bell that lay at his feet like a fallen giant," "casting the once-broken ship's bell anew," "the profound quiet" followed by "this profound quiet." Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("As the sun finished... the mage walked away... he felt for the first time") and thesaurus-itis ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion" recur as labels). Figurative density in the climax ("sound like settling stars," "liquid sky") muddies rather than sharpens the image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images land cleanly ("sapphire-hued liqueur label," "mirrored hush"). However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "deeper into the town's history, deeper into forgotten corners" repeats structure without added pressure; "the reservoir town would no longer be merely water and memory, but reclaimed truth" restates theme already implicit. Filter verbs ("felt compelled," "seemed to hold") dull immediacy in reflective beats. The final two paragraphs summarize action (phone calls, gathering evidence, dawn watch) rather than dramatizing, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "Before the final transformation" appears three times, "touch of wonder" twice, "ancient freshness" twice, all without reweighting. Template cadence runs appear in the middle third: "The waterfall shimmered... The crystal began... The flame beneath... The starlings suddenly..." Figurative language stacks without coherence—"ancient freshness" and "touch of wonder" remain abstract throughout. Stock metaphors ("molten copper," "halo around her face") dull specificity. Information density is low: many sentences restate mood without advancing knowledge or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "parachute buckle" recurs across seven paragraphs with decorative rephrasing; "attentively inventive" and "remembering through muscle memory" are restated almost identically; "after the radio static cleared" bookends without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("The watcher's burden," "The parachute buckle," "Remembering through muscle memory"). Figurative language in most beats without payoff: "soundless echo," "silent language of celestial patterns," "infinite puzzle scattered across eternity" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen sense. Information density is low—adjacent paragraphs restate the same vigilance/trust/burden concept without advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph includes another "parachute buckle" mention and "watcher's burden" restatement), triggering the −1.7 band and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent sentences: "she had been running from since her ego's dissolution during the Great Unraveling two years prior, when she had witnessed the collapse of her former reality and self" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She could see the lies… and unravel them… She placed her hands… She closed her eyes…" Figurative language clutters peak beats: "kaleidoscope of genuine emotion," "fortress against feeling," "bridge between opposites" stack without specificity. Filter-verb reliance ("she could see," "she realized") dulls immediacy. Multiple text artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties and 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence plague the text: "mournfully eager" appears four times, "tending to the unspoken" three times, "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" recurs verbatim across beats without evolving function. Synonym churn ("thrum," "hum," "roar") substitutes for propulsion. The pull cord handle is mentioned five times in similar phrasing. These artifacts accumulate to −1.2 in Q7 and disqualify 9+ globally. Clarity remains high and figurative language is controlled, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "boundaries of light" appears in seven sentences doing the same thematic work; "the guardian" opens nine consecutive sentences in template cadence; "had learned" / "had been" / "had evolved" stacks past-perfect constructions without varying rhythm. Stock metaphors ("patchwork illusion," "playground of possibility," "dance with them") and therapy-speak ("make friends with uncertainty," "state of consciousness one carried within") dull the peak beats. Mixed metaphor: "boundaries of light" are simultaneously barriers, invitations, and currents the guardian navigates. Register drifts into essay mode ("the culmination of their motivation," "another density") at closure. Information density is low—most sentences restate the guardian's waiting or the pendant's humming without advancing situation or choice. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dense figurative overload: nearly every sentence in the opening third stacks metaphors ("frozen bloom," "prisoners of a stifling destiny," "ember nexus pulsed with dormant power") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 9 and 10 restate Elias's sensitive heart in adjacent lines. Template cadence dominates: "The crozier had... a moment the family had... but Elias now saw..." and "His first attempt... The second attempt... the final ritual" follow identical stems across multiple beats, triggering −0.5. Stock phrases ("when the penny dropped," "quiet certainty that settled in his bones") and synonym churn ("hopeless alchemist," "hopeless had never been his nature") reduce immediacy. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("alchemical marriage," "conceptual of creative destruction") inconsistent with POV lexicon. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood rather than advancing causality. Cumulative artifact debt disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentences are grammatically clean, but several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "abandoned city suspended over the gorge" recurs three times with minimal variation; "serenely electric" is repeated as both descriptor and aura without evolving function. Template cadence runs through the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] began to [verb]" stems. The tuning climax compresses into summary ("began the delicate process...not with tools but with intention") rather than concrete action, flattening the closure beat's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "vanishing ferry" / "disappeared every night," "patterns glowed brighter" / "interconnected patterns," "permanent transient" repeated verbatim across beats. Template cadence dominates ("He wore... He picked up... He watched... He adjusted..."). Stock metaphors clutter peak moments ("liquid starlight," "lover returning from a long absence"). Figurative density in the grotto sequence (stalactites of frozen time, waters containing memories, moons representing past/present/future) obscures causality without pattern-teaching. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences harm momentum: "Her absence had left a void in his life, a hole he attempted to fill with his art" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses; "Colors that had once were vibrant" is a grammatical slip. Stock metaphors ("infinite tree," "rhythm of two hearts beating as one") appear in the closure beat without fresh inflection. The phrase "as memories altered" recurs as a frame device but without clear causal meaning—does time pass, or do memories literally shift? Applying cumulative artifact penalties (−0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence in peak beats, −0.3 for stock metaphor in closure) and rounding for a total near −1.3 in Q7, landing in the mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clean and readable with good information density in places. Several paraphrase loops appear: "discovered a remarkably preserved boat anchor chain link" immediately followed by "The link sat on his desk now"; "unfolded horizons" echoed across paragraphs; "somber marvel" repeated verbatim. Template cadence appears in the middle: "The process was meditative... Kael would sit for hours... Each session expanded his consciousness" uses parallel construction without payoff. Stock metaphors like "bioluminescent fire" and "blue marble of Earth" reduce freshness. Sentence openings vary adequately and no grammar errors appear, but the repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops drag momentum in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repeated "reeling hush" (three times) and "persistently curious" (twice) create minor loops. "Decades-old" appears five times, becoming scaffold. The phrase "contact tracer for hearts/souls" in the opening is metaphorically strained. Sentence variety is adequate; information density drops in expository beats explaining the grandmother backstory. The final paragraph's moralizing summary flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph: "prevented a tragedy" → "saved this child from an unspeakable fate."

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence dominates: nine consecutive paragraphs in the middle third begin with "The" or a noun subject, flattening rhythm. Paraphrase loops recur ("phase transitions" appears six times; "undersea cables" five times without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("tired giant," "fibrous veins," "sacred silence") accumulate without fresh inflection. Information density is low—scaffolding like "Tonight's mission was one of return" and "This was the crashing hush she had come to anticipate" tell rather than advance. The final third sustains momentum better, but artifacts in the middle third measurably dull propulsion. Applying −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, and −0.3 for stock phrasing totaling −1.2, plus minor filter-verb stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs: "The radio static finally cleared" repeats as "after the radio static cleared" three times; "death certificate error survivor" recurs five times with identical phrasing. Figurative language clusters without payoff ("liquid darkness pools," "snow globe of night," "captured auroras") in ways that blur rather than sharpen. Sentence stems repeat ("The porcelain shard," "The snow," "The wisdom") creating drumbeat monotony. The final paragraph summarizes the entire thematic journey rather than advancing through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no severe loops or filter-verb stacks. However, multiple paragraphs open with identical "The storyteller" or "His" stems, creating template cadence. Stock phrases ("tears streaming down his face," "the twilight of his years") appear in peak beats. Information density is moderate—many lines describe rather than advance. The climax relies on declarative summary ("was finally revealing") instead of taut sensory unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies across paragraphs, but several passages rely on repetitive stems and near-synonym loops: "harmony untamed" recurs five times without meaningful reweighting, "frostbitten hope" appears three times as a stock phrase, and "metamorphose/metamorphosis" cycles without adding pressure. The phrase "the flint arrowhead" opens three sentences with identical structure. Figurative language is dense ("frostbitten hope," "cosmic joke," "gravitationally playful") but some metaphors are strained or abstract rather than sensory. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (arrowhead description + emotional state) but others paraphrase prior content ("witness rather than capture" is restated across two paragraphs). No major causality breaks, but the loops and template cadence lower momentum (−0.8 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition).

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is largely clean and flows well, but it carries multiple text artifacts that dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "her music a temporary escape" echoes "her music carrying the magic"; "resonantly soft" is repeated without reweighting; "the gap between knowing and understanding" appears three times as a label rather than dramatized state. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The mechanical world was changing... Beauty was reawakening... people had begun to look up..." Figurative language clusters without clear payoff: "tarnished wonder," "profound release," "impossible flowers," "gears bloomed into intricate patterns." These artifacts touch the closure montage, reducing its charge. The opening and middle sections show stronger propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid without overwriting. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: "the day's lone mail drop" appears twice as a scaffolding phrase; "respectfully rebellious" is told rather than shown; the final four paragraphs loop thematically, restating the glue/chain/storm metaphor in adjacent lines without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing: "Every delivery was a story, every absence a link…" "Soon, he'd deliver…" "In a territory where…" These summary gestures replace scene work and dull the closure image. Deduction −0.8 for loops and template stems in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the climax carries figurative language ("whispering gleam," "misting hush began to swirl," "creatures of light dancing," "symphony of rebirth"), creating a template cadence of lush abstraction that dulls propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "interpret silence as possibility" recurs verbatim across three paragraphs; "quietly persistent" echoes in "quiet persistence." The final paragraph stacks four abstract phrases ("infinite possibility," "potential waiting to be born," "whispering gleam," "misting hush") in two sentences, obscuring the closure image. Stock metaphors ("symphony of rebirth," "canvas of possibility") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "felt an irresistible urge," "understood that") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Template sentence stems: "The carpenter's quiet persistence had unlocked…" and "With a smile that held…" share identical construction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence openings show variety, but the prose exhibits clear template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" and "Margaret [verbed]" structures recur heavily, with paraphrase loops around "tattered silk scarf" (five near-identical descriptors across the story) and "hyperbolic geometry" mentions. Stock metaphors—"long-lost lovers," "roots seeking water," "synapses firing"—accumulate in mid-beats without fresh specificity. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she believed," "she felt," "she understood") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. The closure beat uses figurative summary ("stitched into her very soul") rather than concrete image, and the final paragraph loops conceptually over prior claims about purpose and secrets. Loop and scaffold penalties apply; −0.8 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft suffers from stock phrasing ("trembling hands," "tears blurred her vision," "breath between dreams and waking") and template cadence ("She was searching for," "She had discovered," "She noticed"). Figurative language is dense but often contradictory: "living, breathing images" on paper, "vitalize not just photographs but her very essence." The opening and closing paragraphs loop thematically—"hush of improbable beginnings" recurs—but the repetition feels mechanical rather than charged. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats: "capture not just the visual beauty but the essence of light" restates earlier "paint with light" descriptions without added pressure. Sentence openings converge on subject-verb stems, creating rhythmic monotony during the studio sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Figurative density is high: "starlight that inked the sky," "consciousness... traveled along pathways older than time," "idea pulsing like a captured star," "supernova." In the climactic beat (woman touching the thread), metaphor stacks without embodied action, dulling propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "to free an idea trapped behind fear" and "the idea has wings... but fear has bound them" restate the same content. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("Another heart unlocked, another truth set free") and the summary ending reduce closure sharpness. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower end of the −0.6 to −1.4 range.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("wooden hulls collapsed like skeletons surrendering to the persistent encroachment of nature"). Information density is high in the opening third. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "the memories weren't stolen but borrowed, preserved within this liminal space" is immediately echoed by "the memory thieves hadn't been cruel but rather preservers." The memory-recovery sequence recycles structure ("With each connection, a memory surfaced") without varying syntax. Stock phrases appear in peak beats ("washed over her with sharp clarity," "crisp nostalgia warming her heart"), dulling propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some lines do double duty (e.g., "walked backwards when nervous, retracing his familiar path"). Two paraphrase loops appear: the playground-swing metaphor recurs as ornament rather than escalation ("the hush as an empty playground swing drifts" / "the playground swing will soon drift to a stop"), and the shadow's behavior is restated without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening paragraph ("his footsteps echoing," "his hands trembled," "he began walking backwards") stacks participles. The figurative density—especially "combative tenderness," "shard-mirror archivist," "fractured truths"—clusters without clear pattern payoff. Register drifts into abstraction ("repository of fractured truths," "geometry of tea leaves") at moments where concrete action would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose suffers pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "The pruner [verb]" and "The [noun] [metaphor]" dominate sentence openings across the text. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("waterfall whispered ancient secrets," "fire within her never truly slept," "radiant hush embraced her like an old friend"). Figurative language in nearly every sentence of the ritual sequence (lines 10–25) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Synonym churn: "weaving between worlds" appears six times; "heirloom seed" eight times; "verdant parapet" four times; "radiant hush" three times. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 10–16 ("felt," "seemed," "thought") dulls immediacy during peak action. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "between worlds" and "radiant hush" without new charge). Apply −1.4 base for loops and template cadence; escalate to −1.7 for artifact presence in closure beat; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but several patterns recur: "Elena [verb]" openers appear in seven paragraphs, creating mild template cadence. "Interlaced hush" appears three times with near-identical function, reading as a thematic echo rather than escalating meaning. Figurative language is dense—"coiled like the shed skin of some ancient sea beast," "movements causing the light to bend unnaturally," "settled beneath the starlight like snowflakes finding earth"—which suits the Accumulative mode but occasionally slows momentum in the unraveling sequence. The phrase "lucid unrest" appears twice, first as modifier and then as transformed concept, which works but borders on self-conscious patterning. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph 11 ("felt herself becoming"). No loops or major clarity issues; information density is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "perceptive map framer with a methodically curious nature" → "Her methodically curious nature drove her" → "Elara's colleagues…had often questioned her methodically curious approach." Template cadence runs in the discovery sequence ("It aligned perfectly…The whispered chapel wasn't…Elara felt…"). Stock metaphor: "pathway to understanding" and "windows into the human relationship" dilute specificity. The final two paragraphs summarize thematic payoff rather than advancing scene pressure. Sentence openings show variety elsewhere, but clarity at closure is harmed by exposition replacing image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is largely clear with purposeful imagery (snow globe, ocean pressure, "water droplets rolling down its surface like tears"). However, the piece carries repeated conceptual loops: "letting go" appears six times, "physics of letting go" three times, "boundary/barriers between worlds" twice. Template cadence shows in several beats: "She had a first name basis…" / "That was why…" / "That was her true motivation…" Stock phrases cluster in the final third: "washed over her," "in that moment," "she understood." Information density is moderate; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The ghost was not malevolent but lonely" / "The ghost communicated through glitches" / "The ghost in code had learned to encode"—five sentences in close succession open with "The ghost" or "Elara." Stock metaphors: "time stretches like taffy," "cries for connection," "dance of light and color." Final paragraph recycles "misty courtyard above the clouds, between lightning and thunder" verbatim from the opening. Applying artifact penalties: loops −0.6, stock phrasing −0.4, redundancy −0.3 = −1.3 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks follow beats cleanly, with no major grammar errors. However, the piece suffers from scaffold and paraphrase loops: "encrypted diary" appears nine times, often in adjacent lines without new pressure; floor markers ("At floor two," "Floor five passed") create template cadence; and reflective passages recycle stems ("she recalled," "she considered," "she reflected"). The final third stacks abstract summary ("her role as an ascending servant had never been more meaningful") that dulls momentum. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated justification. Applying artifact deductions: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence across multiple beats (−0.5), filter-verb stacks in key moments (−0.5), and summary opacity near closure (−0.4); cumulative −1.6 within band, and artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: paragraphs 16–18 restate Elena's theory in near-synonyms, paragraphs 23–26 loop "memorializing" across four beats without added pressure. Sentences frequently open with "The" or "Elena" in runs (paragraphs 1–4, 11–14). Stock metaphors ("bright flash of discovery," "gentle glow of understanding") and the repeated "dusty starlight" phrase dull specificity. Information density is low; many lines rephrase prior claims rather than advancing story or character. Figurative language in the final third (paragraphs 22–27) stacks without causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    Paraphrase loops across multiple beats: "discovering the limits" recurs in lines 8, 14, and 22 with minimal variation; "her motivation transformed" (line 17) is restated in "her ultimate achievement" (line 21). Template cadence appears in the opening ("she moved…she had worked…she saw…she knelt"). Stock phrases ("heightened stillness," "discovery dawning," "ultimate achievement") cluster in final third. These artifacts dull propulsion and trigger −0.6 in Q7; they also disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and mostly concise with varied sentence structure. Information density is adequate; most lines advance observation or deduction. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The luminance...flickered" is restated as "stranded luminance flickered" without new pressure; "diligently curious" and "meticulously curious nature" recycle the same trait label. Template cadence emerges in mid-section beats: "Eli knelt...his fingers tracing," "From his pocket, Eli retrieved," "Around him, the airship crew went about." The final paragraphs stack summary statements ("feeling less like a machine," "would become even more valuable") that slow momentum rather than propelling through image. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he'd observed," "he realized") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy template cadence pervades: "Under the soft hush of..." appears three times, "hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment" twice, "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" twice, "like driftwood" twice, and "hall of mirrors" nine times. Paraphrase loops cluster around the tools and mirror descriptions. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat ("hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment clicked closed"). Register remains elevated but uniform throughout; no modulation under pressure. One stray character (精密) in "springs and精密 tools" breaks proofreading.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template stems pervade the text: "strangers into family" recurs four times without variation, "floating rock arches" appears in decorative position three times, and paragraph openers recycle "The" and "Elion" stems across adjacent beats. Stock phrases ("quiet satisfaction," "underlying hope," "forever thriving") replace concrete imagery. The line "brambled hope—tangled yes, with setbacks and challenges, but ultimately resilient" is meta-commentary that tells rather than showing texture. Simultaneity errors appear ("As Aris brought… the community gathered") when sequence is unclear, and the final section summarizes centuries in three paragraphs, collapsing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dense figurative language ("threads of fractured starlight and liquid shadow," "pane of hush," "nested patterns of cosmic defense") saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "hush…profound silence" (para 2), "hush…quiet" (para 6), and "nested patterns" recurs five times without evolving function. Template cadence runs: "He approached…he reverently lifted…He held…he traced…" (para 3–4) and "The hum grew…the vibration touched…Dreamers stirred…things paused…" (para 5–6). Stock metaphors ("whispers designed to slip through nested patterns like water through cracks") and therapy-speak labels ("beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") appear in closure beats, reducing specificity. Information density is high but momentum stalls under decorative weight; the closure image is dulled by accumulated ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained but the prose shows template patterns: "As [time phrase], [subject verb]..." opens multiple paragraphs; "graceless beauty" and "offhandedly exact" are recycled without variation. Information density is low in the final third where multiple sentences restate Elias's newfound peace without advancing pressure. The climactic rescue beats are summarized ("Elias led the travelers through the final stretch") rather than shown with immediate sensory detail. Metaphors like "twisted trees bore fruit that withered souls" lean purple without grounding in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythm varies, but paraphrase loops appear: "connection required flexibility" echoed by "divide and come together again"; "empty chrysalis...loss" repeated across paragraphs 5, 18, and 26. Template cadence in the final third: "The polymer chemist had learned...," "And sometimes...," "Her grief had transformed..." Figurative density (molecular bonds = relationships) is high without escalation. Sentence openings show variety, and no severe artifacts obscure causality, but the loops and conceptual redundancy in the closure section lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence recurs across multiple beats: "The vendor [verb]… The vendor [verb]… The vendor [verb]" in adjacent paragraphs, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("stories could not be rushed," then "stories began not in some mythical place" restates the search theme without added pressure). Stock metaphor strings—"crystalline fruits that pulsed with captured narratives," "essence of all tales"—cluster in the opening third without grounding in concrete action. Mixed vehicle: moonlight is both "harvested" and "bottled," then "humming," without coherent physical logic. These artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure sentence, so penalty remains in Q7 only. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle: paragraphs 6–7 restate Kael's gift and risk of submersion with synonym churn ("stored remorse," "emotionally contagious," "become subsumed") without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence in paragraphs 19–23: repeated "Kael [verb]" openers and "the stored remorse [verb]" constructions (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling") appear in peak beats (−0.4). Closure beat ("hands trembling but heart lighter") uses label-only emotion. Combined artifacts total −1.5; loops and cadence touch multiple paragraphs, justifying the cumulative deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: the opening two sentences restate the tower's importance, "silos both full and hearts empty" / "warehouse spaces...now sat silent" recycle the division concept, and "one note, one word, one bridge" is a mechanical list closer. Template cadence runs through expository blocks: "She [verb]" constructions dominate without variation. Stock metaphors ("beacon of history and hope," "beating heart of a revitalized community") and elevated diction ("hush of borrowed starlight" repeated) reduce specificity. Pivotal beats—the first gathering, the farmers' cooperation—are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence undermine momentum: "helix-minded" and variants appear six times, "entangled memories" five times, "quaking reverie" four times, "synaptic plasticity" three times, often within adjacent lines without added pressure. Metaphoric density is high but vehicles contradict ("spiraling like DNA strands," "underground rivers," "perfect helix") without coherent logic. Register drifts into pseudo-scientific abstraction ("synaptic plasticity," "resonant pathways") that clashes with the lyric frame. Information density is low—most sentences restate transformation claims rather than advancing action. Paragraph eight ("As dawn approached...") is a near-synonym loop of paragraph seven.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows without major opacity, but repetitive phrasing and template cadence weaken momentum: "prism-minded archivist" opens three paragraphs, "clandestinely luminous" recurs in identical contexts, and synonym loops ("forgotten combinations" / "seeds of vigilance") pad beats without advancing pressure. Key action ("As Elara worked through each puzzle") is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening the climax. Paraphrase loops (paragraphs restating Elara's mission) and stock metaphor strings ("latent blaze threatening to erupt," "enfolding mist") lower density. These artifacts do not obscure causality completely but dull closure impact, warranting a −0.8 deduction for pervasive template phrasing and summary substitution.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is generally high. Clarity and concision hold through most beats. Two frictions lower the score: (1) a paraphrase loop across adjacent lines in the crack-reading sequence ("Each crack was like a note... each pattern a melody" / "feeling the artist's intention through the wood's persistent memory" restates the same content), and (2) the final paragraph includes a minor template cadence ("The porcelain insulator hummed softly... already beginning the next translation"). No figurative muddle or major scaffold, but these loops dull momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "Elias was thoughtfully precise" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing, creating template cadence (−0.6). Synonym churn around "magnetic nexus at twilight" and "eclipsed covenant" feels scaffolded rather than voice-driven. Some figurative language—"the dent caught the last light"—works, but stacked modifiers ("hopeful melancholy," "resolute acceptance") in the final beats lean abstract. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate prior knowledge without advancing pressure. Clarity and grammar are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean but exhibits template cadence and synonym churn: "eclectic pacifist," "theatrical sincerity," "final stillness before fireworks" repeat without evolving meaning. Sentence stems recur ("The path to empathy," "The workshop had been," "The eclectic pacifist moved"). Metaphor density is high ("vibrational connections," "resonances between hearts," "frequency alignment") without concrete grounding, creating abstraction drag. The closing firework image is vivid but arrives as illustrative cap rather than propulsive closure beat. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but momentum sags under repeated abstract phrasing and paraphrase loops. "Serenity within motion" appears three times; "undercurrent of wisdom" twice; "wildflower hush" three times, each iteration restating rather than advancing pressure. Template cadence recurs: "Her [noun]... her [noun]... her [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb], [gerund clause]" patterns dominate paragraph openings. Figurative language ("whispers on the wind," "stars brought to earth") is stock rather than fresh. The moonlit-vigil beat—the story's climax—summarizes the seed's opening in one sentence without sensory or syntactic intensification. Information density is low; multiple sentences restate Elara's transformation without new detail.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and no major loops or scaffolding. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or action. Minor template cadence appears in the opening third ("His mission today was urgent," "The silence of the approaching hour whirled around him") and the phrase "whirling silence" recurs without evolving meaning, creating small tonal redundancy. Stock metaphors like "silver serpents" and "ancient resonance" add modest texture without muddle. No artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting deduction impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "rapidly adapting" appears three times, "singular convergence" twice, "hazy precision" twice, all as labels without dramatized pressure. Adjacent sentences restate the same content ("Her actions were deliberate" / "Her movements taking on a rhythm that bordered on meditative"). Stock metaphors accumulate without purpose ("towering labyrinth," "metal canyons"). Filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she continued," "she made her way") dull immediacy in high-information beats. The opening and closing paragraphs recycle the same thematic assertions without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting: figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed registers ("unfetter the potential energies," "doves from confinement," "blanket of serenity woven from starlight") blur clarity. Template cadence runs appear ("As she continued," "As the final sequence approached," "When her fingers struck") and paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "colors bloomed behind her eyes" / "each hue… sang its own secret melody"). The final third stacks metaphors ("lotus," "presence," "tears of joy") that obscure rather than sharpen the closure image. Apply −1.2 for density + coherence + cadence artifacts touching closure, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence runs pervade: "As a driven relic keeper... As a method for navigating... After the guardianship... After the guardianship's unexpected..." and "he had come here... he had studied... he had believed" create mechanical stems. Paraphrase loops cluster: "the weight of his recent failure" / "accusations and regret echoed endlessly" / "months of accumulated guilt" restate emotional summary without added pressure. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh inflection: "ancient stones," "delicate fabric," "sacred gift," "boundary manipulation." Filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("he had believed," "he understood," "he saw himself") dull immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes transformation in abstract language rather than concrete image, dulling the closure beat. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −1.4 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with moments of vivid specificity ("topaz-laden walls," "rhythmic clanking of the press"). However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "His sudden absent-minded examination... his unconscious adoption... his mouth forming words" stacks parallel possessives without variation, and "The halo fragment had been... Her research notebooks filled with... As dawn approached" repeats topical openings across adjacent paragraphs (−0.4 for template runs). Several paraphrase loops occur: "cryptic façade" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "emotions as variables" recurs without added pressure. Information density is uneven; the final two paragraphs summarize her philosophy rather than advancing scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs weaken propulsion: "The pendant had been created across the fade from memory to myth" echoes "Across the fade from memory to myth, her journey would continue" without added meaning; "vibrating sympathetically" appears five times as a refrain without evolving pressure; "absent mentor" is used three times in identical constructions. The final two paragraphs stack abstract summary ("wonder wasn't delivered to people—it was awakened within them") that stalls closure momentum. Filter-verb clusters ("began vibrating," "started to") and stock metaphors ("windows like fireflies") further dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "The quartz arbor in mist" recurs three times as filler; "attentive mystic" and "firmly grounded" echo without adding pressure. Template cadence dominates ("Elara [verb]" stems repeat across paragraphs). Stock metaphors ("chasing shadows," "doorway to understanding") and therapy-speak ("knew in her bones") cluster in the final third. Sentence openings lack variety; momentum stalls under summary exposition in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose features pervasive patterned artifacts: template cadence runs ("Each morning, as her loom stood idle…another sound would vanish"; "She had no map, no sense of direction—only the bead's steady glow"), synonym loops ("raveling silence," "profound quiet," "growing quiet," "perfect silence," "silence…all-encompassing"), and stock metaphors ("threads of undetectable sound," "tapestry of time"). Mixed metaphors appear: silence "ravels" (unweaves) yet also "stretches" and "deepens," and the bead "dimmed" then was "reborn" without clarifying its state. Register drifts into elevated diction ("latent possibility," "crystalline prison") that does not match the POV's idiom. Paraphrase loops blur momentum: the bead's guidance is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing knowledge. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("the bead reborn on her chest"), triggering the high-penalty routing (−1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "meek nature"/"meek in spirit," "determination…steady"/"determination unwavering," "abandoned mine shafts"/"mine shaft workshop," "floating arches"/"floating bridges," "defiance" recurring four times without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "His hands moved…his eyes seeing…" Adjacent sentences restate the same content ("Word spread…who could restore anything, who could make broken tools stronger"). The final paragraph is pure summary, listing outcomes rather than dramatizing a closure beat. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for closure-beat summary drag.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "half-remembered dreams"/"murmur of half-remembered dreams," "weight of a withheld truth" (repeated three times), "cyclically and spontaneous" (repeated twice identically). Template cadence: runs of "In [timeline], they…" structure across paragraphs 8–9. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "reality began to fray," "world dissolving into shimmering possibilities," "currents of possibility like seasoned sailors" in adjacent lines. Filter-verb stack in final third: "they sensed," "ready to finally redirect," "receded like." Apply −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template stems, and metaphor muddle; artifacts touch closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally maintained, but several artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "the lantern room was haunted" (paragraph 4) and "the supposedly haunted lantern room" (paragraph 18) restate without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The" + noun constructions in close succession (paragraphs 3, 9, 18, 22, 35). Stock metaphor: "white tower piercing the morning fog like a solitary promise" is functional but borrows familiar imagery. Filter-verb stack: "seemed to move," "smelled of," "something caught his eye" cluster in the discovery sequence. Applying −0.6 baseline for spread and −0.2 for paraphrase loop totals −0.8, with minor added pressure from the template runs. Information density is high in the discovery beats; the vial moment (paragraph 31) adds a beat that does little causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately, and no major grammatical errors appear. However, paraphrase loops and thematic echo undermine momentum: "shadowed elation" appears three times with identical phrasing; "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated twice; "glass lantern wick" is named four times in near-identical constructions. Template cadence clusters in the final third ("Tonight we reveal," "Tonight… we guide them home," "ready to steer yet another fleet"). The final paragraph contains a visible artifact—"unpredictable室白鲟 in its intonations"—that breaks legibility. These accumulate to a −1.2 deduction in Q7, and the artifact in a high-pressure beat disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language density is high but often strained: "valley-mist wonder," "sun trails of human connection," "moths to his newly illuminated understanding." Mixed metaphors abound ("iron filings dancing," "dust, dew, sunlight captured through prisms" as a narrative dye). Template cadence runs appear in the opening moves ("His workshop floated…His method had become…His journals were filled…"). Paraphrase loops recur (paragraphs restating Kaelen's research without advancing pressure). The final third summarizes future events rather than dramatizing the present beat, flattening momentum. Artifact penalties accumulate: −0.6 for template cadence, −0.4 for figurative muddle in peak beats, −0.3 for paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no template cadence runs. Clarity is generally maintained, though some constructions are overwrought: "沉默地 held truths" (appears to be a stray character artifact), "swirling like liquid mercury," "silver serenity." The climactic beat stacks figurative language without clear pattern payoff: moonlight "flared," lenses "swirling," understanding "washed over," instrument "glowing," all within two sentences. Paraphrase loop: "quantified sorrow" and "units of lost hope or unresolved grief" restate the same concept adjacently. Information density is moderate; some scaffold ("his true motivation, however, burned deeper") delays the turn. Propulsion adequate but dulled by explanatory layering in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: paragraphs 3–4 restate fragmented memories and the unraveling without advancing pressure; paragraphs 9–10 repeat the idea that woven dawns require care/songs. Template cadence: "This was the method…" (¶7), "This was how the realm…" (¶11), "This was their purpose…" (¶23) form a three-instance stem run without taught pattern. Figurative density is high throughout ("mirror world," "phosphorescent flora," "condensed starlight") but mixed metaphors appear: "bound release" (¶13, 16, 25) conflates constraint with liberation without clarifying the paradox on the page. Apply −0.6 baseline for paraphrase + template + metaphoric muddle, and −0.3 for three-instance stem run, totaling −0.9 in Q7. The closure beat ("bound by responsibility yet released by fulfillment") repeats the phrase without embodying its contradiction, dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences restate Eleanor's internal contradiction without adding pressure ("compassionate nature could exist alongside her reclusive tendencies," "compassionate heart at peace with her reclusive soul," "keenly empathetic yet comfortably alone"). Figurative language ("nestled paradoxes," "enlarged tranquility") is repeated across the piece without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Stock metaphors ("racing thoughts," "sense of peace settle over her") dull peak beats. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence runs; additional −0.3 for repeated stock metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose carries moderate clarity but suffers from paraphrase loops ("After the birds flew south" opens and closes; "creeping normality noticer" and "her particular sensitivity to lost things" restate the same trait). Template cadence appears in repeated "After..." and "The..." openers across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("testament to nature's persistence," "hidden in plain sight") and elevated diction ("tenuous absolution," "guerrilla gardening") cluster in reflective beats, creating minor register drift. Figurative density is moderate but not overloaded. Artifact penalty (−0.6) applied for loops and template stems touching multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 18 and 29 restate Elias's motivation nearly verbatim ("while illusions faded," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"); paragraphs 7 and 16 echo the measurement method without added detail. Template cadence in paragraphs 2–4 ("His name was… The library… He was…") flattens propulsion. Stock phrases—"pulse in response," "holding its breath," "surge of hope"—dull specificity. Clarity and grammar are clean, but information density is low: many sentences restate prior content rather than advancing knowledge or pressure. No figurative muddle, but accumulated scaffold drags momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies purposefully and clarity is high; spatial choreography (tavern corner, barrels, back room, door) tracks cleanly. The piece suffers from mild paraphrase loops: "curiously steadfast in her mission" echoes "curiously steadfast in her pursuit"; "the sound of betrayal was safely contained within the antique watch fob" repeats the capture already shown. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she observed," "she watched") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent and do not obscure immediacy. The final paragraph stacks summary ("succeeded where others would have failed," "the uncatchable," "comforting unease of her unique collection") where a concrete image would sharpen closure, triggering a minor line-level deduction for thematic echo and summary opacity at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "luminous quality...intensified" / "luminous skeptic, no longer skeptical" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through numerous lines ("Their research...their natural skepticism...their tongue tasted..."). Stock metaphors ("storm cloud in human form," "voice like distant thunder") flatten specificity. Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density overload. Final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language or compound metaphor without breathing room. "Melodies of discovery," "luminous regret," "auroral sorrow," "tumblers in his creative spirit," and "warehouse of empty canvases" stack without causal linkage. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 9–10 restate the broken-lock metaphor in adjacent beats. Template cadence in the opening third ("charcoal-fingered," "mnemonically gifted," "subterranean crystal cathedral") reads like keyword insertion. Register drift and mixed metaphors ("combination lock" as creative block, "uncork suppressed creativity") reduce clarity at closure. Information density is low; many sentences do one job only.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is clean and syntactically varied with few technical errors. However, paraphrase loops appear: the final three paragraphs restate her resolve and thematic insight with synonym churn ("courage to remain truthful in each moment, each word, each breath"; "each moment, each word, each breath"). Template cadence in backstory exposition ("This reaction had cost her...who had departed") and scaffold phrasing ("more importantly, the path was marked") reduce density. Stock metaphors ("botanical life raft," "like a puzzle finally making sense") don't obscure causality but dull the line-level texture in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.3)
    Clarity is adequate, but momentum sags under summary scaffolding: "For weeks, she worked... In time, others began building... Elara grew old..." compresses pivotal beats that warrant scene. Paraphrase loops touch several passages—"symphonies of truth" appears four times without evolving function; "color of wonder" and "kinetic sculpture" recur as labels rather than charged images. Template cadence appears in the final third: "When travelers ascended... they would often find... The kinetic sculpture continued to glisten..." Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; many lines narrate elapsed time rather than advance on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.9)
    "Strangely organic" appears four times without variation, a clear paraphrase loop. Multiple paragraphs begin with "The" or "Unit 734" in adjacent lines, creating template cadence. "Systems failure imminent" and "controlled burn escape" read as placeholder labels rather than motivated diction. Figurative language ("electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is moderate; some sentences like "The android's fingers traced the polished surface..." advance setup but do not do double duty. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, total −0.7 applied once here.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence pervades: "Through neighborhood storytelling" appears three times, "aged locket" twice, "vibrant courtyard at dawn" twice, each in identical syntactic slots. Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 11–12 ("Leo began to hear more… Every day at dawn brought new revelations"). Stock metaphors ("thread of curiosity," "rising sun," "morning light painted") and therapy-speak ("listening heals") appear in peak beats without embodiment. The final paragraph stacks summary assertions rather than propelling image. Artifacts touch the closure beat; baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose contains multiple paraphrase loops and template patterns: "mysterious familiarity" appears three times with identical phrasing; "explains through dance" / "explained through dance" repeats across paragraphs; "as a spider spins its web" appears three times in near-identical constructions. Sentence openings show variety, but information density is low—many lines restate concepts ("The mysterious familiarity of this ritual comforted her, as if she were remembering something she had always known"). The final two paragraphs summarize outcomes rather than dramatizing closure, creating momentum drag. Figurative language is generally clear, though the spider-web simile becomes strained through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. "Gleaming silence" recurs as a motif, but several template cadences appear: "She believed...just as she believed," "The chamber amplified...making them visible," "She gathered her tools and made her way." Paraphrase loop in the crystal discovery beat: "fragments of memories...dancing" immediately followed by "images moving—fragments of memories." The final third stacks filter verbs and summary ("she understood now," "she knew she couldn't") where scene pressure would serve better. Information density is moderate; some beats do double work, but scaffold remains.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "quiet brook" appears six times, "solitary summoner" four times, and "terrestrially cosmic" three times within ~730 words, often in identical syntactic slots. Sentences recycle stems ("The origami wing...," "The summoner...") and restate content without added pressure—e.g., paragraphs 4 and 18 both describe the "smoothed hush" spreading outward with near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphors ("moonlight weaving silver," "water flowing...like blood through veins") and elevated diction clashes ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially balanced energies") obscure rather than clarify. Filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying the artifact penalty pack (−1.4 baseline for spread, plus −0.3 for final-third presence) and paraphrase-loop deductions yields this score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence openings and no grammatical errors. Minor paraphrase loop: "mysterious familiarity" is restated as "they were distant relatives, connected by a lineage" without additional pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the middle: "Each Tuesday, they'd sit… Mr. Abernathy would demonstrate… Clara would share…" cycles through three parallel stems without variation (−0.4). Figurative language ("meteors… ephemeral as forgotten words") is apt but sparse. Information density is moderate; several transit summaries ("following week found her returning") compress efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "charmed skepticism...believing only in what she could measure yet forever ensnared by the world's inexplicable beauty" rephrases the opening label. Template cadence: "The shell murmured...The velvet garden seemed...The ghostly resolve..." creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("waves on distant shores," "burden of containing what others could not bear") lack fresh texture. Purple-prose density in high-pressure beats ("tragically radiant with eyes that held the sorrow of forgotten civilizations") obscures rather than propels. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally adequate, but several prose artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "unlink himself from the consequences" restated as "unlinking himself from the chains of guilt." Template cadence runs in the middle third with repeated "Elias [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Stock phrases—"weight of decades," "pearl twilight," "heritage rose thorn"—recur without evolving meaning. Mixed metaphor: the key "with no apparent lock" dissolves into light merging with the aurora, blurring its physical logic. These issues dull momentum but do not obscure causality at closure, so penalties remain moderate per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "webs of intrigue" appears five times with synonym churn ("tapestry of existence," "ensnared"). Template cadence runs dominate mid-story ("She was richly perceptive… Her purpose was clear… The method she employed…"). Stock phrases cluster without fresh vehicle ("serpentine nexus," "star patterns shifted," "cosmic harmony"). The closure beat—"light that was neither star nor sun"—relies on strained negative construction instead of concrete image. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure lines ("she began to understand," "she sensed"), dulling immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase/synonym loops, template cadence, stock metaphor strings = baseline −1.2 in Q7; artifacts touch closure = escalate to −1.7 total.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "descended… cutting through darkness" / "ghost whisperer… felt the lingering presence" / "salvage something pure from the wreckage" recurs three times verbatim. Synonym churn on "salvage/expose/reveal" and "windows of connection" without added pressure. Stock metaphor strings: "borrowed starlight" (three uses), "weaving truth carefully" (two uses), both without reweighting. The final two paragraphs stack summary and thematic echo without propulsion. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she learned," "she knew") in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy. Mid-story compression ("Night after night… piecing together a pattern") summarizes what should drive escalation, creating a momentum sinkhole. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("salvaged what was pure"), triggering disqualification per the Text-Artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in passages describing the nets and moon paths. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the concept of hidden patterns is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. The final section contains scaffold sentences that summarize rather than dramatize: "The patterns he had witnessed could not be owned or explained, only appreciated" echoes earlier claims. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "He would" constructions. No severe artifacts touch closure, but momentum sags in the contemplative sections.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "sharply observant eyes" / "sharply observant nature" / "sharply observant mind"; "hidden stillpoint" appears five times with minimal variation; "the letters" / "reassembling shredded letters" / "by reassembling shredded letters" churn without added detail. Template cadence runs throughout: "The locals whispered... yet the orchard," "The letters spoke... By reassembling," "The liquidation hadn't been... Corporate scientists had." Stock phrases dominate: "impossibly perfect," "relentless pursuit of truth," "fate worse than liquidation." Information density is low—many sentences restate the same revelation. These artifacts spread across the text and touch the closure beats, applying the maximum scaffold penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles: "Throughout his self-imposed exile, Elias had constructed his purpose" / "His motivation burned constant: to shape a new dawn"; "transmissions" / "frequencies" / "messages" churn without added pressure. Template stems ("Elias spent...," "Elias understood...," "Elias told...") recur across six sentences. Stock metaphors ("ancient shadows," "dawn...breaking") and filter-verb stacks ("had discovered," "had constructed," "had documented") dull immediacy. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks = baseline ~4.7 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear but carries overwriting in high-pressure beats: "hauntingly familiar yet entirely new, speaking a language he felt he should understand but couldn't quite name" stacks modifiers without advancing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("he had discovered a home… a richness far beyond monetary wealth"). Template cadence is mild. Rhythm varies, but density is uneven—key beats expand with figurative language while pivotal actions compress into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm accelerates during the approach sequence. Clarity is high; no pronoun drift or tense errors. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "logically emotional" appears twice in similar framing, "crypt keeper's key" is repeated in near-identical descriptive clauses across paragraphs, and "azure coat" recurs four times as a visual tag without functional variation. Template cadence in the ritual climax (orb pulsed, tuning fork resonated, key glowed, tone echoed) stacks actions without advancing tension. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull line-level propulsion. Information density is moderate; several sentences serve only as scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and vivid figurative language ("polished obsidian mirror," "wind in haunting melodies"). However, repetitive conceptual loops appear: "patient revolution" and "unyoke" recur without added pressure, and scaffold phrasing like "the mapper knew," "the mapper had discovered," "the mapper began to chart" creates template cadence across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors ("sculpting patience," "web of patience being woven") blur coherence. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate the revolution's method without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is adequate, but the prose carries repetitive conceptual loops: "fortified vulnerability" appears twice, "controlling influence" three times, "watchfully calm" twice, all as scaffold labels. The final paragraph stacks metaphoric declarations—"reverberate beyond this case," "transform into something stronger," "merging into a single purpose"—without concrete action. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "Her grandmother's stories, the small family museum back home, the connection to ancestors" and "photographing patterns...water displacement levels...fibers of fabric" list without syntactic variation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "seemed") cluster in the middle section but do not stack densely enough to trigger the full artifact penalty. Paraphrase loop: "ending not just this investigation but also the controlling influence" restates the theme already declared two sentences prior.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean and largely rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, scaffold phrases recur: "the weight of his decision settling upon him," "the sound of music boxes playing in harmony followed him," and "their melodies combining in a vibrant hush" feel like decorative capstones rather than propulsive images. The line "By the way light broke through storm clouds outside" awkwardly echoes the required Method element without clear causal function. No major loops or filter stacks appear, but information density is moderate, with some beats restating content ("justice had been served in the only way that matters now" paraphrases the prior house-purchase revelation).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies across paragraphs. However, pervasive synonym loops and template cadence weaken propulsion: "steadily curious" appears four times, "yearning algorithm" five times, and "irreverent awe" twice, often in stock phrases ("The glider's steadily curious nature," "The yearning algorithm surged"). Opening stems repeat mechanically ("The glider [verb]," "It [verb]"). The final third recycles concepts (evolution, seeking, bell) without advancing pressure. Figurative language ("peeling back layers of computational reserve") mixes registers. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence across multiple beats, plus −0.3 for synonym churn touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "deleted files went nowhere—they went everywhere, hidden in the archive's deepest recesses, protected by digital labyrinth" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in multiple beats: "Being brightly attentive... she noticed," "The recurring numbers... appeared," "The sense of absence grew stronger." Stock metaphor strings ("whispers from another dimension," "constellations in a dark sky," "ghosts in the machine") cluster without fresh vehicles. Register drift into elevated diction ("doomed spaceship," "symphony half-remembered from a dream") clashes with the thriller frame. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax paragraph without coherence: "burning a hole in her memory," "echo like forgotten songs," "archive of human experience" stack without clear tenor-vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "understanding into tangible results" / "empathy could indeed manifest as action, that understanding could transform the physical world"; "the crystal reconstituted" / "reconstitution"; "the weighted breath before reply" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "Each reflective surface offered…" "Each reflection had shown…" "Each glimpse contributing…" Stock metaphors stack without fresh inflection: "like nets capturing fireflies," "like ink in water," "as if it had a mind of its own." Filter verbs ("she knew," "she pictured," "she focused") cluster in the reconstitution beat, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than closes with image: "a testament to mapping empathy onto action" is a thesis statement, not a concrete ending.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "ending"/"beginnings" churn across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and the parasol tip is described identically in multiple beats. Template cadence ("She [verb]," "Elena [verb]") runs for six consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphors ("precious stone," "bridge to the future") replace concrete action. The final paragraph stacks three summarizing epiphanies that restate the same realization, triggering −0.8 for loops and −0.4 for scaffold. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "Drawing parallels" recurs five times with near-identical phrasing; "After the final bus departed the vacant station" appears three times; "burned love letter edge" is repeated verbatim across beats without reweighting. Runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems create rhythmic monotony. Filter-verb stacks ("began to see," "thought he'd lost," "had become") dull immediacy in reflective beats. Stock metaphors ("bloomed like the vines in spring," "painted the world in warm tones") and synonym churn ("gentle persuasion" variants) reduce density. These artifacts touch every third of the story, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "murmuring pavilion" appears six times, "kinetic parapet" five, "peripheral awareness" four, "conjured clearing" six—each repetition restates presence without adding pressure. Template cadence: "The line walker [verb]" opens eight sentences. Figurative language is stock ("eyes that saw between worlds," "truth could grow wild like flowers"). Sentence variety is low; most paragraphs begin with the subject. Heavy scaffolding across the piece triggers cumulative −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "decay and renewal" is restated as "less like a symbol of decay and more like a reminder of resilience"; "transmute pain" echoes "transformation of pain"; "another piece of the great puzzle had been solved" reprises the opening "subtle puzzle archivist." Template cadence runs through the middle third: "The lavender swayed..."; "Elara's fingers traced..."; "She had discovered..."; "Now, as vines climbed..." Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "pulse with energy," "beacon," "tapestry," "web of understanding." Register drifts into abstract diction ("collective healing," "earnest whimsy") that distances the reader from immediate action. Sentence openings repeat structural patterns. Combined artifacts warrant −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "fractured sequences" appears four times, "suspended hush" three times, "weathered innocence" four times, "testify through fractured sequences" twice, creating synonym churn that dulls momentum (−0.8). Template cadence runs ("The scholar…" as sentence opener appears six times in close succession) further flatten rhythm (−0.4). Figurative language in most sentences of the opening third (dust motes, slanted light, suspended hush, silence thick enough to touch) reads as density without payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate the scholar's reverence or the library's atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and avoids mechanical templates, though several lines lean on abstract nouns and elevated diction ("tidal longing," "melody of time passing") that flatten momentum in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn are evident. The opening and closing both feature "arranging driftwood as directional markers," which reads as purposeful bookending rather than accidental repetition. Clarity is generally high, with clean grammar and spatial coherence. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (e.g., "Those tapes contained voices long silent, faces kept young despite the passage of time" anchors backstory and desire), but others merely restate mood without advancing plot.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "luminous ache" appears three times, "changelessly constant" twice, "ephemeral" recurs without adding pressure. Abstract nouns cluster heavily ("precision," "meditation," "recognition," "alignment," "resonance," "profundity"). The spinning hand is described multiple ways (ceaseless rotation, furious hand, spinning hand) with synonym churn rather than fresh detail. Figurative language is dense in contemplative passages ("speak in whispers," "ocean of darkness," "leathered the boundaries") without on-page payoff in choice. Scaffold phrases like "the realization unfolded" and "causing an ache of recognition" tell state rather than showing through action. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate theme without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    Phrasing recurs without escalation: "radiant haven above the clouds" appears three times; "pulsing stillness" twice; "scent of hope" twice—all with minimal reweighting. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions ("When the Anders family arrives," "When Mr. Anders finally closes his eyes"). Stock metaphors ("holy relic," "ordinary magic") and therapy-speak ("reunification," "transition spaces") cluster in peak beats. The penultimate paragraph stacks abstractions ("ordinary magic," "call this goodbye flawless in its imperfection") that dull the closure image. Line-level artifacts measurably flatten the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Budding rune scholar" appears four times, "clockwork automaton key" five times with identical phrasing, creating a labeling tic. Adjacent sentences restate content: "The clockwork automaton key had been her grandmother's last gift" / "The key was said to unlock…"; "light erupted" / "the observatory filled with blinding light." Opening stems recur mechanically: "The budding…," "The clockwork…," "The shadows…" Figurative language is stock ("heart raced," "consuming mystery," "bridge to another realm") and lacks specificity under the POV's lens. Information density is low; many lines scaffold rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image well. However, several artifact patterns reduce density: paraphrase loops ("Eleanor had always been a forgiving skeptic" → "With her shrewdly innocent approach"), stock metaphors (firefly light, perpetual twilight), and scaffolding phrases ("As Eleanor navigated," "With her shrewdly innocent approach," "As their hands joined"). Template cadence in Arthur's dialogue ("My Ellie" → "Building" → "My bones need setting") and synonym churn around "impossible" (extraordinary, peculiar, impossible ×3) lower information density. Deduct −0.8 for patterned artifacts clustered across beats but not touching closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is solid and spatial choreography tracks, but template cadence runs appear: "Her motivation to share...had grown stronger" / "Fire destroyed; she sought to illuminate" / "Along the shore...she collected" / "Back in her small workshop" loop through boilerplate openers across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: "dreams of distant worlds and impossible journeys" echoes "dreams to ash" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("gift from the depths," "patient hands," "pulse of the universe") and filter-verb stacks ("would climb," "would weigh," "would transform") in ritual description dull immediacy. Applying template-cadence (−0.4), paraphrase-loop (−0.2), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) penalties totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple line-level artifacts accumulate across the piece. Template cadence runs: "Her fingers absently traced... / The watchful dreamer—that's what Dr. Aris had called her... / She was quietly proactive... / Earlier that morning, she had noticed..." (four consecutive paragraph-opening "Her/She" stems in the first third). Paraphrase loops: "honeyed hush" appears three times with nearly identical function; "watchful dreamer" is explained twice. Stock metaphor strings: "fertile ground," "walking on eggshells," "rock the boat that needed capsizing." Elevated diction clashes with embodied perception in peak beats ("proffered," "catalyst," "reclaimed integrity"). Filter-verb stack in the final third: "she felt the viral confession release... she felt... she had learned... she turned." Per artifact penalty pack, these issues trigger −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "whisper of closing pages" / "inside the whisper of closing pages," "lucidly watchful" repeated identically across paragraphs, "ephemeral cameo appearances" x3, "against the current" x3, "shapes of different hopes" x3, "feral nexus in mist" x5. Template cadence dominates with runs of "The [noun] [past tense verb]" and "he had [past perfect]" stems. Stock metaphors ("swirling hush," "delicate mathematical geometry," "sacred reverence") flatten texture. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening sense. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("swirling hush grew louder"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "spun golden stories" appears three times with minimal variation; "verdant arbor" and "gathering hush" recur as anchors without reweighting. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "golden light," "luminescence," "magical," "ancient and new" stack in rapid succession. Filter verbs cluster in peak beats: "felt a strange pull," "noticed something unusual," "seemed both ancient and new." Apply −1.2 for loops and filter stacks. Sentence openings often begin with "The" or "Elara," creating rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound but exhibits pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences restate patience and deliberateness: "worked with deliberate slowness," "moved with practiced grace," "slow, deliberate gestures," "holding each position for long minutes." Paragraph-level redundancy: the pattern's importance is declared three times without new information. Stock phrases proliferate: "skeletal fingers," "ancient pulse," "pregnant with possibility," "ripple across the ages." Information density is low; many lines describe atmosphere without advancing situation. Filter-verb stacks in the final third ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to hold") dull immediacy. Several beats could be cut without changing knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Days turned to weeks as Elara meticulously mapped…understanding growing not in a rush but in the accumulation of small revelations" recycles prior summary without new pressure. Multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "As [subject] [verb]" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster: "dust on the ancient cavern floor," "morning mist," "tide of forgetting." Figurative density in non-peak beats (the entire middle) approaches 70% without pattern teaching (−1.2 cumulative in Q7). Artifacts touch closure: "wonder stored where reason could keep it safe" is abstraction replacing image (−1.7 total, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "boundary-lessly trapped" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and "shingled hush" recurs as decoration rather than function. Figurative language is dense—"fractal weaver," "whalebone reverie," "calcified into stone"—but often vague, lacking concrete anchors. Template cadence emerges in the burden-collection sequence: "This one belonged to… its weight was…" repeated without variation. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("that was the nature of their calling") that dull momentum rather than propelling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied rhythm and strong sensory anchors. However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "rain-beaded skylight" recurs three times, "hauntingly practical" and "rust-hued peace" function as label shortcuts rather than dramatized states, and "crystallized time" appears twice without clarifying its mechanism. Template cadence in paragraph five: "The loft itself was…yet nothing remained…a paradox she inhabited" stacks abstract claims. The kettle framing is invoked but never propels a sentence-level choice. Figurative density ("fractured light," "tiny prism," "crystallized pocket," "constellations") competes for attention in high-pressure beats. Deduction: −0.6 for density and label reliance, −0.4 for template phrasing = baseline ~7.9, adjusted to 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks modifiers and metaphorical language ("iridescent debris," "magnificent, haunting music," "translucent, shimmering hands") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5 to −0.7. Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "eroded ambitions" is restated as "dreams had settled like silt" and later "eroded ambitions mirrored perfectly in the spirit's transparent form." Template cadence runs through the middle section with repetitive "His/The" sentence openers and parallel constructions. Stock metaphors (silt, morning dew, bridge of words) lack specificity. Elevated diction ("priceless collection," "sacred purpose") clashes with the urgency of Cyrus's quest.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "maze of intentions" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "stoic" paired with "determination" and "wonder" recurs as a label rather than embodied state; "redirected flows" and "resurrect" are repeated without deepening. Template cadence: "She moved… She reached… She pulled… She began…" structures several beats identically. Stock metaphors abound: "sleeping giants," "stars awakening in an evening sky," "ghosts of journeys past." The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("equation for hope," "course toward the future") that dilute rather than sharpen the final image. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template stems; −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats totaling −1.2, with artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence appears across multiple paragraphs: "Elias [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]," "As [clause], [result]" recur without variation, creating a drumbeat rhythm that flattens momentum (−0.5). Paraphrase loops are present: "no longer burdened" / "embracing it with new eyes," "soundless sanctuary" repeated without added pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors ("gears turn in his mind," "rain after drought") and the phrase "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times without evolution (−0.2). Information density is moderate; several beats restate the transformation rather than advance it. Figurative language ("glacial hush," "crystal whispering") is vivid but appears in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "by training instincts honed through years" echoes "By training instincts that had once led her"; "The silence of morning radio" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "Elara [verb], her [noun]…" structures repeat across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("dark ribbon," "breadcrumbs of truth") and elevated diction ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval") clutter high-pressure moments without voice motivation. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("With the antique pocket sundial as her guide and the journal as her map"), dulling propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for stock phrasing = baseline −1.3; artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high; grammar and tense are clean. Information density is low: many sentences restate atmosphere or assert interiority without advancing situation. Paraphrase loops surface: "the fog thickened" / "fog completely enveloped"; "understanding" / "realized"; "reverence" / "grateful." Recycled stems appear across beats: "The seed collector [verb]" × 4, "The fisherman [verb]" × 3, creating template cadence. Figurative language is functional but borders on stock: "rough as driftwood," "Lightning captured in sand," "oceanic hush." The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("infinitely patient," "infinitely grateful," "ancient wisdom") where concrete image would charge closure. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; −0.3 for closure-beat abstraction: combined −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrasing across beats: "shadowed garden" appears six times, "weft thread" and "palace carpet" recur without functional variance. Paraphrase loops in the final third restate the same transformation ("writing for the living," "life left to live") without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but generic ("spirits preparing for winter," "river of explanations"). Template cadence in the closing paragraph: "He was the traveler who... but in this moment, he was finally beginning to..." Applying −0.8 for loops and scaffold that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and the prose is generally clear, but several patterns recur: "The prince [verb]," "Elorian [verb]," and "The egg [verb]" across multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence. Line-level clarity is adequate yet information density is modest—many sentences restate the same fact ("hypothesizing about everything" appears three times in slightly different form; "beauty" recurs fifteen times without fresh angles). Stock metaphors ("quaking structure amplifying his reverie," "bitter sweetness") and near-paraphrase loops (e.g., two adjacent sentences explaining the assembly's purpose) reduce propulsion. The final paragraph summary ("He would find a way...even if it meant dismantling") tells future intent rather than ending on image or immediate action, weakening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "scars can sing" appears five times, "gracefully alert" twice, "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" four times, "migration of clouds" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs appear in reflective beats ("She touched… she whispered… she collected"). Figurative language is dense ("kelp-drift peace," "scars need protection to sing") but mixed and ornamental rather than propelling action. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems, escalated to −1.4 because they recur in the final third and dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "hair catching light like a luminous skeptic" anthropomorphizes a metaphor vehicle, and "defiant hush" is recycled without fresh charge. Template cadence runs throughout ("She was searching," "She could picture," "She imagined," "She whispered") with identical sentence stems. Paraphrase loops appear (breadcrumbs described three times in adjacent paragraphs as glints, patterns, and song). "的记忆 Keepers" is a typographic artifact. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("The city remembered, and in its remembering…") rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "approximating infinity" appears five times with identical phrasing; "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" recurs four times without variation. Template cadence dominates ("The sentimentalist…"; "The calculating machine gear…"; "The sonar pinging…"), creating syntactic monotony. Stock metaphors ("like stardust," "like tears," "like fractals") accumulate without fresh embodiment. Information density is low; many sentences restate the mission or describe repetitive actions (sonar pinging, gear spinning) without advancing pressure. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and stems, escalated to −1.4 for spread across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops appear frequently: "The spectral mentor had taught him…" followed by "The spectral mentorship had begun…"; "thundering calm" recurs four times without evolving meaning; "woven ribbon" appears in nearly identical constructions across paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "dust motes dancing above his workbench like unsettled spirits," "dusk fell in soft layers," "amber wings catching the last light." Register drift into abstract diction ("collective grief," "approach to life's inevitable losses") clashes with the tactile opening. The typo "Thecompleted" and the missing article ("to honor not a single life") are copy errors.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries significant line-level debt. Paraphrase loops appear: "he had served time while ignoring the community it served" and "restore the shared balance...restore what we broke" recycle concepts. Template cadence runs through the middle: "The clock tower stood...Alaric understood...Alaric placed..." across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors abound—"sunset painted," "bathed in golden light," "carved into his heart"—without fresh specificity. "沉重的" in the opening line is a bracket artifact or encoding error that harms clarity. The final third is especially dense with summary-tell ("Throughout the afternoon, incremental absolution wove itself") and thematic echo ("precision alone could never..."). Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Apply baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence, escalate to −1.2 for metaphor strings and stock openers, and add −0.3 for the opening artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or the ritual. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops and template cadence in several sequences: "He never felt alone...the voices of the past became almost audible" restates the connection theme without added pressure; "The velveteen gloom...seemed to deepen" / "The velveteen gloom...now felt protective" recycles the motif without new function. The final three paragraphs loop through thematic summary ("some truths were meant to remain guarded," "love...was the most persistent echo," "uncharted echoes that only he could hear") rather than trusting the image to close. These artifacts dull the closure beat and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty. Clarity and syntax are otherwise clean, with no grammatical or continuity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "predictive modeling" appears five times, "transformation" / "transformative" recurs across adjacent paragraphs, and several sentences restate Elara's past accuracy without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]" or "[Elara's trait]." The kingfisher quill is described as shimmering, capturing light, hovering—three ornamental beats without causal work. Figurative language ("dark tooth," "illuminate the blank page before it even touched it") stacks without coherence. Scaffold phrases like "her purpose was clear" and "with quiet determination" pad rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her fingers stained with ink" / "her fingers moved across," "stories should flow freely" / "stories return to people's lives" / "narratives were rationed" / "diverse narratives." Template cadence appears in the backstory paragraphs with repeated "The [noun] had [verb]" constructions. Stock phrases accumulate: "simple yet profound," "quiet revolution," "color and meaning." The second half is pure tell-mode summary that stalls all momentum. Figurative language ("thistled calm," "ember alcove") is decorative rather than functional. Multiple −0.3 to −0.4 deductions for loops and template stems.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster heavily: "weaves truth carefully" appears three times; "mirage of safety" twice in close succession; "incomplete information" and "questions turned solid" are restated without new pressure. Template stems recur: "Elena [verb], [gerund]" across multiple paragraphs. Figurative language (vanishing point, mirage, ash-scatter cycle) is dense but mixed—metaphors do not cohere. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.9)
    Persistent template cadence and paraphrase loops degrade momentum: "sedimentary layers" appears six times, often in near-identical phrasing; "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm" are recycled without variation; paragraphs 22–24 loop the same preservation claim.句stems repeat mechanically ("Milo's fingers," "The wannabe philosopher," "The journey back through sedimentary layers"). Heavy use of abstract nominalization ("competing narratives," "collective forgetting," "respectful compilation") replaces concrete action. The prose is grammatically clean but reads as scaffold-heavy exposition that tells rather than dramatizes Milo's internal conflict, particularly in the pivotal "agonize" beat (paragraph 9) which summarizes rather than enacts the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops pervade the text: "through months of practice" and "across unlearning hatred" recur as transit clichés; "expectantly resigned" appears three times without variation. Template cadence runs dominate ("Eleanor believed... Eleanor taught... Eleanor explained"). Figurative language ("traveled stillness," "braiding voices") is stock and muddy, triggering overwriting penalties. The final third is purely expository summary, flattening all momentum. Combined artifacts and loops justify −1.4 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for final-third scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraph 10 restates gift-and-burden, paragraph 22 echoes synaptic plasticity from 11, and paragraphs 9 and 23 both declare "create something beautiful from the ruins." Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs with identical "The [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh angle: "dust motes dancing," "spark of life," "gentle rebellion" (repeated thrice). Figurative density in the celestial-alignment beats blurs causality. Combined artifacts touch closure (final paragraph loops "gentle rebellion"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clear and grammatically clean with no major loops or template cadence. Information density is adequate; most lines advance situation or exposition. However, thematic phrases recur without added pressure: "preserve wonder in routine" appears three times in similar frames, and "nectar dusk" bookends without functional charge. The final paragraph—"involuntary honesty finally serving as a bridge between wonder and routine, truth and hope"—stacks abstract nouns where a concrete image would land harder. No dense figurative muddle or filter-verb stacks, but propulsion slackens in expository beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "streetlights daydreamed" (repeated four times), "shard of hush," "hushed blaze," "inadvertently profound," "sanctify" (three times), "breathed with life" (twice). Mixed metaphor: "hushed blaze" contradicts itself without resolving into coherent image. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "She would continue... she would continue... through... while..." Paraphrase loop: final two sentences restate the same thematic point. Information density is low in the closing paragraph, which recapitulates rather than advancing. Sentence openings vary; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean but burdened by repetitive sentence stems ("The statue…," "The diver…") and synonym churn (e.g., "understanding," "wisdom," "knowledge," "truth" cycle without added pressure). Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "thread the truth through the structural weakness," "currents of doubt," "tapestry," "layers of sediment"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "watched") stack in high-information beats. Information density is low; many lines restate the theme without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "His balancedly daring nature had served him well... His balancedly daring approach meant testing each hypothesis... His balancedly daring nature had finally paid off." Synonym churn recycles "grim optimism" across five iterations. Stock metaphors ("sound like shattering glass," "ready to embrace whatever came next") and therapy-speak labels ("genuine hope," "emotional flatlining") dull peak moments. The mathematical proofs remain abstract gesture—no concrete equation or breakthrough moment is dramatized. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "smog-choked city" appears five times, "moon-tipped brush" four times, "methodically hopeful" and "saffron quiet" are repeated without reweighting. Paragraph 10 restates paragraph 9's thesis with synonym churn ("strangers remember kindness" / "no one was truly alone"). Figurative language stacks without pressure: "tributaries of a great river," "resurrection of someone's long-forgotten expression," "tapestry of linguistic connection." Sentence stems cluster ("The painter was," "The brush moved," "She saw faces"). Cumulative artifact penalty and loop penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.6)
    Opening and closing images are vivid, but mid-story beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "the hive-mind consciousness… fading, leaving the displaced persons adrift" is immediately restated as "their unique expressions fraying at the edges." Template cadence appears in the guide's movement ("He moved past them… towards a cavern section") and Khira's shaping sequence. Purple clusters slow peak moments: "sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater" and "emerald light flaring briefly within the lens as the cultural bound within the bread reawakened" stack modifiers without clarity gain. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems, escalated to −1.0 for metaphor muddle in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "bleak exhilaration" recurs without deepening, "neatly inventive" is repeated identically, and scaffold phrasing ("seemed to," "as if") dilutes immediacy. Lines such as "a sound like grinding stone but something more too" and "ancient or newly born" gesture vaguely instead of specifying. The piece runs through a checklist of required elements—"counter clockwise," "hunger stone," "latent radiance," "yoyo," "reverse-engineering"—in declarative summary rather than weaving them into causally advancing beats. Mixed metaphors: "fabric of possibility and certainty" and "tapestry of fate" operate as interchangeable abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "lingering luminance" appears eight times with minimal variation, "whispering advisor" recurs as a tag without subtext, and the final five paragraphs restate transformation via synonym ("crumble away," "dissolve," "disperse," "complete"). Template cadence: "I [verb]" sentence stems dominate the second half. Mixed metaphor: luminance "coalesced around" the clasp then "spread through my veins" defying spatial logic. Stock phrases: "sickly, beautiful light," "pure light," "strange new existence." The ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure beat, and "repulsive allure" in the penultimate line is told as theme rather than shown in image. Artifacts touch the closure unit; disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory imagery is concrete in places ("mercury," "worn wooden handle"). Yet the piece suffers from conceptual redundancy: "obstacles could become instruments" reappears in multiple forms, and the storm sequence paraphrases its own beats ("approach the thickest piece of driftwood" / "her mallet moved in rapid succession" / "resonant tones carried her message"). Template cadence and elevated diction ("profound quiet between storms") stack without line-level propulsion. The phrase "sketched resonance" recurs as a motif label without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately and most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "People called him obsessed, but he knew they simply couldn't understand" restates the prior material; "a burden he was now prepared to carry" echoes "sacred duty" and "true purpose" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the expository middle (multiple "The [noun] had..." constructions). Figurative density is moderate but unmixed. Information density is acceptable but not exceptional; the chamber discovery sequence could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and comprehensible, but multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn accumulate (e.g., "noble lies" recurs across eight sentences with minimal variation; "recapture," "rescue," "preserved" cycle without added pressure). Template cadence appears in repetitive "Eleanor + verb" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("pit of lies," "soul of this historical moment") flatten peak beats. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate Eleanor's mission without advancing stakes or choice, reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is generally high. Figurative language ("silent sentinels," "hushed blaze") recurs but does not overwhelm individual beats. Minor scaffold issues: "The firm shore surveyor" opens three sentences, and "antique traveling inkwell" appears four times with identical phrasing, trending toward synonym avoidance rather than true variation. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the final third restates the "archeologist of abandoned dreams" frame twice within three sentences, slightly dulling momentum. Information density is solid; propulsion is moderate, with no major opacity touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" appears four times, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "dappled resolve" twice, "antique ink stamp" six times, often in functionally identical clauses. Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]" opens eight sentences; "The blackout [verb]" opens three. Stock metaphors ("phoenix rising from waves") and therapy-speak ("sense of self," "emotional" without embodiment) dull the closure beats. The Chinese character "通常" is a clear artifact. Cumulative line-level debt reaches −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops accumulate: "After the shadow detached" appears three times with minimal variation; "luminous torment" and "crafty" recur as labels without evolution. Template cadence evident in paragraphs 2–3 ("His motivation was...Each crane...He had discovered...This method..."). Register drift into poetic abstractions ("theatrical of the past," "vault of recorded dreams") clashes with concrete gem-polishing beats. Figurative density is high without clear pattern or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Apply −0.8 for loops/scaffold and −0.4 for register drift, total baseline −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and momentum are sustained; no major loops or scaffold. However, repetitive phrasing appears: "unfiltered awakening" (×3), "intangibly tangible" (×2), "bleak exhilaration" (×2), and "through perturbation theory" (×3) feel like template anchors rather than purposeful echoes. The phrase "the hunt had been successful, but it was only the beginning" in the penultimate paragraph is paraphrased in the final line ("He was ready for the next hunt"), creating a minor loop. Sentence openings vary, and no figurative muddle obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "sharp-eyed" appears three times, "perpetually surprised" three times, "type foundry matrix chip" four times with full title, "brilliant dimness" twice, creating synonym churn and scaffolding drag. Peak beats rely on stock metaphor ("eyes that seemed to hold entire galaxies," "liquid night") and therapy-speak ("absolute certainty," "pure recognition") that dull immediacy. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("frequency of belonging vibrated through everything—not sound, not light, but pure recognition") without propulsive syntax. Figurative density in the convergence sequence (waves passing through matter, consciousness reaching across light-years) muddles rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and clear action sequence. However, several passages loop conceptually: "weight of unspoken words" appears twice in similar phrasing, and "manufactured memories/fabricated family trees/fictional legacies" cycles through near-synonyms without adding pressure. The phrase "sieved hush" appears three times with decorative rather than functional variation. Template stems ("he had," "Martin [verb]") recur but don't quite reach the three-line penalty threshold. Information density is solid in the discovery beat but softer in the reflective middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is adequate, but paraphrase loops abound: "neutral territory" is explained three times (isolation/stalemates, geography vs. space, "meant to be"), and "untether" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs with near-identical phrasing. Template-cadence runs appear in the opening third ("She glanced...realizing," "The wind whipped...she stared," "She needed to untether"). Stock metaphors cluster without earned particularity: "storm-worn," "forgotten ghosts," "fragile trust," "heavy weight." The final paragraph's thesis summary—"Sometimes it was stories, sometimes memories, sometimes the heavy weight of things we thought we couldn't let go"—is rhetorically balanced but adds no new knowledge or image. No single artifact obscures closure, but cumulative scaffold and synonym churn ("untether," "free," "exchange," "let go") dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence ("Days like this, when...," "Now, as she...," "Perhaps, she thought...") flatten momentum. Stock metaphors proliferate without transformation: "heavy cloak of her regrets," "anchor and albatross," "houses of cards built too high." The final paragraph stacks abstract declarations ("no longer a broken navigator but a student of the sea again") that tell rather than show. Figurative density in high-pressure beats obscures rather than sharpens the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold abound: "The weight of my dirty past pressed down" immediately follows "Everything that mattered had been wiped away"; "journey" and "begin again" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: "I touched... I ran my thumb... I took..." across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors proliferate: "haunted by the ghosts," "clean slate," "shattered mirrors." Figurative density in the opening paragraph—"delicately robust baseball," "mysterious signature pulsing," "ghosts of actions," "water in my chest"—stacks without coherent vehicle. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats: "I could finally see," "I could rebuild," "I knew exactly." These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is adequate, but multiple artifact patterns appear. Paraphrase loops: "no longer just Eliora, no longer just a beast whisperer, but a bridge between worlds" recycles structure; "Not quite solid, not quite ghost" is a stock formulation. Template cadence: "Her eyes changed first... her feet grew roots... the transformation completed" uses repetitive stems without pattern-taught payoff. Filter-verb stack in peak beat: "she was no longer... she called... mist began to rise... it was the echo." Mixed metaphor: "drinking moonlight like water" (roots drink, but moonlight as water is a mismatch). Purple density in high-pressure beats ("cosmic intimacy," "perfume possibility," "cosmic moment") without earned specificity. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.4, filter stack −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.3, register drift −0.3 = baseline ~−1.7 in Q7. Since artifacts appear throughout including closure third, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful vocabulary (onyx-ink, cloudbound, choking beauty) but suffers from ornamental density—most sentences layer figurative language without variation in sentence openings or rhythm ("The cartomancer...," "She...," "Her..."). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs restate the theme of lost time and presence without advancing pressure. The phrase "choking beauty" recurs four times as a label without evolving specificity. Stock constructions ("heart pounding with... awe and dread," "tears welled in her eyes") replace embodied sensation. Template cadence and repetitive stems dull momentum, especially in the reflective middle third. Grammar and clarity are clean, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "recycled" appears in opener/subject position four times, "steadfast pacifist" thrice, and adjacent lines restate ideas ("before birth, humanity had discovered" / "a place of pure consciousness beyond physical reality"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("spectral ghost," "stitching pattern," "flower after endless winter," "singing welcome"), and mixed vehicles ("stitching" + "needle/thread" is coherent, but "ghost of Earth" + "titanium amulet humming" + "stitching fabric between dimensions" strain logic). Filter verbs ("seemed to hold its breath," "felt their own darkness transforming") cluster in the climax without voice motivation. Loops and scaffold reduce clarity and momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "transformation wasn't something to be studied but experienced" is restated across four lines with synonym churn ("texture of transformation," "become an agent of it"). Template cadence appears in stacked declarative beats ("The understanding washed over him..."; "As the celestial alignment reached its peak..."; "In the vibrant hush that followed..."). Stock phrases—"vibrant hush" (used five times), "slow dance of celestial bodies," "whispering hush"—dull immediacy. Register drift into cosmic abstraction clashes with the plain setup. Filter verbs stack in reflective passages without voice motivation. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.9)
    Patterned artifacts pervade: "vigilant lock sentinel" opens twice, "bronze quill holder" recurs six times with minimal variation, and "winking hush" / "cradle of sparks" are synonym-churned across beats without advancement. Template cadence is visible in stacked "Each…" and "The…" openers. Metaphor strings ("cradle of sparks," "embers of revolution," "fire…catch naturally") are stock revolution imagery without fresh synthesis. The final paragraph is pure scaffold—three sentences restate "revolution quietly spreading" with zero added pressure. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "the aurora's ethereal glow" / "borrowed dawn of the aurora"; "patterns were not meant to be controlled, but respected" immediately followed by thematic restatement. Template cadence runs in the stone-placement sequence ("The second stone followed, then the third… The fourth stone… then the fifth… The sixth stone"). Stock metaphors ("her weathered hands," "sinuous bodies") and filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she believed," "she watched") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs, escalated to −1.1 because they touch the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The darkroom timer beeped" recurs with minimal variation; "the censored poet," "the envelope," "the storm" repeat as scaffolding anchors across adjacent paragraphs. Metaphor density overwhelms clarity in peak beats ("rarefied air," "cartography of scars," "storm-kissed wonder" all cluster without coherent vehicle). Register drifts into abstraction ("Ministry of Cultural Integrity," "vigil in pause") that clashes with immediate scene texture. Stock poetic phrases ("verses on the walls," "suppressed words") flatten specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent beats: "dignified chaos" appears three times with near-identical framing; "turn questions into destinations" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun subject across the opening and mid-section ("The brook's gentle counterpoint," "The needles in their tin arrangement," "The dignified chaos continued"). Stock metaphors ("prismatic chaos," "intellectual battlegrounds") appear in most early sentences without payoff. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (fractured sun, prismatic chaos, water's endless question, coded angles) muddles rather than propels. Information density is low; several beats restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("molted personalities like Phoenix feathers," "dancing between mangled metal," "whispers of his past," "blooming resistance," "cerebral cathedral," "luminous fracture") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity under pressure. Paraphrase loops abound: "rebuild" appears in six distinct formulations, "blooming resistance" is repeated identically, and the coffee tin's "false bottom" is restated four times. Template cadence in reflective passages: "Each [noun]..." structures appear in lines 2, 10, 22, 24. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous fracture" reappears in the final line without reweighting). Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("convenient amnesia of the world," "truth without chains") that clashes with the vagrant's physical reality. Deductions: density −0.7, coherence muddle −0.5, loops −0.6, template runs −0.4, artifacts at closure −1.7. Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per artifact-at-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "melodies flowing like the dreams he could never quite remember" pairs a concrete vehicle with an abstract tenor. Template stems recur: "The pianist watched," "He knew," "His research had revealed," "The pianist's plan," creating a plodding rhythm. The phrase "steely longing" appears twice, the second time elaborated as "manifested as art," which reads as thesaurus-adjacent. The final two paragraphs loop thematic assertions without advancing image or action, flattening momentum. Information density is low in the closure beat; the liminal space is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates across beats. However, pervasive filter verbs ("knew she had to," "felt the collective memory," "feeling the weight"), synonym loops ("countless," "ancient" repeated without variation), and stock metaphors ("dissolving like mist at dawn," "great beast awakening") accumulate mid-range line debt. The final paragraph stacks two participial openers and a subordinate clause, then concludes with a summary statement ("how the empirical and whimsical had once again preserved what mattered most") that tells rather than images. Information density is moderate; many sentences describe mood or setting without advancing choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    Density is low; many sentences paraphrase or restate mood without advancing action (e.g., "The slow-spoken bonsai tutor traced..." then "his voice carrying the weight of cerulean regret..."). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and quote-attribution structures. Stock phrases accumulate: "weathered fingers," "otherworldly energy," "the weight of words unexpressed," "transcendent beauty." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") dull immediacy. The final third carries these artifacts into the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative language ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") recurs in most high-pressure lines without variation or payoff, adding overwriting debt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without major artifacts. Some figurative language risks overwriting but serves purpose; no loops or scaffold obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("melodies flowed like dreams") serves momentum and clarity, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery advancing story. No significant loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "pulsing with an inner light" serves purpose without muddle. Minor overwriting but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences are concise and propel momentum, such as in the closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and frequently vivid (“delicate dust from the butterfly wing,” “soil that had seemed dead just weeks before”). There is some repetition of concepts—decay, renewal, humility, small miracles—without always adding new information, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is restrained and mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors or serious muddle. The main line-level limitation is a summarizing, essayistic cadence that keeps the piece from feeling as sharply cut and propulsive as top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some effective images (the ledger as a “scorched testament,” frost patterns as language). There is occasional redundancy and a tendency to pile abstractions (“profound silence,” “drifting resonance,” “quiet spaces”) that softens impact. Figurative language generally holds but edges toward purple in places, diluting momentum. Still, nothing majorly obscures clarity or closure; the line-level craft is solid if not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some attractive images around glass, light, and heat. Still, there are many paraphrase loops and repeated sentence patterns (“The capsize survivor…”, “The tuning fork case…”, “The winterglass conservatory…”) that restate already known information without deepening it. Abstract nouns (“beauty,” “purpose,” “resilience,” “hope”) recur without being anchored to fresh, concrete action, which flattens momentum. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet compressed or varied enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise, with a good sense of rhythm and clear sequencing; nearly every sentence advances either image or story. There are some redundancies and mild cliché (“weight of all the souls,” “edge of the world,” “older than human civilization,” “impossible spaces” repeated) that flatten what could be sharper. Description leans a bit heavily on similar structures and intensifiers (“impossible,” “never meant”), but not to the point of real opacity or drag. Line-level work is strong enough for publication but needs tightening and fresher phrasing for a truly elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is clean, grammatical, and concise, with minimal redundancy and a smooth, readable rhythm throughout. The prose occasionally drifts into slightly generic formulations (“under the most challenging circumstances,” “the promise of continuity”) that blur specificity, but not enough to obstruct clarity or momentum. Information density is good—most sentences carry narrative or thematic weight without padding—and there are no major scaffold or template artifacts. The piece would benefit from a few sharper, more surprising images to lift it into a truly distinctive register.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clean and readable with few mechanical issues, and paragraphing is logical, giving the piece a smooth cadence. Some lines carry multiple functions (image, theme, and emotional state), but there is mild redundancy in phrasing and a drift toward purple, quasi-mystical language. Figurative phrases like “pilgrim of sparks” and “foggy lucidity” are appealing at first but risk feeling like repeated ornaments rather than evolving metaphors. Overall, the prose is competent and occasionally lyrical but not yet compressed or surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with some striking phrases (“fading photographs,” “retro­cognitively trapped between moments”) and solid rhythm. There is mild repetition of structures and concepts (breathing walls, quaking reverie, dissolving/dissipating images) that edges toward sameness but doesn’t seriously impede clarity. Abstractions sometimes stand in for more specific embodied detail, which slightly dulls peak beats. No major artifacts or muddled metaphors interfere with closure, but the lines could be tightened and varied for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and largely free of syntactic glitches, with clear sequencing and generally purposeful sentences. Some phrases and structures repeat (“staggering grace,” “plant resilience in dry soil,” recaps of her role as “chained liberator”) creating mild redundancy. The final “weeks that followed” section shifts into summary and explanation, slightly dulling momentum and image sharpness at closure. Figurative language is sparse and controlled, avoiding purple-prose artifacts but also rarely surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with information, and imagery (e.g., “ice breaking on a frozen lake, yet somehow musical in its devastation”) is often evocative. Some metaphors and abstractions repeat or verge on purple, and a few lines restate similar ideas about trust, echoes, and destruction without adding pressure. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and there are no serious artifacts or muddled images interfering with closure. It’s polished and publishable, if slightly over-saturated with figurative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, mostly economical, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization. A few phrases repeat conceptually (“luminous disbelief,” “press her ear against destiny’s door”) and edge toward purple, but they don’t accumulate into full-blown overwriting. Syntax, grammar, and transitions are clear, and there’s little scaffolding or redundant explanation. The main limit at this tier is that figurative language sometimes states its own grandeur rather than trusting concrete image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally graceful with some striking lines (“each droplet falling like a period at the end of winter’s long sentence”) and good rhythm. At the same time, motifs and phrases (abandoned, contemplative, thawing, inquiry) are reiterated in ways that verge on redundancy, and some metaphors are over-explained rather than allowed to resonate. The density of figurative language is high but mostly coherent; a light trim of declarative theme sentences would sharpen momentum. Line-level clarity remains strong, with no major syntactic or grammatical distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a serviceable rhythm and some strong images (the seashell’s voice “like distant waves from a home she'd never known”). However, there is noticeable abstraction, repetition, and therapy-speak (“fundamental betrayal had shaken her to the core,” “layers of fabricated identity”) that flatten texture and feel redundant. Several phrases are clichéd or generic (“heart pounding,” “whole and unbroken”), and key insights are told rather than compressed into sharper images. Line-level craft is competent but not yet at elite, publish-ready precision.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical for this lyrical mode, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“sketching not lines and boundaries, but voids and absences”). Repetition of key phrases (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) forms a deliberate pattern rather than a loop, and syntax is varied enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There is some flirtation with purple prose and conceptual stacking, but clarity survives and key images (the last star, the glowing booklet) land cleanly. Line-level craft is strong, though a bit more concrete, embodied texture could deepen impact without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, fluent, and rhythmically varied, with several strong images (light bending around notes, snowflakes suspended midair). There is decent information density: most sentences either advance action or deepen atmosphere. However, abstraction and repetition creep in, with stock formulations (“mystical moment,” “mystical significance in the mundane,” “explore consciousness itself”) that slightly blunt impact. Some lines explain what images already imply, adding a mild sense of over-telling and reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level writing is grammatically sound and occasionally graceful, with some pleasing phrases (“ambiguously clear,” “resonant hush”). There is, however, a reliance on summary and repetition (“She realized… She understood…”) and a tendency to state insights rather than embed them in image. Figurative language is light and generally coherent, but the prose seldom does more than one job at a time (theme, character, and setting often separated into discrete sentences). Overall momentum is acceptable but not especially propulsive or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is clean and rhythmic, with few syntactic stumbles and mostly purposeful sentences. The recurring images of cracks, cycles, and measurable luck give the prose a coherent texture. There is some conceptual repetition (gardens “knowing” gardeners, luck versus measurement) and an occasional tendency toward over-explicit, essay-like statements that could be pared back. Still, there’s little scaffolding or obvious loopiness, and most sentences carry more than one function without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with generally clear sequencing and a steady, readable rhythm. There is some redundancy—ideas like the nexus, holographic principles, and “mechanically warm” reappear in ways that feel slightly reiterative rather than freshly deepening. Figurative language is sparse and safe, avoiding purple prose but also missing bolder, more specific images that could sharpen key beats. Overall, the lines carry the concept efficiently but don’t yet have the compression or multi-function density of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is polished and mostly economical, with many sentences doing dual work for atmosphere and story (“keys gleaming…like pearls in the deep” both describes and reinforces the submerged aesthetic). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; only a few phrases feel overstuffed or generic (e.g., “profound beyond mortal understanding”). There is some repetition of concepts (liminality, silence, conversation through music) but not enough to stall momentum. Rhythm and clarity hold through the climax and closure, keeping the final image legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (e.g., the inverse suffering of his fever vs. outside cold). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, not muddling clarity. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the narrative moves steadily from waking to mission. A few concept-heavy lines flirt with abstraction overload, but they don’t significantly blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to read, with a steady rhythm and few outright clunkers. There is some reliance on familiar phrases and images (“oppressive darkness,” “secrets buried beneath concrete floors,” “paint the sky in shades of pink and orange”), and a tendency to paraphrase the same thematic idea in multiple formulations. Sentences often do at least two jobs (action plus mood or theme), which keeps momentum from stalling. Line-level craft is solidly publishable-midlist but lacks the compression and surprise expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally efficient despite its lushness, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“allowing the past and present to bleed together like ink on wet parchment”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically aligned; there are few, if any, muddled metaphors or outright redundancies. Minor repetitions (“drift of untold seasons,” “crumbling peace”) don’t significantly drag momentum. Overall line-level control is strong enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is smooth, clear, and mostly economical, with sensory images (sage fragrance, hush of animals, morning light) doing effective double duty for setting and mood. There is some repetition of abstract phrases (“ordinary magic,” “wonder”) and a few slightly purple constructions, but they don’t obstruct sense or momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and transitional scaffolding is minimal. Overall line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not formally dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with some striking images (e.g., silence pressing “like a remembered sound,” axis displacement as “reality thinned at the edges like worn fabric”). Information density is decent, and sentences usually do more than one job. Yet there is noticeable repetition (“bronze quiet,” “sensitively perceptive,” “metal bones”) and a tendency toward similar sentence structures and conceptual restatements, which slightly dull momentum and impact. The line-level craft is solid but could be tightened and varied to achieve higher compression and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is mechanically clean and readable, with a few strong images (the typewriter in the old lamp room, shadows on the spiral staircase). Yet there is a lot of conceptual redundancy around “open secrets,” “hidden in plain sight,” shifting perception, and the universes speaking through him, which creates paraphrase loops. Many sentences carry similar lengths and structures, producing a slightly monotonous, essayistic texture. Line-level craft is solid but not especially tight or charged under the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with some striking images (the indigo that absorbs light, silence as physical weight). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to gum up clarity, and sentence-level logic is consistently coherent. There are a few mild redundancies and slightly purple turns, yet they don’t stall momentum or blur cause and effect. Information density is reasonably high: most lines either build atmosphere or advance the ritual, with little obvious scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically controlled, with several sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and interiority. There is some tendency toward repetition and mild purple diction, especially in the accumulation of symphony/metaphor language and mirrored imagery. A few adjacent lines restate similar ideas (silence, hush, mirrored horizon) without adding much new pressure. Nonetheless, momentum holds to the end and the closure image isn’t obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatical, with competent rhythm and some evocative images (“damp golden stones humming,” “the sky a bruised purple”). Information density is decent: most sentences do at least one job, and there’s limited overt scaffolding. Repetition of key phrases (“fractured timelines,” “procedural generation,” “periodically eternal”) sometimes feels conceptual rather than texturally varied, and a few abstractions blunt immediacy. The language leans a bit expository in explaining the system, but no major loops, purple stacks, or syntactic artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a clear throughline and minimal confusion. Some metaphors (“wrapped around her heart like winter’s chill”) and abstractions are stock, and several sentences paraphrase each other conceptually, softening momentum. Telling often substitutes for scene, which limits line-level intensity and specificity. Nonetheless, the rhythm is smooth and the final images are legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally concise, with clear sequencing and strong control of basic sentence structure. However, there are noticeable repetition and scaffold artifacts—phrases like “nurture integrity in solitude,” “layered tranquility,” and “by progressing laterally” recur with minimal reweighting, and several sentences restate similar ideas about his investigations or the zone’s governance. The rhythm tends toward similar clause-heavy constructions, which can dull momentum in what should be sharper beats. Line-level work is solid but not yet refined to the density and precision expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with relatively high information density and few redundancies. Images like “crystal shadows” and “echoes in chlorophyll” are evocative and mostly coherent, and the prose maintains momentum despite a reflective mode. Some metaphor and abstraction are repeated a bit too often (light/shadow as meaning; grief/love equivalence) and a few lines lapse into stock formulations, slightly dulling impact. Still, there are no major artifacts or muddles, and the closing cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with strong control over syntax and few outright redundancies. There is some repetition in structure and concept (“by uncovering layers,” “texture of time,” “impossible choices”) and a tendency toward uniformly lush metaphor that risks mild purple-ness but doesn’t derail clarity. Many sentences do double duty (scene + theme) effectively, and the final cadence is clear. Trimming a few abstract adjectives and near-duplicate ideas would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is fluent and generally well-paced, with clear syntax and few outright redundancies; the story reads smoothly aloud. Information density is decent, with objects and setting doing thematic work as well as descriptive work. However, there’s noticeable reliance on familiar formulations (“seeds of a new beginning,” “beauty continued to grow in the spaces between what was and what would be,” “magnificence in simplicity”), which flattens originality and edges toward generic lyrical scaffolding. The line-level craft is competent but not yet sharp or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly concise, with a few nicely turned phrases (“strange alchemy of science and intuition”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of ideas and sentence structures (“This was the essence of his work…”; “It was this balance that had made him successful…”) that could be tightened. Abstract nouns and summary (“emotional wellbeing,” “emotional fulfillment”) sometimes stand where sharper concrete images could deepen impact. Line-level craft is solidly functional but lacks the compression and surprise typical of elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is largely clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some strong lines and effective images (the canopy of stars over the open library roof, the chipped cups at the seaside café). Information density is decent: sentences often carry character, theme, and setting at once. There is some tendency toward summary and abstraction in later paragraphs, as well as occasional platitudinal phrasing, which blunts impact and momentum. Still, there are few genuine artifacts or loops, and the closing image of the locket is clearly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without collapsing under their own weight, and grammar and clarity are clean. There is some redundancy and purple-leaning diction (“luminescent ache,” “glimmering obsidian arbor,” “webs of kinship”) that recur in ways that feel a bit self-conscious rather than newly illuminating. Figurative language is frequent but consistent in register and not logically muddled, so it doesn’t obscure action or closure. Tightening repetitions and trimming a few modifiers would sharpen momentum and further elevate already-solid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with clear sequencing and a good balance between action and description. There are some strong images (“crystal-like patterns,” “songs never sung, words never spoken—trapped echoes”) and lines often do double duty for worldbuilding and atmosphere. That said, certain phrases and ideas are repeated in similar language (interrupted cadence, restoring rhythm, borrowing time) without always adding new pressure, and a few sentences edge toward summary or mild purple rather than sharpened specificity. The line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, evocative, and well controlled, with good information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and character or theme. Some phrasing edges toward purple or redundant (e.g., reiterating Elara’s optimism and motivation in slightly different words), but not to the point of obscuring clarity. Metaphors and images are coherent and mostly well-chosen, though the explanation of the thematic insight is more prosaic than the surrounding imagery. Line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-honed for maximal compression and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and controlled, with a good blend of concrete detail and internal musing. There are some paraphrase loops and near-duplicate formulations (e.g., restating their role and motivation multiple times) that could be tightened for higher-density impact. Figurative language is sparing and mostly apt (“sapphire hush”), avoiding true purple patches. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at the razor-sharp concision expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with a good ratio of concrete detail to abstraction and minimal padding or repetition. Information density is decent, and key images (rain on the trellis, the anomalous leaf, doubled lindens) are clear and effective without sliding into purple prose. There are occasional slightly clunky formulations and one visible typo (“询问”), but nothing that obscures meaning or dulls the closure image. The piece could still be tightened for greater propulsion, especially in some summarizing sentences, but it’s already at a solid professional level.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level writing is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Imagery around water, pigment, and memory is cohesive and largely free of mixed metaphors or purple excess. There is some repetition of phrasing and concepts (insomnia, “thresh meaning,” the function of art) that edges toward didactic, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and no major scaffolding or artifact loops are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and easy to follow, with a good balance of sentence lengths and a strong visual-musical palette. Some lines edge toward purple or redundant (“steadily unpredictable” recurs; “bright darkness of creation” sits atop already-charged imagery), and a few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar content about unpredictability and possibility. Figurative language is mostly coherent and thematically aligned, though sometimes layered more thickly than necessary. Overall, line-level craft is solid and publishable with light tightening rather than transformative revision.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatically clean, and rhythmically controlled, with some strong images (“irregular rhythm of waves against the shore at dawn,” “pristine but painful emptiness”). Information density is decent; most sentences carry atmosphere and theme simultaneously. That said, there is noticeable repetition of favored abstractions (“fragments into meaning,” “navigated absences,” “staggered intervals”) and some thematic paraphrasing that could be tightened. The figurative language leans lyrical without tipping into full purple prose, but greater concision and more varied sentence construction in places would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally clear, with some striking images (the chime echoing differently in each ear, mist coalescing into frozen emotions). Sentences are mostly well-shaped, though the piece leans heavily on similar abstract constructions and repeated formulations (“He realized…,” “His analytically artistic mind…”) that add a slight scaffolding feel. Figurative language occasionally drifts toward the generic or over-broad (e.g., “geometric symphonies of paths and connections,” “encrypted light” without concrete behavior), but it doesn’t obscure core action. Information density is decent, yet pruning repeated thematic statements would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and syntactically varied, with a smooth rhythm and few technical errors; sentences often carry both setting and thematic weight. That said, key phrases and constructions loop (“through forgotten patterns,” “unheard symphony,” “sculpt space for reflection”), generating mild redundancy and a faintly templated feel. Some sections lean toward abstraction and summary rather than vivid, scene-level specificity, which dulls momentum. The language is solidly publishable but not yet at the ruthless precision and density expected at the most competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with few syntactic or grammatical issues and a steady forward movement through the story’s beats. There is a tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“final moments of a dying rainbow,” “hushed thunder of revelation”) and some conceptual repetition, but it doesn’t seriously obscure meaning. Sentences often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus interiority), though many are summary-heavy, which slightly flattens immediacy. Overall, the prose is competent and occasionally vivid, but it stops short of the precision and compression expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-structured, and purposeful, with few if any grammatical or syntactic slips. Information density is decent, though some phrases and concepts recur in slightly redundant ways (e.g., the power of the ink, the fairness calculus, death-as-transition), nudging toward mild over-explanation. Figurative language (e.g., “liquid thoughts,” “deathly vitality”) borders on purple at times but remains legible and thematically aligned. Momentum is maintained; nothing crucial is buried under ornament or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly concise, and carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, theme) without obvious padding. Repeated phrases (e.g., “blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests”) read as deliberate motifs rather than artifacts, though a few thematic statements could be tightened. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and there are no confusing metaphors or syntactic tangles. The main limitation is a slight sense of static momentum rather than any technical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and rich without devolving into full purple; images like “histories written in water rather than ink” are strong. There is noticeable conceptual repetition (fragility of documentation, layering, tides) that sometimes restates rather than advances, creating minor momentum drag. The density of abstract formulations in the last third slightly dulls the closure image’s sharpness. Line-level craft is above average but not yet ruthlessly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, with varied rhythm and a good balance between description and motion. There is some reliance on familiar formulations (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “beauty of multiple interpretations,” etc.) and minor conceptual repetition around the theme of uncertainty. Figurative language is usually controlled and legible, not so dense as to obscure sense. The prose is solidly publishable but would benefit from a few sharper, less generic turns of phrase at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with varied sentence structures and a strong sense of flow; there are no major grammatical issues or confusing constructions. Some sentences run long and summary-like, compressing multiple turns into exposition that slightly blunts immediacy. A few phrases verge on abstraction or repetition (“perpetual carnival,” “encoded messages”), but not to an obtrusive degree. Overall, the line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking, though not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level prose is clear and grammatically sound, with straightforward sequencing and no major confusion. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“moonlit summit,” “dawning hush,” “nightwatch’s hourglass sand grain,” restating her mission), creating mild redundancy. Sentences are often similar in length and structure, giving the piece a somewhat flat rhythm. The language serves story and atmosphere adequately without achieving high compression or striking originality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery (“internal circuits exposed like vulnerable nerves”). There is some purple or redundant phrasing (“magnetic calm,” “cool embrace,” multiple reverent descriptions of mist and calm) that doesn’t always pull its weight. A few metaphors and abstractions are generic rather than precise, but they don’t obscure meaning. The prose is solid and readable, though not yet lean or surprising enough for elite-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and generally efficient, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“silence here was never truly silent, but filled with a million microscopic sounds…”). Repetition of phrases like “worrying tranquility” and the condensation motif read as deliberate patterning rather than accidental loops. A few sentences edge toward purple or abstract (“meeting at a central point that mathematics alone could never reveal”), but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong and controlled, just shy of the compression and surprise that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are fluent, varied, and dense with meaning, and most details do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Some metaphors veer toward purple or pile up (“dusk bled,” “star-choked sky,” “rust flaked away like dried tears”), but they remain coherent and rarely obscure sense. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every sentence advances either mood or premise. A slightly leaner, more selective figurative palette would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and information-dense, and most images (e.g., bubbles “like captured stars,” luminescence as “captured starlight”) are effective. There is some purple redundancy (“crushing finality” repeated, emphasis on “final chamber/final distress signal”) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers that could be trimmed for sharper impact. Still, momentum holds, and figurative language remains legible rather than muddled. No serious loops or structural artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose has some genuinely striking lines and images, and repetition builds a deliberate incantatory rhythm. Yet key phrases and constructions recur with minimal new information (“copperlight repose,” “he sustained impossibilities,” repeated door and lattice descriptions), edging into redundancy. A number of metaphors are high-flown without adding precision, contributing to mild purple-prose drag. Overall clarity is maintained, but momentum could improve with tighter, less self-similar sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery and good sentence-level rhythm; phrases like “lovingly venomous pollen that made the air thick with dreams” do multiple jobs at once. There is some repetition (“lovingly venomous,” “resonant awakenings”) and occasional overstatement in the closing moral that slightly dulls sharpness. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or true purple excess. Tightening a few explanatory or redundant lines would elevate momentum and clarity further.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is smooth, largely grammatical, and often appealing at the sentence level, with some striking images (mist as “sleeping serpents,” thread as “orchid solace”). It does veer into mild purple and repetition, especially around the central mantra of “ruin into reverence” and restated explanations of the plate’s significance. The final third becomes list-like and expository—visitors, seasons, purposes—reducing momentum and compressing potentially rich beats into summary. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and there are no major metaphor tangles or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often evocative, with several strong images (roots in a “grotesque yet beautiful dance,” words flowing like “water…to a forgotten spring”). Sentences mostly carry multiple functions—advancing plot, character, and atmosphere together—without obvious scaffolding or loops. That said, there is a mild tendency toward purple or abstract phrasing and occasional repetition in concept (journeys, return, faith) that could be tightened for greater impact. The rhythm supports the contemplative pace but rarely surprises at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and often do double duty with image and idea. Figurative language—“golden arcade,” “bridge between two souls,” “eternal dance of invention and rediscovery”—is mostly apt and controlled, with minimal redundancy. There are mild repetitions (clipboard wood, dawn ritual texture) and some phrases that brush purple without deepening stakes. Overall, momentum and clarity are maintained, but the prose doesn’t quite reach the density and surprise of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally tight, with strong images (“windows catching the dying light like prismatic tears,” “thread by thread, possibility adjacent to possibility”) and good information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and legible, with only occasional verge into mild purple but no real muddling of sense. There’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and line-level clarity is consistently maintained. A touch more variation in image type (fewer repeated cosmic/whisper metaphors) could further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally fluent and easy to follow, with some effective images (moonlight on the inky surface, condensation forming letters). However, there is noticeable abstraction and repetition around key motifs (“fierce tenderness,” “healing,” “space between,” “unsent letters”) that occasionally feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh development. Figurative language is steady but leans slightly purple in places, with multiple sentences performing similar emotional work. Tightening and making some lines more concrete and specific would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, syntactically clean, and often striking in its imagery (the coral’s “labyrinthine grooves catching the fading light like ancient wisdom” is a strong example). There is solid information density, with most sentences doing atmospheric and thematic work simultaneously. Yet the line-level texture leans toward purple in places, with stacked metaphors and explanatory repetitions (“The Pacific conflict zones had taught him patience…” echoed conceptually more than once) that slightly slow momentum. A small trim of overtly figurative or expository lines would heighten impact and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with some effective images (colors emerging like developed film, mists preserving more than they destroy). There are mild clichés and sentiment-heavy phrases (“her heart quickened,” “fog-bound hearts”) and some summary passages that flatten potentially vivid beats (e.g., the council’s decision, the exhibition’s setup). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to obscure clarity, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Overall, the line-level craft is solid but not exceptionally sharp or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and fluent, with good rhythm and multi-function lines (sensory description often also advances concept), and minimal redundancy; the nested-awakening pattern is clearly articulated without becoming mechanically repetitive. Minor issues include occasional purple-ish metaphor density and the “soundsOrganized” typo, but they don’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is clear and mostly economical; information density is high, and there are few genuine redundancies despite the conceptual sweep. Some phrasing loops (“The converging chaos of their methods…” appearing in close variants) and stacked abstractions slightly blunt the impact at key beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, and there are no major rhythm or clarity failures. Overall the prose is solid and publishable in many venues, but not at the razor-honed level expected for the most competitive literary outlets.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with many lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “reef-shadow joy, a complex happiness that acknowledged the ocean of sorrow beneath it”). Information density is high and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; sentences generally advance mood or world in purposeful ways. At times, the figurative language stacks (“current of starlight and tears,” “photosynthesize pain into beauty”) tumbling toward purple, and key phrases recur verbatim enough to feel slightly over-designed. Nonetheless, clarity holds and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and largely efficient, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., chimes “resonated with the sound of forgotten names”). Sentence rhythm and paragraphing support the contemplative pace without stalling momentum, and there are no major loops, scaffolds, or syntactic confusions. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; only a few metaphors verge on decorative or slightly purple. Clarity remains intact through the climax and closure, which keeps the line-level work in a strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a steady cadence that is easy to follow. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts (“symphonies of truth,” “interconnected promises,” “restore trust after silence”) that sometimes feel like paraphrase loops rather than fresh developments. Some lines drift toward purple or abstract (“network of obligations,” “latticework of relationships”) without adding concrete new information. Line-level craft is solid but not yet taut or surprising enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is fluent and grammatically clean, with sensory density and smooth sentence flow; nearly every line supports atmosphere or character. That said, there is noticeable repetition (“breathing” building, “tremble/tremulous,” “dappled resolve,” “encrypted compassion”) and some paraphrasing of the same emotional state in adjacent sentences. Figurative language occasionally veers toward the purple without adding new information, and key abstractions are named rather than dramatized. Momentum holds, but tighter pruning and more varied imagery would be required for elite-line polish.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with solid rhythm and layered sentences doing multiple jobs at once. There is occasional purple stacking of metaphors (“bloomed in her senses even as it withered away the memories,” “cosmic dust of her yesterdays”) that risks blurring rather than sharpening the image, but it does not obscure meaning. Redundancy is minimal, and transitions across time are efficiently handled in a sentence or two. Tightening a few over-decorated lines would elevate the piece into a more elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly elegant and purposeful, with good rhythm and integrated imagery (grain as runes, light refracted, thresholds thinning). There is some repetition of key modifiers and concepts that drifts toward ornamental (“featherly determination,” “fractured hush,” “necessary distances”) and occasional platitudinous phrasing. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, and most sentences do at least two jobs—worldbuilding plus interiority or theme. The line-level craft supports the ending without significant muddle, but it doesn’t fully escape a mild purple sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and image-rich, with some strong phrasings (the dome filled with “living stars,” the feather’s transformation into a map). However, it leans toward purple, with repeated adjectives and motifs (“softly ingenious,” “shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”) and occasional slightly awkward constructions that feel generated rather than organically voiced. Several sentences restate similar emotional beats (wonder → belonging) without adding new pressure or specificity. Rhythm and clarity hold, but line-level tightening would notably improve momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and generally well-paced, with vivid but controlled imagery (crater glass, glowing seeds, emotion-flowers). However, there’s noticeable paraphrase and conceptual repetition around key phrases (“before memory fades,” “cheerful gloom,” definitions of disappearance vs. metamorphosis), which slightly dulls momentum. Several sentences carry explanation rather than fresh information, especially in the final third, where insight is reiterated. Despite this, line-level clarity is strong and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmically varied, and free of serious scaffolding or syntactic glitches; it reads smoothly aloud. Information density is decent, with description often doing double duty for mood and character. There is some conceptual repetition around Leo’s method and motivation, and a few lines veer toward mild abstraction or exposition where tighter, more concrete moments could carry the same weight. Overall craft is solid but not ruthlessly spare or surprising at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clean, syntactically varied, and free of major artifacts or confusion, with some strong images (“threads of luminous ink,” “obsidian grace”). There is a tendency toward abstraction and repetition of similar constructions (“a magic that…,” “a pattern that…”) that add a slight sense of redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it occasionally drifts toward purple without advancing tension or specificity. Overall momentum holds, but sharper cuts and more concrete, less reiterated phrasing would elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (dew-laden spiderwebs as crystal structures, ripples as concentric time-rings). Information density is decent: most lines carry both scene and mood. However, there is noticeable conceptual repetition and scaffolding, especially around the “seeing value in the mundane/light transforming ordinary materials” idea, which is stated in multiple near-synonymous ways. Figurative language occasionally veers toward purple or abstract (“noctilucent reckonings,” “spaces between light and shadow, clarity and mystery, seeing and truly seeing”) without adding new precision.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and sentences that do multiple jobs—advancing mood, character, and theme at once. Imagery of stars, scars, and porcelain is controlled and mostly avoids mixed metaphors; rhythm and paragraphing support the contemplative pace. There is a mild tendency toward overwriting via repeated conceptual phrases (“translate pain,” “bargained innocence,” “cosmic indifference”) and stacked abstractions in the final third, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, clarity and cadence remain solid, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“tide-polished,” “glimmering like a soap bubble,” “spinning like a dervish”) and a good ear for cadence. Many sentences do double duty—advancing action and worldbuilding together—though there is some conceptual redundancy around “trial balloons,” “equations of hope,” and “patterns” that could be tightened. Metaphorical density is high but generally coherent; a few phrases (“decorum and disruption in a dance of serene upheaval,” “fabric of possibility”) flirt with purple abstraction. Momentum softens more than it needs to in the middle, yet the final bioluminescent image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is cleanly grammatical with good clarity and a few striking phrases, and it maintains momentum without obvious scaffolding or loops. Some constructions are clunky or redundant (“sensitively perceptive,” repeated invocations of “legacy's burden,” and mild over-explanation in the final paragraphs), which slightly dulls impact. Figurative language is used sparingly and doesn’t tangle, but the line-level doesn’t quite reach a sharp, compressed elegance. Overall, it’s competent, readable craft that could be tightened to feel more precise and less expository near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and read smoothly aloud. Imagery is rich but generally coherent—rain, prisms, echoes, and mirrors create a unified palette rather than a grab bag of metaphors. There is some mild redundancy in phrases and a tendency toward adornment over compression, which slightly softens momentum in a short piece. Still, clarity is never in doubt, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and polished, with strong sensory anchors and a few memorable phrases (“trust as fragile as terracotta,” “dark witness to history’s unfurling”). There is some tendency toward abstraction and repetition of conceptual terms (peace, redemption, history, flawed beauty), which slightly blunts momentum and immediacy. Still, sentences typically do multiple jobs—advancing time, deepening theme, and sustaining atmosphere—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language stays coherent and doesn’t obstruct clarity, though a leaner edit would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with effective lines like rain striking “with a sound like tiny bells” and the egg as “cool and perfect,” which do multiple jobs at once. There are minor lapses into cliché or over-articulation (“divided soul,” “carefully constructed facade,” restating that he is amoral yet secretly tender), and some sentences summarize what’s already implied, reducing density. The rhythm holds and the closure image is clear, with no significant scaffolding or muddled metaphors. Tightening a few stock phrases and trimming explicit thematic sentences would elevate the line-level work considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythmic control and a clear sense of cadence that supports the ritual atmosphere. Recurrent phrasing and key motifs build pattern, but at times slip into redundancy (e.g., multiple close reiterations of “prism sanctuary under starlight,” “between sigh and smile,” “harvest of echoes”) and thematic restatement. Figurative language is dense yet mostly coherent; it occasionally verges on purple but rarely impedes clarity. Overall information density and momentum are sound for a lyric piece, though slight trimming could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often graceful, with some images (indigo twilight, the glowing story stick) offering genuine lyric lift. At the same time, key phrases and concepts loop in near-identical form, creating a sense of scaffolding and mild redundancy rather than deepening each time. Important actions—like the actual content and friction of the show—are told in summary, leaving potential high-intensity beats underdeveloped. The line-level work is competent and occasionally lovely, but could be tighter and more varied.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double work (world-building plus emotion or theme) and clean grammar and sequencing. However, figurative and adjectival density is consistently high (“verdant grotto,” “blushing stillness,” “cloudlight,” “living tapestry,” “divine chorus”), bordering on purple in places and occasionally dulling impact by lack of contrast. There are minor redundancies of concept (transience, patterns, remembering) that could be tightened without loss. At an elite level, trimming a handful of ornate phrases would sharpen rhythm and deepen the closing image’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and purposeful, with concrete images (braids, punched holes, frozen tears) carrying multiple layers of meaning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and coherent, and there are few, if any, true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. A couple of phrases (“snowmelt ardor”) recur in slightly slogan-like fashion, and the emotional summations occasionally tell what the imagery already shows, but these do not seriously blunt momentum. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues with only minor trims needed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, readable, and rhythmically varied, with some effective images (the directive “like memories left too long in the sun,” dust motes “like tiny spirits”). At times, language tips into abstraction or soft cliché (“dance between choice and calling,” “trinity of perception”) and leans heavily on conceptual statements over concrete dramatization in the final third. Figurative density is moderate and doesn’t obscure sense, but the closing paragraphs feel more told than shown. Line-level craft is solid, just short of the tightest, most economical literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (“amethyst and indigo,” the tile unfolding like origami, light connecting unknown constellations). Information density is decent, and most lines advance atmosphere or concept. There is mild purple-tinge and repetition, a stray Chinese phrase (“无数次”) and a probable typo (“dato”) that break immersion slightly, plus some conceptual redundancy in describing Anu’s duality. Line-level craft is competent and sometimes striking, but not yet razor-honed or fully economical.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clear, with some evocative images (“bench covered in what appeared to be starlight given solid form”) and efficient sentence-level progression. There is a tendency toward abstraction and purple diction (“metallic despair,” “fundamental shift,” “shimmering light”) that occasionally dilutes precision. Some conceptual repetition (melody of the soul, shifting reality/grace) skirts paraphrase without fully becoming looped scaffolding. Overall, craft is competent and sometimes striking but not consistently sharp or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and clear syntax; many sentences do double duty for mood and information. There is some tendency toward over-ornamentation and repeated motifs (“twilight frost,” “glass mountains,” “ruined orchard”) that begin to feel like scaffold rather than fresh insight. A few lines paraphrase the same idea (his philosophy of boundaries, the lineage of mirror makers) without adding new pressure. Still, clarity is never lost and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with strong concrete choices like the tin of repair scraps and the aching quartz eye. Some lines verge on purple or redundant metaphor (“deciduous vows flittered…”, repeated promise imagery) and a few abstractions blunt otherwise sharp images. Nonetheless, sentences usually do double duty for mood and character, and momentum is maintained without obvious scaffolding or loops. Line-level craft is strong but not yet distilled to the precision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and often striking in its imagery (e.g., petals like “captured starlight,” the weight of “collapsing stars”). It does drift toward purple and redundant at times, with conceptual phrases and even whole ideas echoed (“most profound philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms” appears twice almost verbatim). Abstract formulations (“simply complicated nature of existence,” “brightened disquiet”) occasionally dilute immediacy rather than sharpening it. Despite these, clarity remains high and most sentences carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding + mood, or characterization + theme).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied syntax and a good information-to-sentence ratio, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Occasional purple touches and recurring motifs (“unheard symphony,” explicit thematic phrasing) edge toward overstatement but don’t derail clarity. There’s little visible scaffolding or synonym churn; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interior tilt). The prose is solidly professional but not yet at the razor-sharp precision and compression expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with clear syntax and minimal redundancy; sentences usually do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is generally coherent and on-theme, though phrases like “blissfully aberrant,” “unkindled solace,” and explanatory asides about what the garden “is” edge toward abstraction and mild purple. Momentum holds despite a reflective mode, but several sentences summarize insights that could be more powerfully dramatized. There are no major artifacts or loops, yet the prose stops short of the striking precision and compression expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and largely economical, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus character or concept plus mood). Recurrent phrases (“warmly methodical,” “translate confusion into clarity”) operate more as motif than redundancy, and there’s minimal scaffolding or synonym churn. Description is precise without veering into purple, and action ordering is always clear. The language is solid and publication-ready at many venues, though to reach a top-tier standard it could benefit from a few sharper, more surprising turns of phrase or compressed images at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clear, with a pleasing rhythm and purposeful repetition of key phrases (harmonic caves, ripple marks, bloom of hush, gently luminous stone) to build pattern. Most lines carry at least two jobs—worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme—and there is little scaffolding or syntactic monotony. Some diction lapses into mild redundancy (“gently luminous” appears multiple times; several sentences begin with “The mapkeeper…” in close succession), and a few abstract statements could be tightened. Overall, the prose is solidly publishable but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory images and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Descriptive passages often pull double duty, building world and mood simultaneously. Some lines lean on generalized phrasing (“her heart filled with thistle-blown hope,” “prove that coincidences had meaning”), which feel less sharp than the best images elsewhere. Overall momentum holds, but the language could benefit from a bit more concreteness and less abstraction in peak thematic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with evocative images (“memories dripping like the rain outside,” “pattern like a signature”). There is some repetition and mild purple flourish—occasional concept restatements and stacked abstractions around memory/identity—but it rarely obscures meaning or momentum. The prose maintains forward motion appropriate to a meditative piece, and mechanical errors are absent. Strong craft, short of the incisive compression and freshness that would reach elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich, with several striking lines (e.g., “purple that sang, green that whispered”). Description often does double duty for mood and theme, and sentences mostly avoid redundancy. At times the language leans toward purple or abstract (“gravity of hopelessness,” “serious playfulness”) without adding precision, blunting impact slightly. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained, and there are no major syntactic artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with some nice turns of phrase and effective repetition of core motifs. Yet it leans into redundancy—circling “transition periods,” “texture of time,” and the cicada’s symbolism multiple times with similar language—creating a sense of thematic and syntactic looping. Several sentences are long and abstract, which slightly blurs momentum in what is already a low-pressure scene. Line-level craft is solid but could be sharpened by cutting repetition and tightening abstractions into more concrete, multi-purpose images.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and imagistically rich, with many sentences doing double duty for world-building and emotional tone (“chimed without audible sound, their vibrations felt rather than heard in the bones and the heart”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain momentum, and information density is high. However, there’s a tendency toward over-packed, multi-clausal sentences and occasional purple constructions (“intangibly tangible,” “psychological torture she barely endured”) that feel more ornamental than necessary. These do not derail clarity, but they slightly blunt impact and would benefit from selective tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level prose is smooth, grammatical, and generally concise, with a consistent cadence that suits the contemplative mood. Imagery around prisms, glass, and silence is specific without tipping into full purple-prose excess. There is some repetition of constructions and motifs (“fluidly logical,” “vaulting hush,” and explanatory sentences about his method and motivation) that feels slightly expository rather than necessary. Nonetheless, no major loops or figurative muddles impede clarity, and momentum is adequate for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with some effective images (“mechanical sunrise,” “transparent wood and solidified light”). At the same time, modifiers and metaphors pile up in places (“cascading display of fractured light that concealed the entryway,” “garden that seemed suspended between two eras”), edging toward purple and occasionally slowing momentum. There are mild redundancies in phrasing and a tendency to label feelings rather than embody them, but no major artifacts that obscure meaning. Line-level craft is solid mid-tier: readable, with flashes of vividness but not yet rigorously pared or musically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically controlled, and highly imagistic, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the story’s motif set (ash, shadow, thresholds, breath), avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. There is some repetition of abstract nouns and constructions (“emptiness,” “threshold,” “suffocation”) and a few lines that tell what the surrounding images already imply, but not enough to seriously drag momentum. No clear scaffolding, template cadence, or artifact loops interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level prose is clean, grammatically solid, and mostly concise, with some appealing phrases (“characters doubling and overlapping strangely,” “shadowseam wonder”). That said, there is notable redundancy and tell-y phrasing—multiple descriptions of her motivation and redemption arc say similar things in slightly different words, and some images (“ashes of her past,” “financial ruin”) are stock. Figurative language is moderate and generally coherent, but the emotional peaks lean on summary instead of sharp, fresh sensory detail. Momentum holds, yet tighter editing could reduce repetition and heighten impact, especially near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and often pleasing at the sentence level, with strong images like the glowing ceiling carving and shifting floorboards. However, there is repetition and purple tint—“first yawn of evening,” “golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition,” and “eloquently silent” recur without always adding new layers. Some sentences paraphrase the same idea (truth ending the dynasty, standing waves as bridge, intention as key) rather than deepening it. Line-level craft is solid, but pruning and sharpening could lift it to a more elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, weaving image and concept efficiently for this lyric mode. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (e.g., repeating “factually mystical,” multiple near-synonymous descriptions of paradoxical sensation), but it stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines do double duty for mood and world-building. Tightening a few adjective-heavy constructions would sharpen impact, yet the line-level craft is already strong enough for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly economical, with some pleasing phrases (e.g., “room of unexamined unknowns”) and a clear through-line. There are mild redundancies and minor slips (“unfurred” for “unfurled,” repeated use of “tactfully hopeful,” restated thematic ideas) that slightly blunt sharpness. Figurative language stays restrained enough not to become purple, but some lines tilt into abstract telling instead of concrete dramatization. Overall momentum holds, yet a tighter pass trimming repetition and polishing a few word choices would be necessary for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, and it carries the scene without major confusion; sentence rhythm varies reasonably. That said, there are copy-level issues (typos and concatenated words), some purple-leaning modifiers, and occasional overpacked sentences that could be sharpened. A few images feel more like stock dystopian rhetoric than precise observation. The line-level work is serviceable but not yet refined to the density and precision expected at a prestigious literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with few if any grammatical or syntactic errors and a coherent rhythmic flow. However, there is clear redundancy and phrase-looping—multiple mentions of “quietly vivid,” “vested hush,” “eerie nostalgia,” dewdrops forming, and mist—without each reprise adding new pressure or information. Figurative density is moderate but sometimes leans into decorative rather than functional imagery. The prose is solid enough for mid-tier venues, but would likely need tightening and some fresh, less-prompt-bound metaphors for a top literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, images are clear, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus atmosphere plus character). However, the prose leans toward the purple at times, with stacked modifiers and abstract intensifiers (“most important work of the year,” “rarest of all arbor-born minerals”) that don’t always add precision. There is some mild redundancy and a noticeable slip in “emerges transformed always,” which feels like an unedited loop. Even so, momentum holds and closure remains clear, keeping the piece above-average at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a reasonably varied cadence. There is some redundancy and reliance on familiar formulations (“beneath the ashes,” “both terrifying and liberating,” the closing platitude-like line) that read more like theme scaffolding than precise image. Information density is decent, with most lines carrying story or atmosphere, and there are no major loops or artifacts. Sharper, less generic phrasing at key beats (realization, ending) would markedly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is mostly clean, with strong noun-verb choices and vivid imagery (steam “like a ghostly sigh,” gold leaf melting into etched lines). Information density is good; nearly every sentence advances mood, character, or the forging action. Nonetheless, there’s a tendency toward thematic redundancy and slightly purple phrasing (“luminous regret,” “luminous purpose,” “balanced alchemist complete at last”) that could be pared back for sharper impact. Occasional near-paraphrases of the same idea (loss → regret → redemption) soften the closure image a bit.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence structures, clear syntax, and purposeful descriptive density. A few phrases and abstractions recur (“luminous ache,” “integration of laughter into healing”) and there’s some mild purple-leaning diction, but it rarely muddies clarity. Most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or looped paraphrase. The prose is strong and publishable with minor tightening rather than dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is frequently vivid (“inhaling shards of glass,” “ultraviolet penance”) and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. It also edges into purple and repetitive abstraction: key phrases and concepts (“ultraviolet penance,” “mathematics of mercy,” “enhanced”) recur in slightly rephrased form, and some sentences paraphrase prior content without adding new pressure. Figurative density is high, occasionally blurring rather than sharpening feeling, and several lines slide into conceptual summary instead of concrete dramatization. Still, grammar and sequencing are clean, and despite the overwriting tendency, clarity and momentum mostly survive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally clear, with some strong images (hidden dots “like constellations in a night sky”). At the same time, key phrases and constructions repeat (“eternal instant,” “anchors of intuition,” “between-worlds translator”), producing a slight scaffolding feel and diluting impact. Abstractions (“true purpose,” “overlooked histories,” “boundaries between realities”) often substitute for more concrete, scene-specific language, which blunts momentum. Still, the sentences flow smoothly and avoid major figurative muddles or outright purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is fluent and mostly clear, with good rhythmic variation and some strong, concrete lines (e.g., dust “leaked like steam from the cracks in the walls”). Yet there are noticeable redundancies and abstract formulations, particularly in the final paragraph, where thematic scaffolding (“transforming his weightless burden from a curse to a calling”) restates rather than deepens what the scene already implies. Figurative language occasionally edges toward purple or familiar cliché, but not so much that it muddies basic sense. Tightening and pruning would lift momentum and sharpen the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: imagery is striking, syntax varied, and most lines do more than one job (world-building plus mood plus theme). There is some tendency toward purple or abstract phrasing and a high density of metaphor, but coherence is maintained and momentum doesn’t stall. Redundancy is limited; the piece avoids obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The final lines land clearly, even if a touch of rhetorical inflation slightly dulls their sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with imagery that is mostly precise and apt (“shimmering curtains of rippling moments,” “burnished sorrow”). There’s some repetition of key abstractions (“reimagine,” “civilization,” “revolutionary”) and a touch of purple in places, but not enough to stall momentum. The prose rarely loops or scaffolds; nearly every line advances atmosphere, world, or theme. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with a smooth cadence and well-structured sentences that are easy to follow. Many lines do double duty with atmosphere and worldbuilding. That said, figurative language is nearly constant, and some images are generic or repetitive (“like dawn chasing away night,” repeated “reclaimed light”), which blunts impact and risks purple prose. Tighter selectivity in metaphor and a bit more concrete, non-ornamental language under peak pressure would elevate this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with vivid but controlled metaphor (“stars that would never reach it”). There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and transitions between beats (study → cliffs → cavern → return) are smooth. A few phrases land close to summary or familiar trope (“something ancient stirred within her,” “where explanations fail”) and slightly dilute the freshness of nearby images. Overall, though, the prose moves cleanly and supports atmosphere without purple excess or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level craft is clean but padded: many sentences restate the same ideas with slight variations, especially around “layered meanings,” “perpetually learning,” and the thematic vocabulary. There is little syntactic variety, and the rhythm can feel monotonous due to similar sentence structures and repeated epithets. Figurative language is modest and usually clear, but the prose leans heavily on abstract summary instead of concrete, multi-tasking images. Momentum suffers as a result, even in what should be peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with smooth syntax, clear sequencing, and images that often do double duty for mood and theme. There is a tendency toward dense figurative language (“leaves danced… like scattered embers,” “dust motes… like suspended stars,” etc.), which occasionally edges toward purple but rarely disrupts clarity. A few phrases and concepts repeat (“dawning hush,” the long pursuit across seasons) in ways that could be tightened without loss. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable with light trimming for economy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level writing is clean and grammatical, with a smooth rhythm and no major clarity issues. There is noticeable syntactic and conceptual repetition (many sentences structured similarly and a tendency to rephrase the same idea of “truth vs. official history” in adjacent lines). Figurative language occasionally veers purple and abstract, diluting impact instead of intensifying it. Overall, the prose is competent and at times evocative, but it lacks the compression and precision expected at the most competitive level.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some effective images (swirling shadows in a seamless bottle, lanterns glowing into dawn). Yet there is notable conceptual redundancy—multiple sentences reiterate that infrastructure improved but spirit did not, or that wishes are “false comfort” versus true transformation. Several lines read like scaffolding or summary rather than compressed, multi-tasking sentences, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is competent but conservative and occasionally generic, more functional than sharp or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely tight and musical, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing action while layering atmosphere and theme), and minimal redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (“velvet disquiet,” “whisper of history etched in stone”) is generally controlled and legible, and the syntax varies enough to keep momentum in a reflective piece. There are a few slightly purple or concept-heavy constructions that could be pared for even greater sharpness, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is solidly publishable and often graceful.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and dense, often doing double duty by advancing both atmosphere and theme (“frost dancing on the glass containers like captured fireflies in a universe of contained possibilities”). Sentence-level rhythm generally propels rather than stalls, even with long constructions, and there are few if any outright redundancies. That said, figurative language is nearly constant, and some phrases “explain” the metaphysics (“By decreasing the entropy…reversing the natural flow of time”) in a register slightly flatter than the surrounding imagery. The overall effect remains strong and controlled, just shy of the most incisive, cut-to-the-bone line work expected at the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, economical, and musical, with vivid phrases that usually pull double duty for mood and character. Information about Elias’s methods and history is well-compressed rather than repetitive, and syntax varies enough to avoid monotony. The main weakness is occasional abstraction and paraphrase—especially in the thematic sentences—which momentarily flatten momentum and specificity. There are no significant artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles that touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is mostly clear, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information. There is some repetition of concepts (“cosmic tapestry,” “interconnection,” “vulnerability as strength”) and a tendency toward abstraction and stacked modifiers, but it rarely obscures meaning. Figurative language is frequent but not egregiously mixed, and there are few if any true scaffolding or synonym loops. A lighter touch on the most generic cosmic-spiritual phrases would sharpen impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and economical, with several striking images (“Sunlight fractured through the cracked glass domes of empty hives, casting prismatic shadows…”). Sentences often do double duty, advancing world, mood, and theme at once, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There are some abstraction-heavy lines and small repetition (“Through contextual clues…”) that could be tightened, and a few theme-summarizing sentences could be rendered more in scene. Nonetheless, there are no major artifacts or muddled metaphors, and the line-level craft is solidly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, readable, and occasionally striking (“leaking moments like water through a sieve”). There is some repetition of ideas and sentence shapes (“The more she learned, the more she felt…”) and a tendency to explain realizations rather than compress them into sharper images. Figurative language is generally controlled, though a few lines verge on thematic summary instead of doing multifold work. Momentum holds for the length, but trimming redundant phrases and abstract restatements would increase density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images and rhythmic sentences that read smoothly aloud. There is some density of metaphor and repetition of thematic phrasing (e.g., multiple articulations of incomplete beauty and harmonizing discord) that edges toward purple and could be trimmed for impact. Most sentences do more than one job, but a few restate similar insights in slightly different language, slowing momentum. Clarity is never lost, yet a tighter, less expository final third would elevate the prose to a more publishable sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-structured, and carry multiple functions (advancing time, mood, and world simultaneously), with minimal obvious scaffolding or loops. There is some mild purple-leaning abstraction and repetition of phrases like “architectural secrets,” “bridge between worlds,” and “interspecies respect” that could be sharpened or grounded in fresher, more concrete language. The prose flows smoothly and supports the lyric tone, if a bit uniformly solemn. Line-level craft is strong but not razor-edged enough yet for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some strong images (the amber as “golden stillness,” spring rain cleansing as understanding arrives). Yet there is noticeable redundancy (reiterated “rainwashed,” “bronze quiet,” “artificial pilgrimage,” and similar insights restated in adjacent lines) and a tendency toward purple, abstraction-heavy phrasing. Figurative language and thematic labels crowd the page without always adding new information, softening momentum. Tightening loops and pruning some modifiers would substantially elevate the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are mostly clear and grammatical, with a pleasing rhythmic variety and some strong images (“underwater silence now a constant reminder”). The prose occasionally verges on purple or repetitive in its abstractions (“fragile embrace,” “wounded world”) and explains where an image might suffice. There is a visible glitch/typo (“ttk duelersi"  "The blackberries will grow first,") and some slightly clotted phrasing around theme articulation. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at a polish where every sentence pulls maximum weight without minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and largely free of clutter or loops; sentences often carry both world-building and emotional charge. Recurrent phrases (“wild hush,” “tinted revelations”) function as motifs rather than dead repetition. There is some tendency to explain realizations in abstract terms and to stack slightly elevated phrases (e.g., “translate distance into closeness”) that could be grounded more in immediate sensation. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no major artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with mostly clear sentences and consistent rhythm. Yet there is substantial conceptual and lexical repetition—shutdown, pariah, gift/curse, legacy, true north—without added nuance, creating a sense of looped emphasis rather than progression. Figurative language is safe and sometimes clichéd, and several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas (e.g., her role as keeper/guardian/cartographer of hope) with minimal new information. The overall effect is gently overwrought but not incoherent, keeping the piece readable while limiting its sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are grammatical, clear, and mostly well-paced, with a reasonable mix of longer descriptive lines and shorter actions. There is some repetition of favored phrases/concepts (“apprentice of wonder,” “sacredly playful,” “chivalrous thief”), but not to the point of real drag. Figurative language is straightforward and rarely overwrought, and each sentence generally carries its narrative weight without obvious scaffolding or loops. The main limitation is a tendency toward telling labels rather than concrete embodiment at key emotional beats, which slightly flattens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Recurring phrases like “luminous absence” and “nomadic penumbra” create texture rather than pure ornament. Still, there is noticeable redundancy in explaining Elara’s mission and the importance of small gestures, and a mild tendency toward abstraction and purple diction. The bracketed Chinese “needs correction” notes are clear artifacts that would need removal in a publishable draft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with a pleasing mix of sentence lengths and a good sense of cadence. Several images are strong and concrete (the humming stone, inner light on the raven feather), and most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building plus interiority). There is some repetition of abstract diction (“endless,” “vast,” “possibility”) and a tendency toward mildly purple generalization in key beats, which reduces edge and momentum. No major artifacts or loops obscure meaning, but tighter pruning of abstractions would sharpen the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and easy to follow, with few grammatical or syntactic issues and a clear causal flow between sentences. Many lines do double duty—advancing both worldbuilding and emotion—and the rhythm is mostly well-paced for a reflective piece. However, there is noticeable repetition in conceptual language (redemption, forgiveness, hush, humility) and occasional purple-leaning adjectives, which create a mild sense of sameness and overstatement. Sharper, more concrete images in place of some abstractions would heighten impact and compression.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and rhythmically pleasing, with few syntactic or grammatical slips. Imagery is consistent and not excessively mixed, and repeated motifs (refract, echo, bone) do useful work. There is some conceptual and phrasing repetition that doesn’t always add pressure, contributing to a mild sense of thematic redundancy. Nonetheless, line-level clarity remains high and the final sentences land with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty in evoking setting and inner state, and the rhythm generally carrying momentum. Some metaphors and abstractions are striking, but a few verge on purple or redundant (“foggy veil obscuring the boundary,” “patching the frayed tapestry of his existence”), slightly diluting impact through over-layering. There are minor paraphrase/idea loops around uncertainty, meaning, and memory stitching, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or closure. Tightening a few overstuffed lines would elevate an already solid prose performance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is clean and efficient: sentences are clear, descriptive without bloat, and generally multi-tasking (character, setting, and theme at once). Figurative language is sparing and grounded, avoiding purple flourishes or confusing metaphors. There is minimal redundancy; the narrative moves consistently forward, especially given the reflective mode. It’s strong, professional prose, though not yet at the razor-edged density and rhythmic distinctiveness that would merit a higher elite score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and free of obvious scaffolding or loops; most lines carry both image and emotional weight. The prose’s lyricism (e.g., “like a filter for the soul's whispers,” “gentle warmth spreading through him like a quiet sunrise”) is pleasant and usually clear. There is some mild repetition of key phrases and a slight risk of purple, but it stays on the readable side of ornate. Rhythm and clarity hold through the ending, supporting rather than obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with a good ratio of information to sentence count and a clear visual rhythm. There are a few redundancies and syntactic slips that blunt impact, especially when the prose over-explains already established motifs (the censer’s fluctuation, the calls continuing). Some phrases lean toward summary or label rather than fresh embodiment. The closing paragraphs still land with clarity and resonance despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and information-dense, and many images pull double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Phrases like “fractal patterns that resembled frozen lightning” and “both broken and beautiful” are vivid without tipping into incoherence. There is some mild redundancy (reiterating the textbooks’ discredited status and function) and a touch of conceptual telling near the end, but no major loops or purple stacking that blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong overall: sentences are clear, mostly concise, and do multiple jobs (atmosphere plus characterization plus forward motion). Some metaphors verge on purple (“dreamscape of opalescence and shadow,” “like dust on forgotten shelfs”) and there’s a minor typo (“shelfs”), but these don’t materially obscure sense or dull the ending. Exposition about the borrowed memories is efficient and not over-explained. A bit more restraint in figurative language, especially around the midsection, would sharpen momentum and elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; sentences pull their weight and transitions are economical. Some metaphors and formulations are familiar (“parchment ghosts,” “treasure or glory,” “blooming cavern… like stars”), giving the line-level a slightly generic literary sheen rather than something sharper or more specific. The climax is partially summarized in abstract terms, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, mostly well-paced, and free of grammatical issues, with a good balance of sentence lengths and a coherent rhythm. Imagery is often striking, but figurative language clusters in places (“lacy menace,” “delicate predators,” “bleeding starlight”) without always deepening meaning, flirting with ornamentation. There are a few clichéd or redundant constructions (“weight had been lifted from the queen’s shoulders”; “softly commanding presence” repeated) that could be tightened. Still, line-level clarity and momentum remain strong, and most sentences carry story or atmosphere efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a strong line-level aesthetic—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned; metaphors of light, heat, density, and spirals interlock rather than clash. There is some conceptual redundancy (“scientifically romantic” and “density of presence” are reiterated in similar registers), but it does not significantly drag momentum. The closing paragraphs maintain clarity and cadence without obvious loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with dense yet mostly purposeful imagery (“snow sometimes fell upside down,” “feral nostalgia,” “symbols older than mountains”). Sentences often do double duty—advancing atmosphere and character interiority together—keeping momentum intact for a lyric piece. There is some over-layering of abstractions (“every grave was also a cradle,” “terrifying beauty of their own mortality”) that risks sentimentality or pseudo-profundity, but clarity remains intact. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts drag the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and mostly economical, with several strong, concrete images (morning fog, dripping clocks, worn metal) doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition aside from a few slightly redundant closing lines about the clocks’ steady drip. Figurative language stays grounded and legible; nothing strains or confuses. The main limitation is a slight tendency toward abstract summary in emotional beats where a more specific embodied detail would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and efficient, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery like “vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons” or scars becoming “stories of caution and resilience” is strong and legible. There is a mild tendency toward lushness and repetition of certain formulations (“saturated hush,” variations on breath-holding) that occasionally feels like ornament rather than pressure. Still, clarity and momentum are not meaningfully harmed, and there are no visible loops or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong images like “melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins” and “a memory with weight” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. While metaphor density is high, it remains coherent and legible; there’s little true purple sprawl or redundancy, and sentences generally carry more than one layer of work. Pacing is well-managed for a quiet scene, with no obvious scaffold or paraphrase loops. A few lines (“jasmine and regret,” “time tiptoes on broken glass”) edge toward self-conscious flourish but don’t materially dull momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally clear despite its conceptual density. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and idea, and there are few true redundancies. However, the line-level texture leans toward purple and repetitive (heavy reuse of similar abstractions and constructions), which slightly dulls momentum and makes individual beats blur together. Figurative language stays internally coherent but could be pruned for sharper impact and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, concrete nouns, and a steady rhythm that suits the reflective mode. There is some redundancy (re-explaining his motivation and the peculiarity of the station) and abstraction that could be tightened without loss. The prose occasionally lapses into slightly purple or expository turns when expressing theme, and the final cut-off word is a significant polish issue that would be unacceptable at a top venue. Information density is decent, but the piece could gain energy from sharper compression and a bit more variation in sentence music.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often evocative (“burning without smoke, consuming everything yet making no sound”). Sentences tend to carry both atmosphere and information without obvious padding, and rhythm is reasonably varied. At times the language veers into abstraction and repetition (“quiet wildfire,” “revolutionizing her perception”) that flattens impact and feels slightly purple. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved throughout, with no major loops or muddled imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and often carry multiple functions (setting, character, and theme at once). There is some tendency toward purple or self-conscious phrasing and repeated conceptual labels (“lucid contradictions,” “clover melancholy”), which can feel a bit overdesigned. Still, there are few if any true loops or scaffolding sentences, and momentum for a reflective piece is maintained. With slightly leaner, less declarative phrasing at key thematic moments, this could rise into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with some memorable lines and effective parallelism. There is mild redundancy in the final third, where key ideas (estrangement as sanctuary, wrong number friendships as transformation) are restated in similar language. A few phrases veer toward purple or slogan-like (“conductor of change,” “testament to the power of reaching out”) and slightly blunt the otherwise strong texture. Still, momentum is maintained and sentences usually do more than one job.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and free of obvious artifacts or syntactic glitches; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and interiority. Recurrent motifs (flowers, context, small moments) give texture, though some phrasing becomes mildly repetitive and a bit purple in patches. Information density is good, but a few lines reiterate established ideas without adding pressure or new nuance. The final paragraphs land clearly and musically, with no figurative muddle to obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with very little syntactic clutter or obvious scaffolding. Repetition of certain phrases (“desperately jocular,” “polite anarchy”) feels intentional as motif rather than artifact. The piece relies heavily on summary, but at this length the compression mostly serves momentum. A bit more variation in sentence rhythm and a few sharper concrete images under peak beats could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with some striking images (musical notes as tactile braille, constellations pausing). Yet key phrases and concepts are repeated with minimal variation (“quiet blaze,” “stillpoint,” “ultrasonic,” “essence of emotion”), creating a faint sense of lexical loop and pseudo-profundity. Several sentences summarize emotional insight rather than letting concrete actions carry weight, edging toward purple in the closing paragraphs. Overall momentum holds, but tighter, more specific lines would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and free of grammatical issues, and the narrative flows smoothly. Some lines are evocative, but there is occasional redundancy (“thresh meaning from experience” appears more than once) and a reliance on familiar cosmic imagery (“stars seemed to wink in approval”) that undercuts sharpness. The prose often tells emotional states in generic terms rather than sharpening them through concrete action or sensory detail. It’s solid but rarely surprising or compressed to a high-literary edge.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and often carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and theme at once). The prose does drift toward purple and redundant structures at times, with similar metaphors and constructions repeated (“like scattered diamonds,” “like invisible threads,” multiple “mapped the silence” lines) without new pressure. Rhythm is pleasant but somewhat monotone, lacking sharper syntactic modulation at key moments. These issues mildly dull momentum but do not obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and readable, with some striking phrases and a clear rhythmic control. There is some repetition and scaffolding—“The volcanic tenderness of that moment overwhelmed her, the intensity of her emotions softening into resolve” followed soon by “The volcanic tenderness of those encounters never faded”—that dilutes impact. Summary passages (“For weeks…”, “Years passed…”) compress a lot of emotional and narrative movement into abstract language, reducing line-level vividness. Still, clarity remains high and there is no serious figurative muddle or syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level writing is generally elegant and high-control, with vivid metaphors and good information density—most sentences advance both world and emotion. A few phrases repeat or edge toward purple/sentimental (“quiet rebellion” reappears; “auroral sorrow,” “defiance and love,” and several Universe-breathing images stack abstractions). Still, clarity is never lost, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. The closure paragraph leans slightly heavy on thematic statement over fresh image, which blunts what could be an even sharper final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with minimal redundancy and good integration of description into action. Phrases like “navigation papers revealed patterns others missed” carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without feeling strained. There is a mild tendency toward similar sentence constructions and repeated descriptive weight (coin, key, maps each get a similar, almost reverent treatment), which slightly flattens momentum. Nothing is confusing or overwrought, but line-level daring and compression could be sharpened for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose has many strong, sensuous lines and a cohesive metaphorical palette around water, light, and shutters. Nonetheless, there is noticeable conceptual and phrasal repetition (especially around duty, teaching darkness, half-spoken secrets) that doesn’t always add new information or pressure. Some abstractions (“silent empathy in its purest form,” “stories older than time itself”) read as generic lyric shorthand rather than earning their weight through specifics. Overall momentum remains readable, but tighter line-level pruning would sharpen impact and reduce the sense of looping.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are grammatically clean, readable, and often nicely rhythmic, with some strong images (“forests of second thoughts,” “cracks in the concrete of routine”). Information density is decent, and the narrative flows without major snags or confusion. There is mild redundancy in phrasing and some tendency toward abstract, slogan-like formulations in the final third, but not enough to seriously impede momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not yet sharp or surprising enough for top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose often achieves a high line-level polish, with several striking images and efficient transitions; it reads smoothly and remains clear through the closure beat. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“her heart a battlefield of hope and fear, the combative tendleness [sic] of yearning”), and a few metaphors feel slightly strained or over-dense. A light paraphrase feel appears in places (multiple sentences reiterating dissolution and rebirth) but doesn’t seriously stall momentum. Overall, the craft is strong but shy of elite precision and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and images that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). Repetition patterns (“This whittling, this simple act…”) mostly read as deliberate rhetoric rather than scaffolding. There is some density of abstract phrasing and near-platitudes in the final third, but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or cadence. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum and mood without obvious loops or technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and rhythmically competent, and many images (“lantern-moth hush,” “mirror of the sky”) are pleasing. However, there is notable redundancy and paraphrase-looping—repeated formulations about boundaries, bans, and freedom—without added pressure or nuance, and some metaphors feel stock or overextended (“flame of defiance,” “tapestry of interconnected moments”). Figurative density is fairly high without always earning it, pushing the piece toward mild purple prose. Overall clarity holds, but information density and momentum could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: rich but controlled sentences, clean syntax, and a good ratio of image to exposition. There is some tendency toward repetition of concepts (“bartered awakenings,” “transformed reality,” “innocently cunning”) and a slightly purple, abstract tilt in places, but clarity is maintained. Most sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—and the rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. The main ceiling is that the prose occasionally explains what the images already imply, which slightly blunts momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically pleasing, and free of syntactic confusion, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases (“texture of connection,” “artificial pilgrimage,” “powerfully gentle”) and conceptually overlapping sentences that could be cut for greater density. Imagery sometimes edges into purple without adding new pressure or information. Momentum thus softens in the middle-to-late sections, even though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished and readable, with clear sentences and no major syntactic or logical errors. Yet it leans heavily on similar sentence openings and scaffolding phrases (“She would…,” “Though…,” “But in this place…”) and often summarizes states instead of embedding them in sensory or dramatic specifics. Figurative language is restrained but occasionally clichéd (e.g., “hit rock bottom,” “hollow and adrift”) and the line-level momentum stays fairly even, without acceleration at key emotional beats. Overall it’s competent but not yet sharp or compressed enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with controlled syntax and some strong images (e.g., raindrops as miniature worlds). There is modest redundancy in phrasing and a tendency toward abstract or conceptual language that can slightly dull immediacy (“underlying structures of human consciousness,” “cultural algorithms”). Figurative language and modifiers are on the verge of being over-abundant but stay mostly coherent and do not obscure meaning. Sentences pull their weight for mood and information, though sharper concision in explanatory passages would increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally graceful and efficient, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Some metaphors and abstractions (“atoms of nostalgia,” “perfect convergence of anguish and joy”) lean toward purple or conceptual, but they remain legible and tonally coherent. There is light repetition of key phrases and emotional labels without significant drag on momentum. Line-level craft is strong but not razor-honed enough to feel utterly indispensable at every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Information is generally dense and forward-moving, with few true scaffolding lines. That said, some repetitions and slightly over-insistent phrases (“preserve the shape of hope,” repeated full-phrase invocations of the library) flirt with purple or redundant emphasis. Line-level craft is strong but not razor-honed enough—especially in the thematically summative closing stretch—to qualify as flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically varied, with several effective images (the chameleon’s scales in lantern light, mist lifting at dawn). Some lines do double duty for atmosphere and character, maintaining reasonable information density. There is moderate redundancy and conceptual overlap—especially around “reconstruction,” “shedding layers,” and “fragile convictions”—and a tendency toward slightly purple or abstract phrasing in places. These issues soften momentum and freshness but do not significantly obscure meaning or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, with mostly strong nouns and verbs and a good balance between concrete detail (stone, frost, coffee rings) and interior reflection. Information density is decent; most sentences carry either world, character, or thematic weight. That said, there is some redundancy and platitude-like phrasing (multiple near-identical “healing wasn't about…” and “the coffee rings had shown her the method” statements) that could be compressed for greater impact. A slight reduction in abstract restatement and a sharper focus on image at the climax would elevate line-level force.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and often beautiful, with strong metaphorical linking of film processes to emotional development. Yet it leans heavily on similar figurative moves and repeated constructs, creating a slight sense of redundancy and purple saturation. Many sentences do similar conceptual work (“spaces between,” “liminal,” “unused love”) without adding new pressure or image. Rhythm and grammar remain clean, but tighter pruning and more varied concreteness would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some elegant images and a decent sense of rhythm. At the same time, it edges into purple and repetitive territory—phrases and concepts recur with slight synonym churn (e.g., “remembered stardust in her veins” and variations, multiple restatements of trapped/flowing creativity). Many sentences carry similar syntactic weight and metaphor density, which can dull momentum in a relatively static scene. Clarity is never lost, but tighter line edits and strategic pruning would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for world-building and emotion. Recurring phrases and images act as motifs rather than mere repetition, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Some figurative language edges toward purple, but it remains controlled and coherent with the aesthetic. Momentum is gently steady rather than propulsive, fitting the accumulative, lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, syntactically varied, and free of major errors, with some effective images and a steady rhythm. However, it leans on repeated formulations and abstract nouns (“consciousness,” “understanding,” “insight,” “transformation”) that can blur immediacy. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea—Kaelen realizing the forest is his mind and accepting miracles—without adding pressure or new texture. The overall effect is polished but slightly over-explanatory and occasionally redundant rather than maximally precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are mostly precise, and repetition (shoreline lullaby, star-stamp) is patterned rather than accidental. There is some tendency toward saturated metaphor and familiar constructions (“patient as stone”), but it doesn’t tip into muddle or redundancy. Momentum is modest yet steady, appropriate for a lyric meditation, though a sharper paring of certain descriptive clusters could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong: clean syntax, varied sentence rhythms, and images like “frostbitten hope” and “seraphically mundane” that feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Most sentences carry more than one job (world-building + emotion), and momentum is preserved despite the lyric density. There are occasional mild redundancies and abstract formulations (“safety came at a price,” “cost no one spoke of”) that could be sharpened into more concrete language. Figurative language is frequent but controlled enough that it doesn’t muddle clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly lean enough, with a good balance of image and forward movement, and no major syntactic or clarity issues. However, certain phrases and constructions recur (“pause of shifting constellations,” “regally unpretentious,” variations on “graceful collapse”), creating a faint sense of lexical looping. A few moments veer toward purple or abstract (“its purpose fulfilled,” “knowledge released back into the cosmos”) rather than concrete dramatization. Despite that, line-level craft supports rather than obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense without major redundancy. Metaphors are apt and coherent, and there are no noticeable scaffolding loops or filler sentences that stall momentum. Repetitions around “tapping,” “periodically eternal,” and “delayed revelation” mostly function as motif rather than artifact, though a few formulations verge on explanatory restatement. The final image is clean and legible, with the prose sustaining its lyrical tone to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some strong images and a consistent rhythm. However, there is noticeable redundancy and abstraction—many sentences reiterate similar emotional states (“most alive,” “connected,” “anything seemed possible,” “moment of transformation”) without adding new texture. Adjectival and adverbial stacking plus repeated clause structures slow momentum and edge toward purple, especially in the closing third, blunting the impact of the climactic image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise, with good information density—most sentences advance either worldbuilding, character, or plot. A few phrases drift toward abstraction or generic profundity (“ancient energy,” “pulsing with potential life,” “map of consciousness itself”), and there’s some mild repetition of structure, but these do not seriously impede momentum or clarity. Scene summaries (“for three days…”) compress struggle that might be more vivid in action, yet the line-level remains smooth rather than cluttered. The final paragraph lands clearly, if a bit thematically explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and economical, with strong images like the iridescent oyster shell and the rotating lighthouse gone dark. There are a few mildly purple or redundant phrases and some thematic restatement near the end, but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Sentences often do double duty (world-building and emotional shading at once), and there are no major clarity issues or template cadences. Line-level craft is solidly publishable though not yet extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is polished and generally clear, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance of image and interiority. Some repetition of concepts (“fragmented reality,” “luminescent ache”) and stacked metaphors approaches purple but does not quite tip into muddle. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about brokenness and realignment, which modestly dulls momentum. Still, most sentences do more than one job, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with strong control over rhythm and clear sequencing of events. The disappearing ink and dissolving body are described concretely enough to be visual and comprehensible. There is some mild repetition and a tendency toward explanatory phrasing (“This was their method—not invisibility, but temporal displacement…”) that slightly undercuts mystery. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved; there are no major loops or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some strong images (“data frozen in amber-light,” “the silence so profound her thoughts seemed to echo”). Most sentences carry at least two jobs (advancing plot and mood), and momentum rarely stalls. That said, there is noticeable repetition of motifs and phrasing (“echoing library under snow,” “within the blink that follows surprise,” reiterations of motivation and stakes) that could be tightened. A few sentences lean into abstract or redundant restatement, slightly dulling impact rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and largely free of syntactic errors or confusing constructions, with good rhythmic variation. Many lines do double duty, advancing worldbuilding and theme together (e.g., the dome’s condensation mirroring thought and breath). There is some redundancy and abstraction—repeated structures like “Rhiannon had…” and explicit thematic restatements—that slightly blunt momentum. Still, figurative language is mostly controlled, and there are no major loops or muddled metaphors undermining the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often striking, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. At times the density of figurative language and abstract phrasing edges toward purple, especially when several consecutive sentences carry similar weight and rhythm. There are minor redundancies in concept (“patterns broke themselves,” “moment of chaos,” “beautiful dissolution”) that could be tightened without loss. Nonetheless, there are no serious loops or muddles, and the closing images are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with some nice turns of phrase and a coherent rhythmic flow. It does drift toward repetition (“orbits of regret,” “echoing observatory”) and occasional purple-ish abstractions, and key beats are paraphrased rather than rendered in scene. Some lines double up on the same idea (legacy/regret/truth) without adding new pressure. Overall solid line work, short of the density and precision expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, purposeful, and multi-functional, advancing character, world, and mood at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and well-controlled (“meteor hush,” “time warped, folding like origami”); there are few if any mixed metaphors or outright purple passages. There’s minimal redundancy and no glaring scaffold or synonym loops disrupting momentum. The density of poetic phrasing across the whole piece edges close to overload, but clarity and the closure image hold firm.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and figurative language is mostly fresh and coherent with the world. Some phrases verge on purple or redundant (“a beautiful but unsettling sensation, like twilight on the verge of something momentous”; multiple near-synonymous restatements of the theme), which slightly blurs edge and momentum. There’s minor conceptual repetition around “meaning in the mess,” “unlearning,” and “hush” that could be trimmed for greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity never falters and the final images read cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose frequently achieves evocative, image-rich lines (“the shattered sky above…a cathedral ceiling open to stars”) and generally maintains clarity of action. However, there is a tendency toward purple density and abstraction—stacked modifiers and concepts like “warm coldness” and “aberrant mercy” being named outright—rather than letting images carry the weight. A few minor glitches (“each触发 a new memory”) and mild repetition of ideas (ruins vs. potential, warmth vs. cold) create small snags. Overall, the line-level craft is competent and often beautiful, but would need tightening and de-cluttering for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, evocative, and easy to follow, with high information density—most lines are doing character, atmosphere, and world work simultaneously. Lyrical metaphors are consistent with the established synesthetic frame and rarely feel strained. There is some repetition and mild purple drift in lists (“love and loss, of seasons changing and returning”) and in reiterated nostalgia, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or stall momentum. Line by line, the piece would need only modest tightening rather than overhaul for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are generally clear and correctly structured, with some striking phrases and an effective recurring image in the geode’s light patterns. However, there is noticeable repetition of key terms and constructions (“fractally precise,” “with willowglass hope,” “after the static shock…,” “her motivation to illuminate hidden pathways”), which creates a mild looped feel. Figurative language sometimes runs toward the abstract or pseudo-technical without adding new information, softening momentum. Overall the prose is competent and sometimes vivid, but not yet razor-edited for density and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with minimal redundancy and a steady rhythm; each sentence generally advances either worldbuilding or action. Some lines tilt toward telling or summary (“a truly factually mystical phenomenon,” “a key to understanding what occurred”) where a more image-driven approach could sharpen impact. There’s little syntactic variety or modulation of pace at peak moments—the contact with the fossil, the vision—so climactic beats feel similar in texture to setup. Still, there are no major artifacts or muddles, just a conservative, slightly prosaic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with straightforward syntax that keeps the narrative intelligible. There is some redundancy and slogan-like phrasing, especially around the prophecy and shared wisdom, which slightly dulls momentum. Many sentences do similar work in succession, summarizing emotional or thematic states rather than layering concrete action or image. Still, there is no major figurative muddle or structural artifact that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level writing is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences that do triple duty (setting, mood, and character). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and tailored, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is some mild purple (“storm within him raged as violently as the winds…”) and thematic restatement that could be trimmed for even greater density. No major artifacts or confusions impede momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing atmospheric and conceptual work at once. Recurrent phrases and ornate diction flirt with purple prose but rarely tip into confusion, and there are no major scaffold loops or obvious redundancies. Metaphors (e.g., “palimpsest promise,” “spindrift serenity”) are consistent and thematically apt. The prose could benefit from a few sharper, plainer beats around moments of insight to vary texture and emphasize turns.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, and most lines do at least two jobs (advancing image and theme together). Some phrasing trends toward abstraction and redundancy, especially in the closing moral statements, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is controlled enough to avoid muddle, but there is mild overuse of similar constructions (“as if…”) and concepts (resistance, kindness, memory) without fresh turns. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with light tightening, but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, with images like “liquid mercury” water and the “teeth-like tool” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Sentence rhythm varies well, maintaining a calm flow that fits the reflective mode while avoiding monotony. There is a mild tendency toward repeated phrases (“crystallized,” re-use of “wistfully pragmatic,” echoing “protected vulnerability”) and a slight brush with purple description in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major scaffolding, redundancy, or figurative muddle interferes with the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically pleasant, and mostly free of scaffolding or obvious loops, with images like “shelves expanding and contracting like breathing lungs” doing multiple jobs at once. There is some conceptual repetition around isolation, awakenings, and coexistence, and a few abstractions slightly blunt immediacy, but they don’t derail momentum. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and not overdone for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and flow smoothly, with a consistent, measured rhythm suited to the meditative mode. Nonetheless, there is noticeable paraphrase and motif looping—many sentences restate that she writes anonymous love letters, is a keeper of secrets, is “inevitably whimsical,” and that the world/temple is in “prismatic quiet” after the rains. Figurative language is competent but occasionally leans toward purple or explanatory (“a place she believed might hold answers,” “public art installation had been designed to show”), reducing density and edge. Tightening repetition and trusting images over explanation would significantly sharpen the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and mostly economical, with clear sequencing and minimal syntactic clutter; technical terms are used accessibly. Some phrases lean on familiar shorthand (“sleep had become a luxury,” “hairs… stand at attention”), and there is light redundancy in summarizing Elara’s obsession and the community’s division. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and it rarely obscures sense or cause/effect. Overall, the line-level work supports the story without drawing much attention to itself, but it lacks the compression and freshness expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with several lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“the blueprint drafting compass point felt heavy with cosmic possibility”). There is some redundancy and adjective stacking (“pressing darkness that seemed to close in,” “felt both terror and exhilaration”) that could be trimmed for crisper impact. Metaphors generally hold and don’t conflict, though a few phrases lean on familiar formulations (“burned bright,” “beyond imagination”). Momentum remains intact, with no major loops or artifacts obscuring sense, but tightening would be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean, readable, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (the gold-and-silver ribbon catching dim light; fingers tracing rock). At times, it edges into over-stated or redundant language (“furrowed hush” appears twice; several abstract formulations stand where concrete beats could work harder), but clarity is rarely compromised. The summary-heavy ending compresses pivotal events into exposition, which is economical but also flattens what could have been a sharper, scene-based climax.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, syntactically varied, and easy to follow, with some effective phrases (“preserved underground like forgotten treasure”). There is some mild redundancy and a tendency toward abstract summary in thematic lines, but not enough to drag momentum significantly. Figurative language is used sparingly and mostly coherently. The final paragraph is clear and rhythmic, even if a bit expository in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with effective rhythmic variation and some striking images (pixelated dissolution, clouds as question marks). However, it edges into purple and repetitive territory: phrases like “scaffold wrap flutters,” “pixelated amnesty,” and “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” recur with diminishing marginal return. Abstraction stacks (“transformation and transfiguration,” “music, memory, and mercy”) sometimes dilute precision and momentum. Despite this, clarity remains high and most sentences are doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally concise, with a few strong images (“scarlet and gold peeling paint,” “dusky harmony”) and efficient scene-setting. There is some scaffold and concept repetition—phrases and structures recur in adjacent sentences without adding pressure, particularly around calm, territory, and the foreign money—which slightly blunts momentum. Explanatory sentences sometimes restate what the images already imply (e.g., reiterating the symbolic function of objects he’s just described). The line-level work is solid but not yet compressed or surprising enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and generally economical, with a good sense of sentence rhythm and no major syntactic or grammatical issues. Occasional phrases are evocative (the “daylily-pressed telegram,” “soft light of understanding dawning”), and information is delivered without obvious loops or scaffolding. There is some repetition of abstract diction around “understanding,” “wisdom,” and “healing,” and a mild tendency to tell emotional or thematic beats rather than embody them. Still, line-level craft does not impede momentum or clarity, even if it seldom surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with mostly clear sequencing and a good balance between action and description. Some lines do double duty—advancing magic mechanics while reinforcing theme—and the imagery of circles, ice, and vortex is neatly patterned. That said, there is noticeable repetition of key nouns and phrases and some reliance on generic abstractions (“ancient magic,” “forbidden magic,” “desperate love”) that dilute precision. While not purple, the density of similar constructions and epigrammatic closing lines gives a slightly over-summarized, less immediate feel at crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mostly clear and fluid, with some strong images (e.g., “shimmering blue threads weaving together into a tapestry of dreams”). There is a tendency toward repetition of key phrases (“anxious elation,” “cobalt,” “intersection of dreams”) and conceptual telling, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; it skirts purple without fully tipping over. Line-level work is competent, but information density and variance could be sharper for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and character work simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme; redundancy (“fierce gentleness”/“fiercely gentle”) and occasional purple-leaning abstractions modestly dull the sharpness of some beats. The single typo and a few near-synonymic echoes slightly disrupt polish but do not hinder understanding or closure. Overall, the prose would need only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is fluent, largely free of redundancy, and balances concrete detail with interiority; many sentences do double duty (technical fact plus emotional charge). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are few if any outright clunky lines. Some metaphors and explanations are a shade on-the-nose or repeated in concept (quarry as emptiness, “echo valley”), but they don’t seriously slow momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally fluent, with varied syntax, strong nouns and verbs, and images that pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the seed’s “second heartbeat,” the arbor as heat mirage). Information density is high without major redundancy, and scaffolding sentences are minimal. A few abstract, multi-clause lines and repeated conceptual phrases (“physics of transition,” “magnetic field”) lean toward mild overwriting, but they do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally clean and economical, with few redundancies and mostly precise, evocative images (e.g., “cold fire that only consumed paper and ink, not the warmth of memories or emotions”). Metaphoric threads around tides, metal, and identity are consistent and not overstacked to the point of purple prose. There is some conceptual repetition (“after tomorrow disappears,” “contradiction”) and a faint explanatory tilt, but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Rhythm and syntax feel composed and controlled enough for a high-level market.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-by-line craft is generally clean, with varied syntax and a strong ear for rhythm and echo (“resonant hush,” “heartbeat of a hesitation”). Some phrases recur or cluster (“latent radiance,” “abandoned hopes,” “walls between hearts”) in ways that feel a bit slogan-like, and several sentences paraphrase prior ideas rather than advancing them. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; it brushes purple without fully obscuring meaning. Overall momentum holds, though trimming some explanatory lines would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, with many lines doing double duty for mood and information (“words began to reveal themselves like archaeological strata” is a standout). Line-level clarity is good; sentences connect logically and maintain momentum across the scene. However, there is some figurative stacking and paraphrastic repetition (rivers/diversions/self-forgiveness/medication) that verges on purple and slightly blunts impact, especially near the ending. Tightening those redundancies and pruning on-the-nose metaphors would sharpen an already strong surface.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with minimal redundancy and strong information density for this length. Imagery (“mist clung to ancient oaks like spectral garments,” “walls…made of condensed mist with a soft internal luminescence”) is vivid without tipping into incoherent purple. There is some conceptual repetition around “unspoken words” and “library” but not enough to drag momentum or blur meaning. Line-level control remains solid through the ending, with no noticeable syntactic artifacts or mixed metaphors dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and stakes), and there are few if any true scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphoric richness (“fruit left too long on the branch,” “perforated destiny,” “mulberry-hued drapes”) usually sharpens rather than blurs sense, though density is high enough that trimming could increase punch for publication. Syntax is varied, transitions are smooth, and causality remains clear through the climactic ritual. The prose sits near the edge of purple but mostly justifies its lushness with precision and thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is smooth and readable, with clear sequencing and few true clutter sentences. Imagery of light, crystals, static, and weaving patterns builds a coherent texture, and most sentences carry at least two jobs (setting plus mood, action plus concept). Yet there is some purple repetition (“radiant hush,” “threshold of stillness,” multiple near-synonymous closures about purpose and preservation) and reliance on familiar abstractions. The overall rhythm is a bit uniform, contributing to a softening of momentum in what is already a low-conflict scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth and mostly clear, with some evocative lines and a readable rhythm; sentence and paragraph lengths vary enough to avoid monotony. Recurring images (scallop shells, vineyard hush, kindly decisiveness) sometimes cross from motif into mild redundancy without adding new pressure. A few constructions verge on purple or vague (“movements scalloped against the clouds”) but do not seriously obscure sense. Information density is decent, though several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about cycles and contentment, which slightly drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with good information density—most sentences do double duty as scene-setting and interior shading. Figurative language (e.g., the shard “absorbing the weight of secrets”) is generally precise and coherent, though the number of reiterated metaphors around doubt and reflection comes close to feeling slightly over-explicit. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is steady across reflection-heavy passages. Line-level clarity remains high, especially in transitions between action (handling chimes) and introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and readable, with generally clear sentence construction and minimal grammatical noise. However, there are paraphrase loops and phrasing redundancies (“Through the trance, Maya’s perception heightened…” vs. later “Through the trance, Elien watched his student transform”) that add scaffolding without new information. Several sentences summarize what’s already evident in the scene (“The floating rock platform, the magnetic grotto, the starlight, the ripples—all had served their purpose”), dulling momentum. Tightening these repetitions and trusting images over explanation would materially elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is fluid and largely grammatical, with strong sensory and imagistic moments (“shadows that danced where ancestors had walked,” “ripples across an infinite pond”). At times it tips into purple and abstract (“ritual as old as the stars themselves,” “endless history”), with a dense concentration of modifiers and similar cadences that can blunt impact. There are some mild paraphrase/redundancy patterns but nothing that obscures causality or the ending. Tighter line-editing to cut stock cosmic phrases and sharpen concrete beats would significantly raise the craft level.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, with good rhythm, clear syntax, and minimal scaffolding or repetition; most lines do more than one job by fusing worldbuilding with mood or theme. Figurative language is present but not overwhelmingly dense, and core phrases (like “brilliant dimness”) recur in purposeful ways rather than as decorative clutter. Some abstractions (“algorithmic enchantments,” “systematic magic,” “authentic connection”) could be grounded more in concrete image or action to heighten immediacy. Overall, the prose is above-average and unobtrusive, but not yet sharp or surprising enough—especially in peak beats—to reach elite literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“meteor hush of anticipation,” “robes woven from threads of starlight and seawater”), with good sentence variety and momentum. Most lines do double duty in advancing image and mood, and there is little scaffolding or repetition. At times the figurative density nudges toward purple, and a few metaphors feel slightly over-engineered, but they rarely impede clarity. Line-level craft is strong, just short of the rigor and sharpness a top-tier market typically demands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and readable, with some strong images (“ambered observatory deck,” “coins formed a perfect spiral”). There is noticeable repetition of certain phrases and titles (“cast lots decision maker,” “quiet enthusiasm,” “stellar doubt”), and abstraction sometimes substitutes for concrete sensory or emotional detail. Figurative language is present but not overbearing; momentum holds, though a few lines restate already-known stakes. Line-level craft is competent but not yet tightened to elite-publication sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative imagery tied to character and setting. Some lines veer toward purple or redundant motif use (“echo of sacrifice,” “scattered light” recurs often without always adding new nuance). Syntax and grammar are clean, and most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme). Trimming a few ornamental metaphors and near-duplicate sentiments would sharpen momentum and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and story. Occasional purple tendencies (“sound like settling stars,” “liquid sky,” “plausible weaving of reality’s threads”) are mostly coherent but verge on over-rich when stacked. There’s some conceptual repetition around “brittle devotion” and the lukewarm motif, but not enough to stall momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publishable, though a light paring of abstractions and explicit moral phrasing would tighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, and several lines (“history slowly revealed itself like a secret being whispered”) carry genuine lyricism. There is some scaffolding and conceptual redundancy—phrases like “precisely humane approach,” “spin stories into shared meaning,” and repeated invocations of “narrative” and “silenced” lean abstract. Description occasionally clusters into slightly purple sequences but doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Tighter, more concrete wording in key beats would sharpen momentum and reduce the sense of thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mostly clean and readable, with some lovely images (“auburn hair...like molten copper,” “blue fire that burned without consuming”) and clear sentence mechanics. At the same time, modifiers and figurative phrasing accumulate to the edge of purple, and certain ideas are reiterated (her goal, the significance of this moment, the harmony of logic and intuition) without adding new pressure. The cadence tends toward uniform, medium-length sentences, so momentum is more floaty than propulsive. Trimming redundancy and varying rhythm would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically competent, and many lines do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Yet there is significant repetition of structures and phrases, occasional paraphrase loops, and a reliance on similar abstract formulations (“silent language,” “soundless echo,” “burden”) that dilute impact. Figurative language is generally safe but skews generic, and high-pressure beats are narrated at roughly the same tempo and texture as calm ones. While publishable with revision, it lacks the concision and precision expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with reasonably varied sentence structures and no serious clarity errors. Still, it leans into repetition and abstraction: phrases like “truth in its rawest form,” “fundamental dualities that underpinned reality itself,” and repeated restatements of stakes (clone custody battle, numbness vs feeling) create a sense of explanation rather than compressed, image-driven drama. The closing paragraphs summarize future legal and public battles instead of letting a single charged image or moment carry that weight. Overall, it’s solid but somewhat over-explicit and expository for its length and ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with some pleasing images (the brook “flow[ing] with silver in the darkness”). At the same time, there is noticeable redundancy—phrases like “hush of possibility,” “storm-born silence,” and variations on “flow” recur without adding new shades of meaning. The language drifts toward purple at times, stacking abstractions (“canvas for something extraordinary, just waiting to flow into being”) that dilute impact. Line-level craft is competent but not incisive or ruthlessly compressed enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose often carries rich, atmospheric weight and uses several images to do double duty for setting and emotion, and the narrative is grammatically clean and clear. Yet there is notable redundancy and paraphrase looping: core phrases and concepts are restated with only slight variation, and modifiers accumulate (“mournfully eager,” “true haunting,” “artificial wind”) in ways that occasionally feel like purple layering rather than new information. The repeated incantatory clause “via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” in particular reads more like template reuse than earned refrain. Line-level craft is solid but needs tightening and pruning for concision and sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines multitasking—worldbuilding, mood, and theme in one sentence—and a good rhythmic flow across paragraphs. Imagery around light, mist, and dimensional overlays is striking and usually clear. However, there is some conceptual repetition (“boundaries of light,” “uncertainty,” “dimensions”) and a tendency toward abstraction that could be tightened for sharper impact. The density of figurative and philosophical language occasionally flirts with overwriting but doesn’t significantly obscure causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and high-density, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous and often layered—“frozen bloom,” “trapped fireflies,” “winter finding purchase in autumn’s resistance”—which borders on purple and occasionally dilutes clarity and impact. There is some conceptual repetition (“successive approximation,” “creative destruction,” “stifling destiny”) that feels like thematic scaffolding rather than fresh observation. Despite these issues, momentum is maintained and the final images are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is mostly clean and clear, with smooth sentences and reasonably efficient paragraphs; there are few outright clunkers. Some phrasing and imagery are repeated (“serenely electric,” reiterations of assumptions/noise/silence), and there’s a mild tendency toward abstract or summary language at emotional peaks. Figurative language is controlled enough not to obscure sense, but the line-level work doesn’t surprise or compress meaning as strongly as the premise invites. Overall craft is solid mid-tier but short of elite literary sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clear, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some striking images (the hourglass, three moons, frozen-time stalactites). There is a mild tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“resiliently positive,” repeated motif explanations) and abstract summary in places. Still, sentences generally carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus mood plus plot), and there are no major loops or figurative muddles that obscure action. Momentum holds through to the conclusion despite occasional ornamental flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with some nicely compact images (“memories that branched out like an infinite tree”) and few outright errors, though one slip like “Colors that had once were vibrant” stands out. There is some scaffold and conceptual redundancy (e.g., restating the gallery’s function and Elias’s beliefs) and a reliance on abstract nouns (“deeper truths,” “shared experience,” “texture of connection”) where a more concrete lexicon could carry weight. Figurative language is moderate rather than purple, but several phrases lean generic (“profoundly true,” “comforted and disturbed”). Line by line, the writing is solid but not razor‑tight or texturally surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some striking images (e.g., algae like “terrestrial stars” and “bioluminescent fire”). Information density is decent, but paragraphs often carry redundant conceptual weight, restating ideas of connection, horizons, and bending light. There is a tendency toward abstraction and mild purple-tinge, with repeated phrase structures that slightly dull momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved, and no major figurative muddles harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally concise, with a good balance between description and forward motion. Lines often carry multiple functions (world-building plus mood plus plot), and there are few obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. Some phrasing trends toward repetition or mild purple (“reeling hush,” “ethereal fog,” reiterated “persistently curious”), and a few explanatory lines could be trimmed without loss. Overall, though, momentum and clarity are preserved, and the closure beat lands without being muddied by over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with good information density—most sentences carry both atmosphere and story. There are a few slightly familiar or decorative turns (“yawned before her like a tired giant,” “damp air licked at Elara’s skin”), but they don’t accumulate enough to drag momentum or obscure sense. Expository lines about the facility’s history and Thorne are brief and integrated into the ongoing action. Syntax is varied, grammar clean, and the final line lands with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, with competent rhythm and a good ratio of concrete image to abstraction; sentences generally pull their weight and maintain momentum in a reflective mode. There are mild paraphrase loops and some thematic redundancy, especially around “failure” and “between worlds,” and a few phrases verge on stock. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not overstacked, though sometimes leans toward the familiar rather than surprising. Overall, solid prose that could be tightened and sharpened for top-tier submission.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is fluent and often beautiful, with strong metaphorical choices (“towers of bone,” “canvas of his craft”) and good information density per sentence. There is some mild redundancy and explanatory phrasing in the later summary-style lines, but little true scaffolding or looped restatement. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and clarity is never in doubt. Slightly less telling in the final paragraph would sharpen the impact, but line-level craft is above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: rhythms vary, imagery is generally clean, and most lines are doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once). There is some repetition of signature phrases and abstracted formulations (“harmony untamed,” “cosmic joke,” “frostbitten hope”) that slightly dulls their impact. Figurative language is dense but usually coherent, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A minor tightening of redundancies and a touch more concrete action in key beats would bring this closer to elite-line quality.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, with rhythmic variety and some strong images (“gears bloomed into intricate patterns,” “roots glowing with captured moonlight”). There is occasional redundancy and a tendency toward slightly purple, abstract phrases that don’t always add precision (“mechanical reality,” repeated formulations about beauty and wonder). The closing montage compresses large changes into expository lines, which flattens momentum and dilutes the final image’s sharpness. Overall, the prose is solid and readable but not yet at elite, cut-to-the-bone refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with several strong images (contained lightning casting shadows; “network that operated in the silence between beats”). Repetition around certain abstractions (hope, broken promises, glue) and slightly over-explanatory lines in the final third introduce mild redundancy. Figurative language is mostly apt and not over-stacked, and there are no major clarity or grammar issues. Trimming some conceptual restatements would sharpen momentum and let the best images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and a good sense of musicality; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus theme, or setting plus emotion). There is some abstraction and repetition of key phrases (silence as language/possibility, “whispering gleam”), but it stops short of full purple prose or paraphrase loops. Syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and clarity remains high even when the language grows ornate. A slightly lighter hand on explicit thematic turns and stacked modifiers would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, and metaphors fit the world (curved space, analog memories, living text). Some phrasing and concepts recur a bit too often (“sanely eccentric,” “observed solitude,” reiterations of the central idea), creating a faint sense of redundancy. The density of figurative language is high but mostly controlled; only occasionally does it feel like ornament rather than pressure. With a slight tightening of repeated concepts and a touch more syntactic variety, this would approach elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level writing is polished: sentences are clear, varied in length, and generally economical for the lyrical mode, with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and supportive of tone; it doesn’t muddle sense. A few constructions verge on abstraction or repetition (e.g., multiple formulations of the islands “holding their breath” or light carrying emotion) but don’t significantly drag momentum. There are no glaring grammatical or syntactic slips, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often striking (“threshold moment that existed between heartbeats, outside ordinary time”). Most sentences do more than one job—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere. There is some purple, abstract language and repetition of similar conceptual metaphors (“cosmic possibility,” “human potential,” “exquisite agony of a thought struggling to be born”) that could be pared for greater impact. Overall, line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-honed enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluid, with varied sentence structures and strong, concrete imagery (e.g., ship hulls as “skeletons surrendering to the persistent encroachment of nature”). Most sentences do double duty—advancing setting and character—and there’s little scaffolding or repetition that drags momentum. Some phrases verge on abstraction or redundancy (“chronically curious nature” appears twice; several sentences summarize realizations), and a few thematic lines could be tightened. Still, rhythm and clarity are strong, and no major artifacts or figurative muddles blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with good information density and images that do multiple jobs (the playground swing simile, the dancing shadow, the wavering outline). A few lines edge toward purple or explanatory summary (“his motivation to mentor resilience quietly had drawn many desperate seekers”), slightly sapping immediacy. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not overstacked; the text avoids major synonym loops or clunky scaffolding. The cadence is occasionally uniform in its long, clause-rich sentences, but not enough to drag momentum in such a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level prose is clean, grammatical, and often musical, with a steady cadence that reads smoothly aloud. However, there is noticeable repetition and mild overwriting: phrases like “verdant parapet beside the waterfall,” “insatiably creative,” and “between worlds” recur without always adding new pressure or insight, creating a sense of template lyricism. Figurative language leans safe and familiar rather than startling or precise, and some sentences simply restate prior content about wonder and essence. Competent and pleasant, but not yet at the density, freshness, and economy expected for immediate high-end publication.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level prose is polished and rhythmic, with generally precise syntax and few, if any, true artifacts or redundancies; most sentences carry both image and function. The figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (fractures, nets, snowflakes, masks), and it doesn’t significantly obscure action or causality. There is some repetition of key coined phrases (“interlaced hush,” “lucid unrest”) that borders on self-conscious, but it mostly reads as motif rather than loop. Momentum is steady for a quiet piece, with no major scaffolding or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean, fluid, and rhythmically varied, with strong images like the rain-scoured frescoes and the deliberately torn map. Sentences often carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without obvious clutter. There is some redundancy and mild abstraction (“profound sense of shielded openness,” “most profound cartography…in the human heart”) that edges toward platitude. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and clarity remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and mostly economical, with several lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There are occasional redundancies and expository restatements (e.g., reiterating what the water “is” symbolically) that could be pared back for sharper impact. Figurative language is coherent but sometimes leans toward explaining its own symbolism rather than letting images stand. Momentum holds across the piece, but a light trim of explanatory phrases would raise density and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some striking phrases (“time stretches like taffy,” “digital palimpsests”) and a consistent rhythmic ease. At the same time, there is a tendency toward repetitious sentence structures and explanatory phrasing that flattens immediacy into summary. Figurative density sometimes approaches purple—piling concepts like “ethereal realm,” “liminal space of data,” and “tinkersong wonder” without always adding new precision. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-tight; a judicious pruning of abstractions and reiterations would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, with a few strong images (crystalline walls fracturing light, ice crystals mirroring coded writing) and an orderly rhythmic progression via the floor markers. However, there is some redundancy (reiterating her failed decryption and her mission to find joy in anguish) and a drift into abstract, thematic language in the final third. Minor issues like the stray “化作” and slightly stock formulations (“the deepest truths often unfold in the quietest moments”) blunt the edge of the line-level craft. Overall momentum is maintained, but the language could be sharper and less expository near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density—many lines carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the telescope’s weight “anchoring” her purpose). Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful, and repetition of key phrases (“dusty starlight,” “empty spaces remember”) builds motif rather than feeling purely redundant, though a touch of trimming would sharpen impact. There is some tendency toward over-explanation in the final third, where concepts are named after they’ve already been dramatized. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and image-work remain solid throughout, with no major loops or artifacts dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information (“constellations on the floor that seemed to shift with each passing moment” is a strong example). Line-level clarity is high; actions and perceptions are easy to follow, and there are no major syntactic or metaphorical tangles. Some sentences in the latter half slip into explanatory redundancy or thematic scaffolding, slightly dulling momentum. Still, there is no significant looping or purple-stacked imagery that materially harms the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatical and readable, with a smooth, even rhythm and no major muddle. Yet there’s notable redundancy in concept and phrasing (repeated re-statements of his discovery and its significance) and a tendency to explain what images already imply. Many sentences carry a similar cadence and level of abstraction, which flattens energy. Line-level refinement—sharper cuts, more concrete verbs, and less scaffolding—would significantly tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, mostly well-shaped, and information-dense, with concrete images like “ice crystallized on ancient bookshelves” and “rainbow reflections across the hall of mirrors.” However, metaphoric language is almost constant (“driftwood nostalgia,” “shore of time,” “returning to sea”), creating a faint purple sheen and some redundancy without additional pressure. Momentum survives, but a leaner line would sharpen the emotional beats. There are no major clarity issues or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line by line, the prose is competent and mostly concise, with few outright redundancies or syntax errors. Imagery is occasionally strong but tends toward repetition and mild purple (e.g., repeated invocations of arches, nebula, and “strangers to family” without new nuance). Many key beats are summarized in broad strokes instead of rendered in scene, which keeps momentum smooth but robs pivotal moments of vividness. Still, there are no major artifacts or figurative muddles that obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong information density—most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Some figurative language edges toward purple or repetition (“bruised” colors, reiterated “beautifully flawed,” nested-pattern phrasing), but it rarely obscures sense. Momentum holds across the scene, with few scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The lushness is a strength overall, though a harsher market might want a bit more restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and readable with solid grammar and mostly clear sequencing. However, there is noticeable redundancy and scaffold (“Elias knew he must act…,” then later similar reminders), along with familiar emotional shorthand (“heavy heart,” “felt at peace”) and some mildly purple turns that don’t add precision. Sentences tend toward a similar rhythm, giving the piece a somewhat flat cadence during what should be high-pressure beats. Line-level craft is competent but not yet compressed or incisive enough for top venues.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise, with strong information density—most sentences advance emotion, setting, or theme. The recurring figurative frame (river as polymers/relationships, chrysalis as self) is coherent and rarely muddled. There is some repetition of insight (“not loss but transformation,” “science and art… could harmonize”) and a mild tendency toward sentimental phrasing that slightly blunts sharpness. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and the closing images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished, with rich imagery and mostly clean syntax; nearly every sentence carries atmosphere or world-building work. There is some repetition of structures and modifiers, and figurative density occasionally edges into purple, risking a softening of impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and there are few if any genuine artifacts or loops that stall momentum. Tightening a handful of over-elaborate lines would likely elevate this to top-tier readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean, generally concise, and maintains momentum, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information. Imagery is coherent and thematically aligned, and there are no major clarity issues or figurative muddles. However, adjective and phrase repetition (“brittle,” “sturdy,” “stored remorse”) and some parallel sentence constructions create a mild sense of scaffolding and sameness. A slightly sharper line edit could heighten impact by trimming redundancy and varying rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some pleasant turns of phrase (“borrowed starlight,” “beating heart of a revitalized community”). There is a notable tendency toward abstract, adjective-heavy constructions (“empathetically decisive grace,” “vigorous tender spirit”) and occasional redundancy (reiterating her role as “harmonious choral librarian”). Momentum suffers slightly from summary sections that tell emotional outcomes rather than dramatizing them. Overall, the line-level work is solid but somewhat generic and occasionally purple for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, generally clear, and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. There is some purple/abstract language and conceptual redundancy (e.g., reiterations of “profound transformation,” “quaking reverie,” and restating the same thematic insight). Most metaphors are internally consistent and on-theme, but density of figurative phrasing occasionally slows momentum. Line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with light tightening, but not yet razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a competent rhythm and no major artifacts or muddle. Information density is decent, though some phrases and concepts (“latent blaze,” “clandestinely luminous,” restated stakes) recur without adding new pressure. Many key actions (“worked through each puzzle,” “final combination lock clicked into place”) are summarized rather than rendered with concrete detail, reducing immediacy. The line-level craft is solid but a bit safe and expository, lacking the compression or surprising imagery that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    The line-level writing is polished: imagery is sharp (“fog clung to branches like whispered secrets”), sentences carry multiple jobs, and there’s little evident scaffolding or redundancy. While the prose leans lush and metaphor-rich, it generally avoids mixed metaphors or purple overload, and the rhythm supports the contemplative pace. Minor risks of over-decoration in middle beats do not materially blunt clarity or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and paced appropriately, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme). A few outright repetitions and near-duplicate lines (“Elias was thoughtfully precise…”, the motivation sentence) read as scaffold rather than intentional pattern. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, though occasionally abstract (“translating silence” leans conceptual). Momentum holds; there is little dead weight, but the line-level does not yet feel sharpened to elite-literary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and economical, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (world-building plus interiority, or theme plus action). Occasional repetition (“shadowed workshop under stars,” explanatory restatements of her philosophy) and slightly purple phrases soften momentum but do not obscure meaning. Figurative language leans consistent (vibration, resonance, silence) rather than scattershot, which aids clarity. The line-level craft is solidly publishable with minor tightening, though it lacks the compression and surprise characteristic of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatically clean, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm that suits the contemplative mode. There are effective images and some multi-job sentences, but the density of modifiers and neologistic abstractions (“turning of the tide’s thought,” “journalize project”) can feel slightly ornamental rather than precise. A few redundancies and near-echoes (“olfactorily sensitive senses,” reiteration of phrases like “wildflower hush”) create mild purple overtones without adding pressure. Line-level craft is competent but not yet at the razor-sharp concision expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and easy to follow, with solid rhythm and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some phrases and constructions recur (“whirling silence,” “as” clauses) and a few lines drift toward mild purple, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Information density is decent; most sentences advance atmosphere or plot. The closure image is clear and uncluttered, though line-level craft lacks the compression or surprising phrasing of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally well-paced, with clear sentences and a readable rhythm. Description often does double duty, conveying mood and information (e.g., warped containers and wind behavior). There is some mild redundancy and abstraction, especially around key phrases and mission statements, that could be tightened to increase impact. Figurative language is restrained enough not to muddle sense, though the line-level could be sharpened further for elite-literary immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are grammatical and fluent, and the prose reads aloud smoothly without confusion. However, figurative language is dense and sometimes redundant, with multiple cosmic or mystical metaphors stacked in close succession, which blunts impact (“clarion call of distant stars,” “woven from starlight,” “lotus,” etc.). Abstract nouns and similar syntactic shapes create a mild sense of purple, low-propulsion texture rather than sharp, efficient line-level craft. While not clumsy, the prose could be tightened and made more particular to lift it to top-tier literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: syntax is clear, imagery is controlled, and most sentences do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion or action). Some phrases veer toward purple or repetitive (e.g., “avalanchingly quiet,” reiterated hush/quiet motifs, slightly heavy-handed “sacred work”), and a few insights are told where the scene already shows them. These issues create mild density drag rather than real confusion. Overall momentum holds and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-shaped, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or obvious loops. Some late exposition (“Her research notebooks filled with graphs…”) tells what previous images have already implied, and a few constructions verge on abstract or repetitive. Figurative language is mostly controlled and thematically aligned (stars, equations, light) without purple excess. The line-level work is above average but not yet razor-honed for maximal compression and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is mostly clean and fluid, with a good mix of sentence lengths and some efficient, multi-purpose lines (e.g., the pendant both lighting and timing the extended encounters). Repetition of phrases like “vibrating sympathetically,” “germinate,” and “extend brief encounters” operates more as motif than artifact, though occasionally it edges toward redundancy. There is some mild overwriting and explanatory scaffolding in the final paragraphs, where thematic statements are spelled out rather than implied. Overall, line-level craft is solid and publishable but would benefit from tightening and trusting the images more.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly concise, with a solid sense of image and no major metaphor clashes. Some sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, character), giving decent information density. That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and constructions, and several abstract summaries could be tightened or made more concrete. The language is effective but not especially sharp or surprising at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical or syntactic errors, and many lines pull double duty for mood and information. However, figurative language is fairly dense and occasionally tips into purple or repetitive metaphor (“unraveling tapestry,” “threads,” “hush”) without always adding new facets, creating a slight sense of over-decoration. Some phrasing veers into abstraction or summary at high-pressure beats (“its latent sacrifice becoming apparent”) instead of grounding in concrete sensation. Momentum remains acceptable, but sharper pruning and a bit more specificity over ornamentation would strengthen line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level writing is mostly smooth and clear, with good economy; each line tends to carry character, world, and theme together. There are a few small redundancies and echoing stems (“his movements imbued with purpose…His hands moved with purpose”), and some phrases lean toward thematic abstraction. Figurative language is light and generally apt, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple overload. Overall momentum is steady, and the final image lands cleanly at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is smooth, readable, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (“tools frozen in mid-project as if time itself had paused”). There is light repetition of phrasing (“half-remembered,” “weave between worlds”) and some summarizing of key beats (“they learned to redirect the flows”) where scene could sharpen impact. Figurative language is mostly clean and not overstacked. Line-level control is solidly publication-ready, though not pushing into truly distinctive music.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: clean grammar, varied syntax, good information density, and vivid yet economical figurative language. Many sentences perform double duty, advancing both atmosphere and character (e.g., his lantern casting “dancing shadows that seemed to move independently of their source”). There is minor redundancy and abstraction in the closing stretch (“emotional shelter in a lineage of quiet guardians”), where the prose briefly tells what the images already show. Nonetheless, there are no significant loops or artifacts, and momentum from outage to revelation to departure is well maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is often striking without being opaque, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion plus action). There is some repetition of phrases and concepts (e.g., variants of “ancient shadows,” “new dawn,” reaffirming her role) that could be tightened for higher density. The odd insertion “室白鲟” reads like a glitch rather than intentional diction and briefly disrupts the otherwise clean flow. Overall, the piece maintains clarity and momentum, but it stops just short of the ruthless compression and absolute polish expected at a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is smooth, grammatical, and visually and conceptually clear, with effective recurring imagery (light, mist, iridescence) doing double duty for setting and theme. Some phrases and constructions recur (“quietly explosive,” “tracking sun trails”), but not so often as to feel like obvious scaffolding or loops. The figurative language mostly lands and stays coherent with the established metaphoric field of light and color; purple tendencies are present but controlled. Information density is good, and nearly every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the central concept without major slack.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong information density—most lines are doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or characterization plus theme). At times it leans into mild purple-prose density and conceptual repetition (“quantified sorrow,” “units of lost hope,” “unresolved grief”), and several sentences summarize interior states instead of embodying them. Still, clarity is never lost, and no major scaffold or synonym loops sap momentum. The closing paragraphs manage a poised, clear image without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with several strong images (starlight fruit, lullaby “hanging in the air like visible light”). Some lines veer into explanatory or repetitive territory, restating concepts about community, bonds, and bound release rather than advancing the moment. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, though it risks feeling slightly generic-lyrical. Overall momentum holds, but a tighter, more image-driven line edit would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and largely free of outright clutter, and the paragraphs move logically from idea to idea. However, there are paraphrase loops and reiterations of key phrases (“nested paradoxes,” “enlarged tranquility,” “wisdom”) that create a slightly sermon-like cadence. Abstract nouns and generalized phrasing often substitute for concrete image and action, flattening momentum. Line-level craft is solidly functional but lacks the compression, specificity, and rhythmic sharpness expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (the smell of “yeast and warmth and vanished bakers,” rain welcomed by the garden). Minor errors (“Elima” for Eliza, “fall,drops”) and a few paraphrastic or slightly redundant constructions keep it below top tier. The prose leans descriptive-lyric without tipping into purple, but there is room to tighten phrasing and cut explicit explanation where the imagery already carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean: sentences are grammatical, clear, and often carry both atmosphere and information. Metaphors like “quartz hush” and “captured starlight” are coherent and on-theme, and there are few outright redundancies that stall momentum. That said, some concepts and phrases recur with little new pressure (“gently meticulous,” the fading of illusions, the edge of oblivion), and many sentences share similar length and structure, creating a mild droning effect. Trimming repetition and varying rhythm would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences carry multiple loads of setting, character, and motion. Figurative language is controlled and mostly effective, with only a few phrases leaning toward reiteration rather than fresh insight. Syntax varies enough to keep the line-level flow from feeling mechanical. There are no major clarity issues or artifacts that blunt the impact of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, imagery is vivid, and the rhythm supports a lyric, contemplative mode. The taste metaphors and cosmic-weather language mostly land, and clarity is preserved throughout. That said, certain phrases (“terrestrially cosmic energies,” “futuristic nostalgia”) recur and verge on purple or conceptual redundancy, and some insights are told where an image could carry them. Trimming a few explanatory lines and tightening repetition would bring the prose closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often elegant and rhythmically pleasing, with several lines doing double duty for mood and meaning. However, figurative language and abstract modifiers are densely stacked, which sometimes drifts into purple territory and produces redundancy (“auroral sorrow,” “luminous regret,” “creative fire,” “uncork suppressed creativity,” “broken combination lock of his creativity”). A few sentences reiterate the same idea in slightly different metaphors, lowering information density and momentum. Line-level polish trimming mixed metaphors and repeated conceptual phrases would noticeably lift the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clear and fluid, with some strong images (“desperate botanical life raft,” “evaporated tears”) and efficient exposition. There is mild redundancy and abstraction in the thematic statements and a touch of purple in the closing reflections, but nothing that obscures sense or momentum. Information density is good for this length, though a few lines summarize what the imagery has already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, with pleasant rhythm and mostly efficient sentences that advance idea or image. Some abstractions and repeated formulations (“symphonies of truth,” “silent language of resonant light,” “color of wonder”) create a mild sense of conceptual redundancy. Description tends toward the lyrical but stops short of opaque purple prose, and causality remains clear. Tighter, more concrete language at a few key beats—especially around Elara’s labor and the final spectrum—would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, with good information density and images that do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Sentence rhythms vary enough to maintain momentum, and there are few, if any, true paraphrase loops. Some modifiers and repeated constructions (“strangely organic,” several near-synonymous articulations of the same transformation) lightly verge on overstatement, but they don’t obscure sense or blunt the ending. Figurative language is restrained and mostly coherent, supporting rather than overwhelming the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear and easy to follow, with mostly efficient sentences and few outright artifacts. There is some repetition and abstraction—phrases like “when the outside world intruded” and “through neighborhood storytelling” recur as slogans more than textured experiences. Telling often replaces scene work in key beats, especially around Leo’s realizations and the community’s “healing,” which flattens momentum. Still, rhythm and syntax are varied enough, and no figurative muddle or heavy scaffolding significantly harms clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some strong individual lines and images. However, there is noticeable repetition of metaphors (“as a spider spins its web” appears twice) and theme-label sentences that function as scaffolding. The final third leans heavily on summary and abstract commentary, which flattens momentum and emotional immediacy. Figurative language is frequent but not always doing new work, edging toward mild overwriting rather than dense precision.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence structures, clear syntax, and a good ratio of image to information; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without bloat. A few expressions flirt with purple or redundancy (repeated “gleaming silence,” crystal facets “defying physics” after we already know they’re extraordinary), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. There are no glaring loops, scaffolding remnants, or muddled metaphors, and the closure image is sharp. The prose could still be tightened slightly for compression and surprise to reach elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and clear, with some attractive images (the brook’s sound “like breathing,” the wing becoming translucent where prophecy touches). However, line-level redundancy and adjective-heavy constructions (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze”) recur without new nuance, softening impact. Many sentences perform similar atmospheric work instead of advancing action, creating a mild sense of looped texture. The overall effect is competent but slightly overwrought for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level writing is polished and mostly concise, with a few memorable images (“meteors streaked across the darkness, ephemeral as forgotten words”) and good rhythm. There’s little in the way of redundancy or mechanical scaffolding, and sentences tend to do double duty for mood and information. At times the prose leans a bit summary-ish and safe rather than taking sharper, riskier turns of phrase, but there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong rhythm and a clear ear for cadence; most sentences carry both mood and information. At the same time, the density of modifiers and abstractions (“ethereal blue light,” “ghostly resolve,” “dangerous knowledge,” “quarantined memories”) produces a mild purple-prose effect and some conceptual redundancy across lines. Several sentences paraphrase the same insight in slightly different language, especially around isolation/independence and Elara’s radiance, which flattens momentum. Despite these issues, clarity is maintained throughout and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and well controlled; images such as the ink remaining “vibrant despite the years” and the key dissolving into auroral light are effective. There is some repetition (“stalactites dripping,” “pearl twilight”) and a tendency toward slightly purple phrasing that leans on abstractions like “wisely enduring reflection” and “calibrated treason” without always grounding them. The final aphoristic lines read more like commentary than lived experience, softening the emotional edge of closure. Nonetheless, momentum holds, clarity is never in doubt, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level writing is clean, grammatical, and rhythmically smooth, with some attractive images (the light “neither star nor sun,” “serpentine nexus under starlight”). There is some repetition of key phrases and structures that functions partly as motif but also verges on redundancy (“reed-blown melancholy,” “progressive disclosure,” “While the universe hummed its secret song”). Abstraction and telling intrude where concrete dramatization would add energy, particularly in the middle. The prose is above-average and publishable with tightening, but not at the hyper-precise, lean standard of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with no major grammatical or syntactic issues and a clear forward motion. The prose occasionally leans into purple imagery (“altar of frozen tears,” “windows of connection”) and repeats key phrases, but not so much as to obscure sense. There is some summary scaffolding that compresses what could be key dramatic beats, yet this harms momentum more than clarity. At an elite level, one would expect a tighter pruning of repeated formulations and a more varied, intentional rhythmic patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally graceful, with strong images (“sea of ephemeral foam,” “stars fallen to earth”) and efficient, mostly clear sentences. Some lines tip toward purple or redundant philosophical framing, slightly slowing momentum and dulling impact near the end. Nevertheless, the rhythm varies, scaffolding is minimal, and information density is solid for a contemplative piece. Line-level craft is strong but not so razor-honed or surprising as to feel immediately publish-ready in a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically sound and generally clear, with straightforward syntax that keeps the narrative legible. There is some redundancy and list-like structuring (“She would… She would…”; repeated concern about sharing truth without revealing the location), and key actions are often told in a flat, summarizing way. Figurative language is sparse but functional; overall, the line-level work is competent but not especially compressed or dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and often do double duty with image and concept intertwined. Several images are memorable and grounded (cobalt glass, cobweb light patterns, ozone-stained fingers). There is some redundancy and conceptual repetition (signals, transmissions, variant allegiance) without new pressure, and certain phrases lean toward high-concept abstraction rather than concrete dramatization. Even so, momentum is not badly harmed, and the prose remains comfortably above most submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluent and often graceful, with effective images like “tiny performers in the theater of his solitary existence” and the carved musicians on the box. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, and most lines do double duty in setting tone and advancing situation. There is some redundancy and purple edging—reiterated wistfulness, piled modifiers, and explanatory follow-through after strong images (“He had done more than capture a sound; he had captured the essence of connection…”), which could be cut for greater sharpness. Nonetheless, clarity holds and no major artifacts or loops blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are mostly clear, varied, and purposeful, with good information density and strong verbs anchoring vivid images. There is occasional purple edging—stacked metaphors (“cracked like distant bones,” “blood-red horizon”) and repeated azure/thematic markers—that could be pared for greater sharpness. The prose avoids serious loops or scaffolding, and syntax largely supports momentum through the descent and ritual. A bit of figurative excess in high-pressure beats keeps this from the very top tier but does not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean, largely clear, and includes some strong images; sentences generally carry multiple functions (atmosphere plus worldbuilding). There is noticeable repetition of key phrases (“patient revolution,” “sculpting patience from impatience”) and concept-heavy lines that restate rather than deepen, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent, edging toward overexplanation in the closing moralizing passages. Rhythm and paragraphing are serviceable, though a tighter line edit could cut redundancy and sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is mostly clear and competent, with some strong images (the lantern’s “greenish patina and intricate metalwork,” the “satisfying click” in the tunnel). There is mild redundancy in phrasing around key motifs (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability,” “reverberate”) and occasional abstract summary where a more concrete beat would serve better. Sentences sometimes accumulate clauses in a way that slightly blunts momentum but does not obscure meaning. Line-level craft is above average but not yet at an elite, highly compressed level.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong, economical images (“reflection wavering in the grimy glass like a spirit trapped between worlds,” “vibrant hush”) and clean syntax. Sentences usually do double duty, blending mood, character, and action without obvious filler or loops. There is some mild repetition of phrasing and a few lines that edge toward the ornate or aphoristic, but they don’t obscure clarity or closure. Overall, line-level craft is clearly above average and publication-ready with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and fluent, with some striking images (the acid sea pausing, the infinite reflections in the kaleidoscope). Line-level redundancy and conceptual repetition (“its curiosity piqued,” “steadily curious nature,” reiterations of yearning and evolution) slightly blunt momentum. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled, but the density of similar abstractions near the end creates a faintly expository feel. Tightening repeated concepts and leaning more on concrete, embodied phrasing would lift this category.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is fluent and mostly clear, but it leans heavily on familiar metaphors and intensifiers (“silent scream,” “ghosts in the machine,” “static electricity of forbidden knowledge”), creating a purple, slightly repetitive surface. Several sentences restate the same emotional or atmospheric point with marginal new information, which slows momentum at this length. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough, yet information density could be higher if some ornamental language were pared back. For an elite market, the line-level work would need tightening and more original figurative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmically varied, and occasionally striking in imagery (shadows “like ink in water,” twilight-colored magic). There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose drift—stacked modifiers and abstract nouns—especially around thematic phrases and repeated concepts. Nonetheless, sentences usually carry more than one function (image + worldbuilding, or mood + character) and maintain forward momentum. No major loops or figurative muddles obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some strong images (“the drift-ice marina stretched before her, small boats trapped between jagged sheets of frozen water”). There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“windborne solace,” “beautiful transformations,” “trawled…memories”) that could be pared for sharpness. Line-level craft sustains mood but leans on telling and thematic summary in the final paragraphs rather than letting concrete images fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but suffers from paraphrase loops and repetition of key phrases without added nuance (e.g., multiple near-identical mentions of the bus departure, the pavilion, drawing parallels). Much of the language is abstract—“intersubjective understanding,” “conceptual parallels,” “rediscovering his purpose”—rather than concretely dramatized, which flattens momentum. Sentences often do only one job, explaining what the story has already implied. For a prestigious venue, the line-level craft would need tightening, more specificity, and less self-repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with syntactic variety and few outright missteps. However, the prose tends toward purple repetition of key abstractions (“wisdom,” “echo,” “peripheral awareness”) without always adding new information or pressure. Some sentences are overpacked with modifiers and invented terms, which can dampen immediacy. Momentum holds for a lyric piece, but trimming redundancy and sharpening images would markedly increase power.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm and some well-chosen phrases (“metal bones slowly being reclaimed by nature”). There is some repetition and abstraction—phrases like “energy,” “healing,” and “masterpiece of shared humanity” lean toward cliché and blur specificity. A few lines verge on purple (“the air thickened with the scent of healing”) but do not fully derail clarity or momentum. Tightening redundant formulations and grounding abstractions in more concrete action would elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and the opening and closing images are clean and vivid. Yet key phrases and constructions recur with little variation (“suspended hush,” “weathered innocence,” “testify through fractured sequences,” “pattern of growth”), creating a faint sense of lexical looping. Some metaphoric statements about language and hope are more abstract than the surrounding imagery and could be sharper if further grounded in concrete perception. The prose is above-average and publishable with tightening, but the repetition and occasional purple abstraction hold it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and purposeful, with only a few minor repetitions (e.g., “arranging driftwood as directional markers” and “he clung to the echoes”) that could be tightened. The imagery—fog, metal, driftwood, layered sighs—leans lyrical without tipping into opaque purple prose. There’s little scaffolding or synonym churn; most lines carry atmosphere and advancement together. The prose is strong and polished but not yet distinctive or compressed enough to feel truly top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are mostly clean, varied, and purposeful, with strong rhythm and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Key images (the spinning hand, clouds as ocean waves, “sound of a leaf falling”) are memorable and do multi-layered work. However, there is some purple-leaning abstraction and repetition (“luminous ache,” “ephemeral”) that slightly blurs sharpness at peak beats. Tightening a few over-explained thematic lines would improve momentum and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and often striking in image (“breathing becomes the only metronome counting what's left”). Repetitions of key phrases function as intentional motifs rather than lazy loops, and there are few to no syntactic artifacts or muddles. The main limitation is a touch of purple and thematic overstatement in the closing paragraphs, where figurative weight occasionally competes with immediacy. Still, line-level craft is solidly publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with a good balance between action and description, and few outright redundancies. Some lines tend toward mild purple or overstatement (“burned brighter than the enchanted lamps,” “making the very stones vibrate with anticipation”), but they do not significantly obscure meaning or momentum. Sentence structures vary enough to avoid monotony, and syntax remains clear through the climax. Trimming a few intensifiers and repeated constructions would sharpen the effect without major restructuring.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally graceful and controlled, with strong information density—images often carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the garden’s Victorian engineering echoing Eleanor’s backward-looking innovation). There are minor rough edges (a stray lowercase “suddenly,” slight repetition of key phrases like “turning mistakes into constellations”) and occasional near-glosses that could be tightened. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to obscure sense, and sentence rhythm avoids obvious scaffolding. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only light polishing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a pleasing rhythm and some effective images (the grotto as a sleeping serpent, sea glass as a gift from the depths). Most sentences carry at least two jobs—worldbuilding plus emotion or theme—so information density is decent. There is some mild purple-prose tendency and conceptual redundancy (“pearl of stillness,” “zephyr bloom,” repeated invocations of patience and gentleness) that could be pared back to sharpen impact. Still, nothing significantly obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with some striking images (“vines had woven through circuit boards in a way that seemed deliberate, almost reverent”) and efficient weaving of backstory into present perception. However, figurative density is high and occasionally tips toward purple or repetitive, and several abstract phrasings (“protected vulnerability as a catalyst for change,” “reclaimed integrity”) read more like thesis statements than lived sensation. There’s mild conceptual redundancy across adjacent sentences in the final third as the story reiterates transformation/healing. Despite these, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and often sonorous, with a clear attempt at lyricism. However, the prose is heavily overwritten: abstractions and similar metaphors recur without adding new layers, creating a sense of redundancy rather than intensification. Many lines tell us the same idea in slightly different phrasing (e.g., variations on collecting hopes, mist swirling, solemnizing the pages), which slows momentum. The density of figurative language flattens impact and would need trimming and sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with sentences that flow well aloud and vary in rhythm. Recurrent phrases and images (“verdant arbor,” “harvest moon,” “gathering hush”) are mostly intentional motifs rather than true loops, though a few lines verge on restating prior content in slightly different words. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, maintaining clarity in key beats like the activation of the device and the communal remembering. The line-level work is strong and readable, if not yet razor-sharp or strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often evocative, with strong images like bark peeling in “delicate scrolls” and berries “frost-encased.” Some lines lapse into cliché or redundancy (“pregnant with possibility,” “the world held its breath,” “banished the shadows”), and there’s occasional conceptual repetition about stillness, patience, and the coming darkness. The density of modifiers approaches purple in places but does not seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Line-level tightening—especially trimming repeated sentiments—would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong information density—lines tend to carry character, world, and theme simultaneously. Some phrases (“wounded season,” “cellar of reason,” “harvesting echoes”) are repeated or verge on decorative abstraction, bordering on purple in aggregate. Still, syntax is clear, grammar clean, and momentum generally preserved despite the lyric tilt. Trimming a few near-duplicate conceptual statements would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong image density, controlled rhythm, and minimal scaffolding; nearly every line is doing atmospheric and conceptual work. Metaphors (geological strata of hush, calcification of burdens) are coherent and sustained rather than mixed. There is some repetition of concepts and phrases, but it serves pattern and cadence more than padding. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece, and the final sentences land with clarity rather than blur.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme) and the rhythm generally supports the meditative pressure. There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (“crystallized time,” “harvest lessons from loss,” “rust-hued peace”) that edges toward over-articulation of theme. A small glitch (“指纹”) breaks the otherwise polished surface and betrays a mechanical seam. The prose is nonetheless vivid and largely economical, but these minor artifacts and occasional abstraction keep it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and mostly efficient given its lyrical ambitions; many sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) without obvious redundancy. There is some overloading of adjectives and metaphor (“profound fractured stillness,” “liquid peace,” “eroded ambitions”) that risks slight saturation but doesn’t seriously obscure meaning. Line-level clarity and grammar are clean, and the final beats land with a strong, coherent image. Trimming a few abstracted or near-synonymous phrases could sharpen momentum and allow the strongest images to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean and readable with smooth syntax and a few nicely turned images (lights “like stars awakening in an evening sky”). There is some conceptual redundancy and mild purple tilt—repeated phrases (“maze of intentions,” “equations for hope,” “stoic wonder”) and abstract summarizing where a concrete beat could do more work. Line-level momentum holds, but the language sometimes tells emotional and thematic states instead of embodying them in fresh sensory or behavioral detail. No major artifacts or confusions, but it doesn’t yet exhibit elite density or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory density and a clear rhythmic ear. However, it tends toward purple repetition—key phrases (“excruciatingly gentle,” “crystal whispering forecourt after rain,” “glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia”) recur without always adding new facets. Several late sentences paraphrase the transformation already dramatized, slightly dulling the impact and momentum of the ending. Despite these issues, clarity remains high and there are no major syntactic or logical stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong, concrete images like “dust motes dancing in the last rays of sunlight.” Most lines carry both atmospheric and thematic weight, and there are few outright redundancies. That said, there is some conceptual repetition (“architecture of lies,” “salvaging truth,” similar formulations of her mission) and occasional over-explanation of metaphors that could be pared back for greater impact. The final third edges toward abstract summary rather than letting images do the heaviest work.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a mostly smooth rhythm and some effective images (“voice rough as driftwood,” “snow…muffle the world further”). There is mild redundancy in phrasing and concept (patience, hush, observation reiterated), and some lines restate what’s already clear in slightly different words. Figurative language is controlled and rarely overwrought, but the line-level work seldom surprises or compresses multiple layers of meaning into a single sentence. Overall it’s solid, publishable-quality prose, but not yet line-by-line arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and high-density, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“thicker than the finest spider silk yet more fragile than spun sugar when held against the weight of memory”). Rhythm varies and there is little true scaffolding or redundancy. Some figurative language and thematic terminology recur in ways that occasionally feel a shade purple or abstract (“healing geography of human hearts,” “projection of presence”), softening impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum through the lyric arc remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, strong sensory images, and efficient paragraphing that tracks the emotional and causal beats. Figurative language (stone teeth, palace dreaming of flight) is apt and not overstacked. There is mild redundancy in emphasizing hypothesizing and mechanical vs. organic beauty, and a few abstractions where more concrete embodiment could heighten impact. Nonetheless, rhythm and clarity hold throughout, and no significant artifacts blunt the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, strong noun/verb choices, and good integration of physical action with reflection. The piece sustains a lyrical register without major grammatical slips or genuine purple incoherence. However, there are paraphrase loops and motif reiterations that add minimal new information (“scars can sing” and repeated lagoon/cloud mirroring), slightly dulling momentum. The prose is polished enough for many venues but would benefit from tightening and more varied figurative strategy to reach elite-level sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and efficient, flowing sentences that maintain momentum; almost every line contributes to image or mood. Some phrases are awkward or slightly off-register (“to unstick the box,” “realistically imaginative nature”), and figurative density occasionally borders on purple, stacking abstractions rather than sharpening specifics. Recurrent terms like “defiant hush” and “sidereal patience” edge toward overuse but still function thematically. Overall, line-level craft is above average and publishable with a light tightening pass for precision and variety.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some striking images (“reality bent and flowed like liquid light”) and a consistent rhythm. Yet it leans toward repetition and purple abstraction—stock cosmic diction and the frequent reuse of key phrases erode momentum. Many sentences restate similar ideas about infinity, cycles, and light without adding new pressure or specificity. The overall effect is pleasant but somewhat over-smooth, with limited variation in texture or intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level writing is generally clean, with solid rhythm and few outright redundancies or confusions. There are occasional familiar phrases (“weight of each life,” “empty and overflowing”) and a mild tendency toward abstracted, theme-driven sentences in the latter half. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple or muddled, and causality remains clear. Tightening a few echoing concepts and clichés would elevate already-competent prose to a more exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with effective recurring images (pendulum, obsidian, carvings) and a strong sense of control. However, there is a tendency toward abstraction and repetition of key terms (“shared balance,” “incremental absolution,” “restoration”) that can feel like thematic scaffolding rather than compressed, fresh image-work. Some lines edge into purple or expository (“a tangible peace born of collective responsibility”) instead of letting concrete action imply meaning. Momentum remains acceptable, but tighter, more image-driven sentences would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is smooth, largely free of scaffolding, and often does multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, tone, and character) with a single sentence. Some phrases and constructions repeat (“velveteen gloom,” reiterated explanations of intentions and echoes), edging toward mild redundancy and a touch of purple. Figurative language is mostly coherent and apt; it rarely muddies sense or causality. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, though a tightening pass could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally clear, with a few strong images (the spire as “dark tooth,” the quill illuminating the page). However, line-level repetition (“predictive modeling,” “groundedly imaginative,” “seeded innovation within a constraint”) and conceptual restatement flatten momentum. Many sentences explain or rephrase her role and purpose rather than advancing pressure or image, giving a slightly essayistic feel. Still, there is no true purple prose or figurative muddle, and the closure image lands intelligibly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and readable, with good syntactic variety and few true redundancies. Some phrases verge on purple or recursive (“story famine” and dust mechanics get re-explained), but not enough to obscure sense or stall the piece. Expository blocks about the famine and dust technology are clear, though they carry more explanation than compression in spots. Overall line-level craft is solid and publishable but not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, syntactically varied, and mostly economical, with several strong images (ash disintegrating, dust in cracks, light catching shards). There is some conceptual repetition (“mirage of safety,” “weaving truth carefully,” restating how her work functions) that could be trimmed without loss. Overall momentum holds for a lyric piece, and no major figurative muddle or scaffolding undermines the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and occasionally striking (“chronometer of human knowledge continued its silent turning”), with solid rhythm. There is noticeable repetition of key phrases (“sedimentary layers,” “rationally rebellious,” “competing narratives,” “ancient methods”) that reads like scaffold and dilutes impact. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (Milo’s motive, society’s rejection of the past), producing a mild sense of loop and drag. Line-level craft is competent but not yet honed to the density and precision a top-tier venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and flow smoothly, with no major clarity issues or tangled metaphors. There is noticeable repetition of certain phrases (“expectantly resigned,” “velvet library,” “denote”) and conceptual restatement that could be tightened for higher information density. Prose leans into abstract nouns and thematic explanation over concrete, lived-in images and specific physical or emotional textures. It’s solid journeyman-level writing but lacks the compression and precision expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with some effective images (“jasmine and rust,” “dust motes dancing in the air”). There is noticeable repetition of ideas and phrasing (decay/ruins, gentle rebellion, synaptic plasticity) without each recurrence adding new pressure or nuance. Several lines feel like slogan-level aphorisms rather than fresh, scene-rooted observations, and the scientific explanation of his ability reads as flat exposition. Overall, the line work is solid but could be tightened and made more surprising to meet a top-tier bar.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with a few appealing phrases (“nectar dusk,” “where static dances and whispers fade”). Sentences vary enough in length and rhythm to avoid monotony, and information is generally delivered with efficiency. There is some reliance on abstract phrasing and light repetition (e.g., restating Elara’s motivation and honesty) and occasional mildly purple turns, but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. The line-level craft is solid and publication-ready but does not yet show the compression and multi-layered density of the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and image-rich, with good control of rhythm and a consistent lexical field around silence, light, and residue. Information density is decent—most sentences are doing at least two jobs—and there are few outright redundancies. That said, certain formulations (“inadvertently profound,” “sanctify her understanding,” “creeping normalities”) stack abstractions and verge on purple, and reiterations of the thesis in similar language create a mild sense of looped emphasis. Line-level craft is solidly above average but could be tightened for concision and sharper image-to-abstraction ratios.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, varied, and clear, with strong images (“bioluminescent corals,” “silt that had preserved the city garden”) and a smooth reading rhythm. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose tendency, especially where philosophical exposition stacks metaphors and abstractions, but it rarely muddies meaning. Most lines pull double duty for mood and information, though a tighter cut on repeated thematic phrasing would improve propulsion. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with modest trimming rather than deep revision.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clear and mechanically clean, and the narrative moves forward without major stalls or confusion. There is mild repetition and abstraction (“texture of his missed opportunity,” “perpetual motion,” “balancedly daring” recur in similar formulations) that could be tightened, and a few lines drift toward rhetorical summary rather than fresh image. The prose is serviceable-to-good rather than striking: it maintains momentum but rarely surprises at the line level. No serious artifacts or muddled metaphors impair closure, but it doesn’t yet reach the density and precision of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level writing is generally clean, with strong sensory detail and few syntactic or clarity issues. Some sentences lean abstract (“universal truths about human connection,” “tapestry of linguistic connection”) and occasionally repeat similar concepts, edging toward mild redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure meaning. Trimming a few near-duplicate thematic lines would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sensory specificity, metaphor, and action often do multiple jobs at once. There is some stacking of imagery (“whispers clinging… like moss,” “rosewater dread,” etc.) that verges on overwriting but does not obscure meaning. Sentences mostly maintain momentum and clarity, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. The closing paragraph lands cleanly, though a touch of adjective density prevents a cleaner, sharper cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally concise, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (advancing action while sustaining mood or theme). Some repetition and mild purple (“latent radiance,” “the very fabric of possibility and certainty”) verge on abstraction, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or causality. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about defiance and impossibility, indicating light scaffold that could be tightened. Overall line-level craft is solid and publishable with revision, but not yet at the razor-honed level of elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically varied enough to carry the scene without confusion. Some images are effective, but others veer into repetition and abstraction (“repulsive allure,” “pure potential,” “strange new existence”) that dilute impact. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same emotional realization, particularly near the end, creating a mild sense of redundancy and slowing momentum. The line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed, with room to cut and sharpen for higher-density impact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with few if any grammatical or syntactic missteps. Some phrases verge on purple or repetitive (“turning each obstacle into an instrument,” “sketched resonance”) and a handful of sentences could be tightened to avoid conceptual redundancy. Nonetheless, line-level clarity and momentum are maintained, and most images pull their weight. There are no serious artifacts or figurative muddles that obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with some effective images (“sunwashed sky,” “dread… in his bones like the salt air”). Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and most lines carry clear informational and atmospheric weight. The main weakness is a tendency toward summary and abstract phrasing (e.g., the exposition-heavy paragraph explaining the evil and the watchers’ role) where more scene-level specificity could heighten impact. There are no major loops or purple stacks, but the language stays in a safe, workmanlike register rather than reaching exceptional density or music.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and smoothly readable, with a good balance between description and summary. There are some repetitive constructions and abstract formulations that could be sharpened, but no major loops or purple-prose tangles. Sentences often do double duty (setting + theme), and momentum is preserved despite the expository tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with several strong images (pillars as “silent sentinels,” the “satisfying click” of the inkwell). A few phrases drift toward purple or repeat conceptually (“interlaced absence,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “hushed blaze”), and there is occasional redundancy in summarizing his calling. Nonetheless, line-level writing remains legible and purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character rather than collapsing into ornament. Trimming a bit of abstraction and tightening some long sentences would bring it closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatical, clear, and flows smoothly, with a steady rhythm appropriate to a meditative piece. There is some redundancy and near-paraphrase (“The blackout had ended, but a new illumination had begun”; repeated mentions of reclaimed stillness, dappled light, tranquil perception) that could be tightened. Figurative language is mostly safe but sometimes drifts toward purple or abstract, especially in the closing moral statements. Line-level craft is solid but not yet lean or surprising enough for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong images (glass basilica “descending while ascending,” gems casting “dancing shadows”) and few outright clunkers. There’s some repetition of ideas (“his motivation was singular,” “obsession and solace”) and an occasional tendency toward purple or telling abstraction rather than letting images do the work. Sentence variety and momentum are solid, and the final paragraphs land clearly. Line-level craft is strong but not yet ruthlessly compressed or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and most sentences carry at least one unit of information or mood. However, there’s noticeable redundancy and phrase looping (e.g., repeated explanations of the crystal’s nature and “unused potential pools”), and some lines veer into mildly purple territory without adding precision. Abstractions and labels (“strange cocktail of grief and purpose,” “new kind of power”) often sit where sharper images or actions could stand, softening momentum. Line-level craft is solidly functional but not yet compressed or surprising enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and moves forward at a reasonable pace, with many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and information. However, there is consistent overwriting and abstraction—phrases like “brilliant dimness that defied all logical explanation,” “liquid night,” and multiple “as if” constructions stack figurative language without always sharpening meaning. Some paraphrase/idea repetition (e.g., reiterating the observatory as decoder, Maya’s surprise, belonging as frequency) reduces information density. The line-level craft is solid but not lean or surprising enough yet for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and largely precise, with several strong images (the carvings “arranged over time like pieces of a grand puzzle,” the paired watch hands in the sand). Information density is good, with most sentences carrying both emotional and narrative weight. Nonetheless, there is some repetition of concepts (“weight,” “sieved hush,” “manufactured memories,” “tempered regret”) and a tilt toward abstract phrasing and summary that slightly slows momentum and edges toward purple in places. Trimming a few near-duplicate emotional formulations would sharpen the lines without losing the lyric quality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some evocative phrases (“mist swirled like forgotten ghosts,” “furrowed hush of the parapet”) and solid rhythm. There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (neutral territory, recycling mistakes into wisdom, untethering) that edges toward thematic and lexical redundancy. Sentences mostly do more than one job, and there’s little obvious padding or syntactic clutter. Line-level craft is solid but could benefit from sharper cuts and more varied, concrete embodiment of emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and economical; most sentences do at least two jobs (character + setting or theme). There is some reliance on familiar metaphors and stock formulations (“cloak of her regrets,” “houses of cards,” “anchor and albatross”), and occasional redundancy of idea, which slightly dulls the sharpness of otherwise competent lines. Momentum is preserved well for a contemplative piece; reflection rarely feels like padding. Line-level craft is solid but does not yet display the compression or surprise expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and readable, with some effective images (the lake as “shattered mirrors”). At the same time, metaphor density is high and often repetitive, with phrases and concepts resurfacing (“labyrinth of choices,” “delicately robust”) in ways that feel more like reuse than deepening. Several sentences do similar conceptual work back-to-back, creating mild redundancy and a slightly purple sheen. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum, but line-level tightening would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that advance atmosphere and emotion together. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and there are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding lines; rhythm reads well aloud. Some metaphors and modifiers (“cosmic intimacy,” “moon-kissed trees”) tread close to poetic cliché or purple if judged at a top-market standard, slightly dulling impact. Tightening a handful of stacked descriptors would heighten propulsion and sharpen key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and free from grammatical noise, with several striking images and a good sense of cadence. There is some repetition of key phrases (“choking beauty,” “willingly perplexed”) and thematic statements that could be pared back for greater impact and density. A few sentences lean toward abstract explanation rather than concrete image, particularly in the back half where the story summarizes what “cloudbound repentance” taught her. Nonetheless, line-level control remains solid, and no major artifacts or muddled metaphors impede clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information (“its corridors echoing with ghosts of a million dead souls”). There is some density of figurative language and conceptual phrasing that could be pared back for sharpness, and a few echoing constructions verge on purple rather than precise. Momentum holds despite reflective passages, but a slightly tighter line-edit could reduce repetition and heighten impact in the central ritual section. No major artifacts or confusions impede clarity, especially at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is grammatical, mostly clear, and occasionally striking, and the rhythm is generally smooth with few outright clunkers. Nonetheless, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts, and some lines drift into purple or abstract territory that restates what the reader already knows. Figurative language clusters around a few repeated images rather than opening new angles, which dulls their impact. Overall, the line-level work is competent and occasionally vivid, but not as compressed or surprising as top-tier literary venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with few outright artifacts or confusions. There is some repetition of favored phrases and metaphors (“cradle of sparks,” “winking hush,” “luminous”), and an inclination toward abstraction (“what the ruling order had long sought to extinguish,” “artistic deception”) over sharply concrete moments. Still, most sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and action—and momentum is not unduly stalled. Line-level craft is above average but not yet sharpened to the precision and freshness expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, no major grammatical issues, and steady momentum through the ritual. Some phrases and structures repeat (“lingering promise,” “frictionless reality,” similar sentence cadences), and there are moments of mild purple prose and abstraction. The prose rarely muddies meaning but doesn’t always maximize compression or specificity; several sentences could do more than one job. Overall it’s solid and readable, but not yet at the razor-honed level top venues expect.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with smooth syntax, clarity, and some striking phrases (“clouds that gathered like suppressed words,” “storm-kissed wonder”). However, the density of metaphor is high and occasionally repetitive (storm/atmosphere/truth/words mapped across multiple similar sentences), edging toward purple and slightly dulling impact over the span of the piece. Several sentences do similar conceptual work (“cartography of scars,” “mapping wounds,” “verses as rarefied air”), creating mild paraphrase loops. This remains publishable-level prose with some tightening, but the over-insistence of imagery keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is fluent and generally well-paced, with clear sentences and a good blend of action and description. Some lines edge toward purple or redundant (“prismatic chaos,” “dignified chaos,” repeated formulations around questions and destinations), but they don’t seriously obstruct clarity. Information density is solid, though a few sentences restate similar ideas about his reputation and method. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, even if the line-level never quite feels risky or razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences advance image, concept, or character. Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically aligned, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. That said, figurative language and abstract coinages are very frequent, creating a slightly purple, same-texture feel across the whole piece. The lack of plainer, concrete counterpoints occasionally dulls impact and momentum rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and efficient, with images like “boughs of the great tidal arbor that swayed gently in the atmospheric currents” doing multiple jobs at once. There is some repetition and mild overstatement (“defying the logic of time itself”; repeating “surprise fate with an unplanned encore”), but it does not meaningfully obscure sense or momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and anchored. Line-level craft is solidly publishable though still shy of the precision and compression of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with varied sentence structures and generally good momentum. Individual lines often do double duty, advancing both scene and atmosphere, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. At the same time, the language sometimes slips into stock lyricism and mild purple prose (“dissolving like mist at dawn,” “luminous warmth that chased away the shadows of doubt”), which blunts distinctiveness and edge. These tendencies don’t obscure clarity or closure but keep the line-level craft below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally graceful and image-rich, with strong sensory detail and recurring motifs that earn some of their repetition. However, line-level density is high—many sentences carry stacked modifiers and abstractions (“rhythmically placid waves,” “cerulean regret,” “transcendent beauty”) that occasionally edge into purple and slow momentum. Certain phrases and concepts recur in similar form (“tides of remembrance,” “after the severance”) without always adding new pressure, creating a mild sense of loop. The writing is polished and clear, but a sharper edit could trim redundancy and let a few central images carry more of the weight.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("accumulated dust patterns," "kindled humility," "needless drama") within a short space. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns creates a flat, rhythmic monotony that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-heavy exposition and repetitive sentence structures ("She had been," "She had placed"). A grammatical error ("force of physical blow" missing an article) and the reliance on summary sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("capsize survivor" x4, "unshaken marvels" x4, "silently expressive" x3) creates a robotic, keyword-stuffed cadence. The prose relies on abstract descriptors instead of concrete, sensory-grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from adverbial telling ("inadvertently stubborn," "surprisingly light") and abstract similes ("fish scattered like silver thoughts") that obscure rather than illuminate. The reliance on summary phrasing ("Working methodically," "navigated through") prevents the generation of scene-level momentum or density.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by mechanical repetition of full phrases ("antique silver bell" x4, "terra-cotta arbor" x3, "intergenerational support" x2) within a short space. This creates a stilted rhythm. The reliance on abstract summary ("military precision," "gentle persistence") rather than concrete verb-driven action weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "felt") and expository shorthand ("Elara's motivation was clear"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience. Key visual moments, such as the appearance of past-life faces, are summarized rather than described with specific sensory detail. Cliché phrasing ("tears welled," "purple waterfalls") and poetic fallacies ("The air breathed") further weaken the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" and abstract nouns ("properties," "logic," "substance"), and the required phrases ("retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie") are inserted as awkward, rhythm-breaking labels. Frequent filter verbs and adverbs ("immediately," "meticulously") dilute the narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by repetitive phrasing (the specific tone prompt "staggering grace" appears twice verbatim) and expository telling. The ending devolves into a summarized timeline that kills scene momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose leans toward purple abstraction ("musical in its devastation") and clichés ("snow on a battlefield") instead of concrete sensory details. The writing tells the reader the sound is powerful rather than evoking that power through fresh language.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing ("captured moonbeams" appears five times) and abstract descriptions. "Luminous disbelief" is used as a noun phrase in both the opening and closing, which feels like a forced insertion rather than organic vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and heavy metaphor density ("trembled against," "surrendering to," "breathing life"). The specific phrase "during ice melting" is inserted twice in a grammatically awkward manner that disrupts syntax and reads as a forced prompt inclusion. Labeling the character "thoughtfully spirited" is a tell that weakens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("heart pounding," "steely gaze") and adjective stacking ("shadowy dangerous organization"). Sentences are often scaffolded to deliver exposition ("The acclaimed stunt double... harbored secret phobias"), stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive looping artifacts; the phrases "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" appear eight times, and "flaking gold leaf booklet" is repeated in full three times. This redundancy creates a drumming scaffold that obscures the otherwise competent sentence-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive filter verbs ("Unit 347 realized," "understood," "saw"), creating a barrier between reader and action. Sentence structures are often passive or descriptive ("was designed," "seemed to resonate"), slowing momentum. The "remarkably composed" phrase and similar descriptors appear as telling-labels rather than demonstrated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and telling ("desire," "betrayal," "hope") rather than concrete imagery or action. There is a lack of sensory density, and the sentence structure often repeats a pattern of exposition followed by abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on clichés ("gnarled hands," "pure hearts," "deceit in their souls") and abstract nouns ("transformation," "mysteries"). The tendency to explain the meaning of symbols ("turning flaws into features") dilutes the literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe text artifacts are present; specific prompt phrases (e.g., "mechanically warm," "subdued awakenings") are repeated verbatim multiple times (3-4x each), causing significant drag. This repetition flags a failure to integrate language organically.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.4)
    Suffers from the non-English text artifact and significant redundancy ("silence that hung amid the hush"). The prose relies on clichés ("fateful night," "shimmering stars," "pearls in the deep") and abstract summary rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, propelling the narrative well. A few metaphorical constructions (truths falling as condensation, tears accumulating in the earth) border on purple density but generally fit the established atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant repetitive artifacting; the phrases "swallowed truth" (4x) and "drowsy alertness" (3x) create a jarring loop. The prose leans on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("oppressive darkness," "frantic calls") rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery ("fractured through cascading murk"), though the verbatim repetition of phrases ("untold seasons," "crumbling peace") within a short word count dulls the prose's freshness slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("symphony of healing," "stormy seas of trauma," "troubled hearts") and abstract emotional labeling ("Maya experienced cautious exuberance"). These artifacts obscure the concrete reality of the scene and weaken the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts collapse the prose quality. The phrase "bronze quiet" appears seven times, "sensitively perceptive" three times, and "displaced axis" five times in a short space, creating a jarring, template-like cadence. This "keyword stuffing" prevents any rhythmic flow or density.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("hidden in plain sight" appears twice, "ripples... waves," "seed planted," "subtle magic"). Abstract nouns and passive constructions dominate, resulting in low information density and a lack of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.0)
    Required phrases ("unraveled stillness," "decorated with silence") are repeated verbatim, creating drag. The prose leans on clichés like "plumb the depths" and "physical weight," and the sentence rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition of full phrases ("nautilus shell segment" x4, "frozen lake" x5, "chronologically homesick" x3) creates a robotic, checklist cadence that stalls momentum. These text artifacts expose the scaffolding and prevent immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by telling ("The darkening brightness matched his emotional state") and abstract phrasing ("periodically eternal"). The mix of mystic imagery with technical terms like "algorithmically formed" creates a jarring register clash that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.3)
    Significant artifact penalties apply for the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("filament of hush" x3, "audibly muted" x2, "mirrored hush" x2, "turning seasons" x2). The prose relies on abstract nouns and passive constructions, lacking the concrete density and propulsion required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose quality suffers critically from repetitive artifacts. The prompt phrases "progressing laterally," "layered tranquility," and "nurture integrity in solitude" are each repeated 2–3 times in a short text, creating a jarring, looped effect. These insertions result in awkward syntax (e.g., "progressing laterally through his investigations") that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by stock phrasing ("weathered hands," "tears welled," "heart both lighter and heavier") and high filter-verb density. The reliance on emotive telling reduces density and immediacy, particularly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose; "passionate subtlety" and "ethically playful" each appear twice as forced modifiers, and "impossible choices" is repeated. The density of adjectives and "tell-heavy" phrasing ("words attempting to capture...") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés and mixed metaphors ("bones of the land," "symphony of survival," "tapestry of sound," "seeds of a new beginning"). These abstract phrases replace concrete action and dilute the impact of the unique setting imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is grammatically competent but heavy on scaffolding and filter verbs ("Elias could sense," "watched," "sought"). Conceptual looping—restating the nature of the work—stalls momentum and reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (the specific phrase "whimsically attentive" appears twice) and adjective clutter ("gentle sea breeze," "dim evening light"). The reliance on abstract labels ("exuberant compassion") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is burdened by excessive adjectives and abstract metaphors that stall momentum ("restless, aching glow," "spindly, transparent trees"). Phrasing is often awkward or forced ("boldly sympathetic regard") to accommodate prompt words, resulting in a lack of sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from "telling" ("defied natural physics") and reliance on clichés ("shattered into a million fragments," "distant thunder"). Adverbs like "unnaturally" and "cautiously" clutter sentences and dilute the impact of the verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prompt elements are integrated with jarring clumsiness ("known... as being gently inventive," "ever since the ambiguous loss"), disrupting the line-level flow. The prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("murmuring equations that described sorrow") and redundancy that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose relies heavily on adverbs ("instantly," "kindly," "methodically") and clichés ("delicate as a butterfly wing," "flood of sense memory"). The prompt phrases "kindly methodical" and "sapphire hush" are repeated verbatim as static labels rather than integrated into the flow, creating a scaffolded, repetitive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on filtering and summary ("Weeks passed in a blur"), distancing the reader from the action. Clunky phrasing ("circuitously sincere," "circuits of communication") and label-heavy descriptions ("reluctant metamorphosis") weaken the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density ("labyrinthine corridors," "fragmented memories") and relies on summary ("Lena had become an expert") instead of immediate action. The writing tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prompt phrases ("steadily unpredictable," "everyday magic") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting rhythm. Adverb-heavy construction ("completely off guard," "suddenly became") and tell-heavy prose dilute the scene's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and adjective stacking ("pristine but painful emptiness"). Prompt phrases ("reactively visionary," "staggered intervals") are inserted as clumsy expository labels that disrupt natural syntax and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and mixed metaphors ("geometric symphonies," "dissonant harmony"). Key phrases like "analytically artistic" and "hour that divides..." are repeated clumsily. The density of abstract nouns obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is cluttered with repetitive phrases ("magic square tile," "forgotten patterns," "unheard symphony") and abstract concepts. "Courageously kind" is an awkward, label-heavy construction used repetitively. The reliance on passive summary drains all momentum from the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("delicate balance," "methodical precision," "unprecedented... resonance") and relies heavily on "to be" verbs and abstract nouns. There is a high density of telling over showing, with key emotional shifts described in summary ("boredom evaporated") rather than demonstrated through action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and functional, but the repetition of prompt phrases ("liquefy rigid thinking"/"liquefying her fear" and "deathly vitality" twice) creates a slightly mechanical feel. The visual descriptions of the ink patterns border on generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is mechanically competent but heavy with "telling" abstractions ("singular and pure," "incandescent restraint") and adverbial modification. These artifacts slow momentum and dilute the immediacy of the dawn moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dominated by abstract nouns ("humanity," "existence," "truth") and summary "telling," lacking high-density concrete imagery. The reliance on metaphors like "tapestry of human existence" obscures specific reality rather than illuminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=2.5)
    Significant proofreading errors ("began to reimagining," "Evelyncompleted") and awkward phrasings ("reimagining past conversations") disqualify the piece from professional publication. The prose leans heavily on purple descriptors and repetitive labeling that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.0)
    Contains conspicuous errors, including a typo ("blossomig") and a grammatical stumble ("culture need not absorb shocks anymore"). The prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("intoxicating atmosphere," "chaotic") rather than concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of multi-word noun phrases ("nightwatch's hourglass sand grain," "dawning hush," "moonlit summit" each appear ~4 times), creating a drumbeat of artifacts. The sentence structure is functional but lacks variation, often relying on simple declarative patterns that reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is functional but laden with adverbs ("tirelessly," "wryly," "softly") and abstract labels ("heartfelt," "uncanny ability"). There is a reliance on telling competence ("surgical precision") rather than showing the tactile reality of the work, resulting in a muted, slightly purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by adjective-noun clichés ("practiced precision," "methodical grace," "scholarly heart") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on labels to convey atmosphere ("worrying tranquility") instead of sensory detail weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetitive phrasing drags the score down; "wild hush" appears five times, acting as a scaffold artifact rather than a motif. The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("cryptic bell tuner," "ancient archway," "skeletal buildings"), creating a monotonous rhythm and density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant adverbial clutter ("violently," "carefully," "insistently," "rapidly") that drags on momentum. Repetitive phrasing ("crushing finality" and "grinding finality" in close proximity; "lonesome splendor" repeated verbatim) and stock metaphors degrade the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.2)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting, including extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence runs that persist from the first paragraph to the last. Key phrases are repeated three to four times in identical contexts, creating a mechanical drumbeat that obscures meaning. The prose lacks propulsion, functioning instead as a static scaffolding for the required elements.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive artifact insertion ("lovingly venomous" appears twice) and logical oxymorons ("clutched... in nonexistent hands"). The backstory logic regarding who saved whom is syntactically confused, breaking the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("fingers danced," "sleeping serpents") and precious phrasing ("poetic wharf weaver"). Key prompt phrases ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") are repeated verbatim, creating a "check-the-box" feel. The reliance on summary sentences ("As days passed...") drains momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is competent but saturated with telling ("cautious enchantment," "reverent way") and abstract phrasing ("absorbing the history"). Reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("eerie harmony," "grotesque yet beautiful") replaces fresh, concrete observation with standard literary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but heavily reliant on stock phrasing ("old friend who knew all her secrets," "seamlessly wove together threads") and abstract nouns. Rhythmic variety is dampened by a tendency to explain the significance of every action immediately after it occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing, with "adjacent possibilities" appearing three times and "echoed silence" used as identical bookends in a short space. Adjective-noun pairings are frequent and sometimes overwrought ("prismatic tears," "crimson leaves"), reducing narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive loops, with the phrase "fierce tenderness" appearing four times and "singing spirits" six times in a short text. This mechanical repetition destroys immersion and reads like a glitch or unedited draft. The writing relies on clichés ("healing power," "magic," "otherworldly glow") and telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.0)
    Significant repetition artifacts damage the prose (the prompt word "unknot" appears four times; "shrewdly innocent" twice). Metaphor density is high and occasionally mixed, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is cluttered with meta-commentary artifacts ("fulfilled her motivation") and awkward phrasing ("knowledge network of connections") that expose the scaffolding. Frequent use of clichés and abstract summaries drains the text of immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant scaffold artifacts are present; the numbered "awakenings" create a repetitive, list-like cadence that stalls momentum. The prose relies on clichés ("dancing playfully," "perfect harmony") and abstract nouns that distance the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is competent but heavy with exposition and "telling." A distinct repetition artifact occurs with the phrase "converging chaos of their," which appears verbatim in paragraphs 10 and 13, reading as a loop rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and overwriting ("shyly unstoppable" used twice, the full "lullabies" phrase used twice, "photosynthesize pain" used twice). The density of adjectives and abstract nouns ("resplendent beauty," "quiet intelligence") slows momentum. The reliance on summary tells rather than active showing creates a passive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant fluency issues disrupt the prose, notably the adverb collision "moved gently systematically" and the awkward syntax in "emotions humanity had once known but disappeared." Repetitive phrasing ("museum of extinct feelings" appears twice in close proximity) and purple descriptors ("foxglove regret") lower the quality.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("symphonies of truth" x5, "interconnected promises" x5, "glass ink well" x5, "cautious exuberance" x3) creates a distracting artifact loop. This keyword stuffing disrupts flow and replaces genuine description with stock labels. The prose lacks lexical variety and density, reading more like a checklist than a narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe text artifacts present: "Antique surveyor's chain" is repeated verbatim five times; "dappled resolve" is used three times in nonsensical contexts. These repetitions fracture the prose rhythm and obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from "purple" artifacts and heavy adjective-noun pairing ("cosmic dust of her yesterdays," "stubborn dust motes," "ancient vibrations"). Metaphors often clutter the sentence logic rather than clarifying the image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetitive phrasing ("featherly determination" and "fractured hush" both appear twice as fixed labels) and clunky noun stacks ("pilot logbook weather code") drag on the rhythm. The prose relies on simile-heavy, purple descriptions ("air thickening... like water," "tears... like prisms") that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.9)
    Egregious repetition of prompt phrases constitutes a major text artifact; "softly ingenious" appears four times and "shadowseam wonder" twice, creating a mechanical, template-like cadence. Clichés like "tears welled" and "changed forever" weaken the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose is functional, it suffers from the repetitive overuse of key phrases ("cheerful gloom," "before memory fades," "transliterate") that feel like forced refrain insertions rather than organic rhythmic choices. This repetition creates a mechanical texture that draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("tears in her eyes," "winking stars") and abstract descriptions ("micro-expressions of surprise delight") that distance the reader. Sentence structures are often static or repetitive, and the reliance on telling over showing blunts the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction ("obsidian grace," "cosmic truth," "divine inscription") that obscures concrete action. The phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is a jarring noun cluster that creates a semantic stumble, and sentence structures become repetitive in the explanatory phase of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose relies on clichés ("rose before the sun," "practiced grace") and abstract nouns ("profound complexity," "sacred resolve") that obscure specific meaning. Filter verbs ("sensed," "understood," "saw") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The phrase "inexplicable force" acts as a scaffold to move the plot, highlighting a lack of causal connective tissue.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with "text artifacts" including stock metaphors ("scars were merely maps"), oxymorons ("hard softness"), and therapy-speak ("validate vulnerability"). Sentence structures are repetitive and heavy, often following a template pattern that creates a sluggish rhythm. Over-reliance on filter verbs ("He realized," "He allowed") dilutes the immediacy of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("Elian realized," "He felt") and clichés ("spinning like a dervish," "tremulously"). The reliance on abstract nouns ("intentional interference," "anticipatory energy") weakens the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-noun pairings ("exuberant greenery," "subtle resonances") and "tell" phrases ("rich with information"). The integration of prompt phrases results in clunky syntax ("extracted the half-burned diaries found in a fireplace").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by awkward phrasing ("perceptively calm" suggests a diction error for "perceptibly"), exact repetition of the prompt phrase "dusky harmony," and abstract clichés ("patterns within patterns").

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("lines into their face," "fragile as terracotta," "impossible beauty") and abstract adjectives. The phrase "operatively gentle" is an awkward, non-idiomatic insertion that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically competent, but marred by melodramatic phrasing ("divided soul," "fractured grace") and heavy-handed modifiers. The reliance on explaining the emotional weight ("testament to his empire's success") dilutes the impact of the strong physical imagery available in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("between sigh and smile," "silver courtyard under snow," "prism sanctuary under starlight") which appear 3–4 times each in a short space. This creates a distractingly mechanical cadence that violates the rubric's loop/artifact screen. The text relies on abstract metaphors over concrete action, reducing clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts destroy flow: "half-lit epiphany" appears five times, "meteor hush" three times, and "uncommonly serene" three times. The prose is repetitive and relies on weak telling ("practiced movements," "unconventional workshop") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("interrupted cadence" x3, "blushing stillness" x2, "transiently rooted" x2) within a short space, creating a loop/artifact effect. Clichés like "living tapestry" and "divine chorus" reduce fresh impact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.1)
    Grammar and mechanics are functional, but the prose suffers from overwriting ("ethereal blues," "strange internal light," "living energy"). The repetition of the specific prompt phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") within a short space creates noticeable lexical artifacts that drag on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("dancing like tiny spirits," "turbulence in her mind") and adjective-adverb clutter. The specific phrase "precisely playful" appears twice as a jarring text artifact, and "ethereal grit" is a mixed descriptor that lowers clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.2)
    Line-level execution is severely compromised by the unintelligible "dato" error and the distracting repetition of specific phrases (e.g., "between regimes" appears three times). These artifacts, alongside the verbatim insertion of prompt requirements, disrupt the prose rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is marred by awkward constructions (e.g., "The box had the attribute that it reappears") and forced prompt integration ("His motivation to teach resentment... had been Elara's goal"). Purple prose artifacts like "metallic despair" and "starlight given solid form" obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the mechanical repetition of multi-word phrases ("firmly grounded," "ruined orchard district," "synchronized breathing," "runaway dream") which appear verbatim 2-3 times in a short space. The phrase "upon the shimmer of twilight frost" is inserted syntactically awkwardly ("crafted... upon the shimmer"). These artifacts break the narrative flow and read as checklist compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by "telling" artifacts and adverb-heavy descriptors. Phrases like "symbolic of bridging the gap" explain the subtext rather than letting the image speak, reducing density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe line-level failures include the "санузл" artifact and the scaffold loop ("bathrooms... in bathrooms" in the same sentence). The prose relies heavily on adjective stacking ("luminous leaves," "weary features") and tell-heavy exposition ("defied all logic," "simply complicated nature") rather than active description.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from telling over showing ("motivation intensified") and repetitive phrasing ("unheard symphony" appears three times). Key action beats, particularly the rescue, are summarized, robbing the story of narrative momentum at critical junctures.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive, mechanical insertion of required phrases ("blissfully aberrant" appears three times; "trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace" twice each), creating a stuttering, checklist-like rhythm. These repetitions act as text artifacts that break immersion, alongside frequent passive constructions that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose suffers from repetitive labelling (the phrase "warmly methodical" is repeated verbatim) and low information density. The text relies on "scaffold" sentences that explain what is happening ("Her motivation extended beyond...") instead of trusting the action. Adverb-heavy constructions ("carefully," "practiced") dull the immediacy of the physical work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "gentle luminosity" appears three times) and weak adjective-noun pairings ("utter stillness," "profound quiet"). The writing relies on "telling" summaries rather than high-density, active scene construction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mechanically sound, but suffers from some overwrought phrasing ("thistle-blown hope," "retrocognitively blessed mind") that feels like prompt-insertion. The prose leans heavily on adjectives and abstract nouns, reducing density and propulsion in the active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (the specific phrase "deepening hush" appears three times) and dense, sometimes clunky figurative language ("memories dripping like the rain"). These artifacts and the reliance on similes in place of concrete action create a drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    The phrase "fire spinner's kerosene rag knot" is repeated in full three times, creating a significant rhythmic scaffold artifact. The prose leans toward overwriting ("purple that sang," "green that whispered") and relies on label-heavy descriptions ("serious playfulness") rather than demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("tangential approach," "texture of time," "jade cicada," "difficult conversation") within a short space, creating a looping artifact. Abstract nouns clutter the sentences, and the sentence structures frequently recycle the "Maya [verb]" or "The [object] [verb]" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically competent, but relies occasionally on stock phrasing ("siren song," "psychological torture") that dulls the impact. While the descriptions of silence are fresh, some surrounding narration leans on generic descriptors ("bizarre celestial anomaly"). The sentence level craft is functional and clear but lacks the sharp economy of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling and emotive labeling ("inexplicable comfort," "satisfaction deeper than words," "pure potential") instead of concrete showing. Repetitive phrasing ("fluidly logical," "vaulting hush") acts as a scaffold rather than a rhythmic device.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is heavily laden with abstract adjectives ("profound," "intricate," "unique") and clichés ("excitement and apprehension"). Adverbs like "politely" undermine the tone and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is functional but dense with clichés ("burning bridges," "forgotten promises," "clean scar") and abstract agents ("loaded emptiness filled the sanctuary"). The reliance on "purple" phrasing ("crucible of shared suffering") distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is readable but suffers from filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") and telling. While the glitchy text effect ("PURPLPURPLE") is a nice specific touch, phrases like "virtuously mischievous" and "shadowseam wonder" feel inserted to satisfy constraints rather than arising organically from the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("eloquently silent," "first yawn of evening," "golden shadows," "bridge of intuition") creates a distraction that mimics a glitched loop or template. The prose relies on adjective stuffing ("long, warm fingers," "deliberate and practiced") and "thesaurus-itis" rather than strong verbs. These artifacts pervade the text, including the climax and closure, severely damaging readability.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but weighed down by adjectival clutter and clichés ("hair on his arms stand erect," "shivered with bliss"). The phrasing "factually mystical" is jarringly inorganic, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("magnitude," "possibility") reduces line-level impact and density.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.5)
    The text suffers from a distraction typo or misuse ("unfurred" instead of unfurled) in the final paragraph. Phrasing is often repetitive ("accumulated dust patterns" appears twice verbatim) and leans into cliché ("fractured souls," "ache of grief"). The prose explains significance ("completely out of place") rather than allowing the image to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.5)
    The text contains catastrophic artifacts (random foreign characters and garbled words like "вони laughedнебр" and "حراج'") that destroy immersion and legibility. Phrasing is often clunky ("carefully resourceful rebel few noticed") and relies on modifying adjectives rather than strong verbs. These errors render the piece unpublishable in its current state.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of forced phrases ("vested hush," "quietly vivid," "eerie nostalgia"), which each appear three or more times in a short text. This creates a robotic, template-like cadence that shatters immersion. These artifacts suggest a checklist approach that overrides flow and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten with adverbs ("deftly," "meticulously," "carefully") and filter verbs ("she noticed," "felt," "caught her eye") that distance the reader. The phrase "always emerges transformed always" is repetitive and clumsy, likely a forced insertion that disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but suffers from significant "telling" and reliance on clichés ("scent of decay and rebirth," "terrifying and liberating"). Several sentences appear constructed primarily to house prompt phrases, resulting in awkward constructions like "uncertainly certain."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.3)
    Severe repetitive looping of the phrase "rain-washed" (used 5 times) and "Lumina/luminous" (used 6 times) indicates a lack of line-level control. The prose suffers from "telling" artifacts ("factually mystical," "essence of kintsugi") that clutter the narrative with prompt words instead of organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("luminous ache," "hidden sunrise," "modest fearlessness")—each appearing 2–3 times—creates a distracting, formulaic rhythm. These loops act as scaffold artifacts that disrupt the prose's flow and reduce the density of new information.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of clunky phrases ("proprioceptively enhanced," "pewter mask strap") creates a stuttering rhythm. The prose leans into purple descriptions ("sterile lingering," "inhaling shards of glass") instead of precise, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is repetitious and laden with abstract noun phrases that obscure the action; "elusively tangible" appears three times, and "anchors of intuition" twice, feeling like forced insertions. The reliance on "telling" creates a scaffolded feel, where the prompt phrases interrupt the natural flow of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "weightless burden" appears three times in a short space, and "horologist's mainspring barrel" is repeated clumsily. Clichés like "vanishing into thin air" and "hidden in plain sight" reduce freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the imagery is lush, the prose relies heavily on filter verbs at pivotal moments ("Eldon knew," "watched in awe," "understood," "realized"), which robs the climax of immediacy. Telling ("It wasn't mere curiosity... but a desperate longing") replaces showing in key character beats.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but laden with abstract nouns and repetitive sensory descriptors ("shimmering," "glimmered," "burnished"). There is a reliance on telling over showing ("His motivation burned brighter than any revolutionary flame"), and the rhythm is often flattened by expository heavy-lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is heavily overwritten with a density of similes ("like perfume," "like a violet," "like steam") that distracts from the action. Frequent use of filter verbs ("Elias knew," "he realized," "Elias felt") violates the show-don't-tell principle, creating a barrier between the reader and the events.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from adjective-noun clichés ("visceral understanding," "primordial darkness," "ethereal blue light") and filter verbs ("she experienced," "she comprehended"). The pacing is sluggish due to the explanatory weight, and the "awakenings" act as scaffold artifacts that clutter the line-level experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract telling ("Elena, being perpetually learning...") and awkward, mechanical insertion of required phrases ("turbine-hum reverie" used as a concrete noun). The rhythm is repetitive, and the text lacks sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("heart pounding," "scattered embers") and adjective stacking. High usage of filter verbs during the climax distances the reader from the sensory immediacy of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from heavy abstraction and clunky phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped," "chromatic memories"). There are significant artifacts of "telling," where complex processes are reduced to label-heavy sentences ("breathing truth in tension"). The rhythm is repetitive, often relying on participle phrases to accelerate summary information.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and sociological concepts ("economic structures," "cultural practices," "infrastructure improvements") that belong in a manifesto, not fiction. The lack of concrete verbs and sensory details kills narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose requires tightening; there are significant repetitive loops (e.g., "ancient" used repeatedly for symbols, orchard, and trees; "silence" used three times in the opening/closing). The opening sentence is cumbersome, and the explicit naming of emotions ("velvet disquiet") relies on telling rather than embodying the feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive labeling (the phrase "furious tranquility" appears twice) and "tell" constructions ("decreasing scale of entropy made manifest"). These artifacts obscure the mechanical reality of the scene in favor of abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose leans heavily on telling and summarization ("Elias documented... with meticulous care") rather than active scene work. There is a tendency toward overwriting ("whispered promise," "chaotic dance"), and the repetition of the prompt phrase "credulously curious" feels mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.5)
    A severe multilingual text artifact ("leaving ethereal痕迹 across") breaks the narrative spell and renders the piece unpublishable. The prose is further weakened by a high density of abstract nouns and clichés ("fabric of space-time," "captured sunbeam") that prioritize sound over specific meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant text artifacts disrupt the prose: "through contextual clues" appears three times as a clunky structural crutch, and "tangled covenant" is repeated five times. These verbatim repetitions create a scaffolded, artificial cadence that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("realized," "felt," "understood") and abstract telling ("simple yet profound"), which distances the reader from the on-page action. Information is largely conveyed through summary and exposition rather than concrete, sensory-driven scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and explicit scaffolding, telling the reader exactly how to interpret symbols ("a silent conversation between exuberance and reflection"). Frequent use of adjective-heavy phrases ("burnished hush," "cobalt lagoon") slows momentum and reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dominated by "telling" summaries ("Motivation crystallized," "architectural secrets revealed") and clichés ("symphony of light"). The repetition of prompt phrases like "brazen calm" feels mechanical, and the lack of specific, dense imagery flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose quality is severely hampered by a "template cadence" artifact where multi-word phrases ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious," "fly amber," "rainwashed tower") act as recurring filler. A critical causality/logic break occurs with the "dusty footprints" surviving "recent rains" outdoors, which undermines the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.2)
    A hallucinated text artifact ("ttk duelersi") in the second paragraph severely damages line-level integrity and clarity. The prose otherwise leans heavily on clichés ("fragile embrace," "weathered hands") and filter-heavy constructions that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy reliance on summary and telling over showing weakens the prose ("senses... awakened," "understood now what he must do"). The phrase "wild hush" is repeated four times (paras 1, 4, 9, 11), creating a distracting lexical loop.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is marred by significant repetitive artifacts: "gilded compass rose" appears four times and "temporally stretched" three times in a short text. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery ("confusion into exploration"), and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Phrasing often leans on forced oxymorons ("cautious abandon") and adverb-heavy telling ("sacredly playful") that dilute clarity. Abstract descriptors like "wrongness" are repeated without the concrete imagery needed to ground the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.4)
    Immediate fail state for a prestigious market due to the inclusion of placeholder text/artifacts ("[回注：这是中文，需要修正]") at the climax. Additionally, key phrases are repeated excessively (e.g., "nomadic penumbra" four times, "interregnum" four times) within a short word count, creating a distracting echo.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("force of a blow," "winter snow") and hollow scaffold phrases ("simple yet profound"). Metaphors are frequent but often mixed or standard, and the pacing is sluggish due to the reliance on summary over scene.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is competent but marred by the repetitive use of prompt phrases ("woven hush," "productive fidgeting," "fierce repose" each appear multiple times), creating a looping effect. Filtering ("he felt," "he could") distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=2.2)
    A jarring non-English text artifact ("hadтайное mission") and a clear grammar error ("price of paid") render the piece unpublishable in its current state. The prose is frequently overwritten with dense simile chains ("like ghosts," "like art daring convention," "like listening spirits") that clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjectival density ("tiny brass artifact," "strategically focused amber light," "corrosive emerald waters") that slows momentum. While clearly written, the reliance on abstract nouns paired with descriptors creates a texture that feels slightly overwrought. There are no major technical errors, but the style leans toward "telling" through elaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("quietly aging," "love's first blush") and purple phrasing ("porcelain impossibility"). There is a reliance on telling over showing, with abstract summaries of emotion replacing concrete action. Sentence rhythm is functional but rarely accelerates to match the intended emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from melodrama and the forced repetition of abstract phrases ("screaming tenderness" appears three times). Key emotional beats rely on "telling" via adjectives rather than concrete imagery. The writing is technically functional but lacks the density and freshness required for a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=2.9)
    A critical syntactical error inserts prompt instructions directly into the prose ("The fluctuates with moon phases attribute was peaking"), rendering the sentence illogical. The writing also relies on clichés ("heart swelling") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by "tell" indicators like "In that moment" and "Moments later" that bypass dramatic rendering. Some imagery is effective, but other phrases ("fractal patterns," "frozen lightning") feel slightly decorative without adding narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("He noticed," "Elias could taste") and heavy adjective use ("softly persistent," "iridescent haze"). The pivotal realization is told ("Elias understood now") rather than shown through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is polished but repetitive; &quot;glimmer&quot; and &quot;blooming&quot; are overused as descriptors. Phrasing occasionally drifts into stiffness (&quot;sustenance drawn from berries&quot;) that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("razor-sharp rocks," "ghostly precision") and purple abstractions ("bleeding starlight," "visceral visions"). Required phrases are inserted awkwardly as labels ("softly commanding presence" appears twice; "lacy menace" is told, not shown). Information density is low due to excessive adjectival padding.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun clutter ("profound density of presence," "physics of connection") and repetitious labeling ("scientifically romantic" appears twice). Several required phrases are shoehorned in as awkward metaphors ("palette of resolve expanded before her mind's eye") that disrupt the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is heavily laden with stock phrasing and adjectival padding ("trembling fingers," "meticulous care," "terrifying beauty," "impossible colors," "cosmic storyteller"). These artifacts obscure the imagery and reduce the line-level momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is polished but overwritten with "purple" metaphors ("vanished like morning mist," "vessels of human stories") that tell the reader how to feel. While clear, the writing lacks the density and propulsion required for the top bands, relying too much on abstract descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is functional but marred by significant clichés ("blank as newly fallen snow") and "told" emotions ("Panic surged," "awestruck"). These artifacts, along with some ornamental phrasing ("miniature dragons"), reduce the density and immediacy required for high-echelon publication.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" artifacts and abstract sensory mixing ("signature blend of jasmine and regret"). Metaphors are frequent and sometimes clichéd ("paper coffins," "scatter like startled birds"), drawing attention to the writing rather than the moment. Information density is lowered by these decorative flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten with abstract nouns and repetitive phrasing ("resounding hush" appears three times). Telling dominates showing, particularly in the climax where the solution is described as a "language of pure mathematics and emotion" rather than visualized. The text relies on "purple prose" metaphors that obscure rather than clarify the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The text contains a severe artifact at the end (cutting off mid-sentence with "The hydra"). Additionally, the phrase "eminently peculiar" is repeated three times as a label, creating a repetitive scaffold that detracts from the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("quiet wildfire," "revolutionize") and abstract noun stacking ("contours of light and shadow," "particles of light and energy"). Adjectives and interpretive labels clutter the sentences, reducing narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of specific phrases ("lucid contradictions" x3, "clover melancholy" x2, "traverse" x3, "candle lantern" x3) within a short word count. These artifacts read as a checklist being filled rather than natural narrative progression, disrupting immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe repetition of specific noun phrases hinders flow; "glass harmonica disc" appears eight times and "subway utility tunnel" five times in a short text. These lexical loops read as unedited scaffold rather than intentional rhythmic choices, significantly stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is marred by a heavy reliance on clichés ("winds of change," "creaking in protest," "fading light") and mechanical prompt insertion. The verbatim recurrence of phrases like "haunted euphoria" and "proximate causes" (three times each) creates a looping, scaffolded cadence that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is repetitive, recycling specific phrases ("desperately jocular," "polite anarchy," "disused railway station") multiple times within a short text. The reliance on summary syntax ("Archie would spread," "the rumor had passed") drains momentum and prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive strain, with phrases like "ultrasonic forest," "stillpoint," "shifting constellations," and "quiet blaze" looped frequently within a short space. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, and the reliance on "to be" verbs and filter constructions drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but marred by clichés ("rabbit hole," "written in pen, not stone") and "telling" structures ("believing they contained," "finding comfort"). The sentence rhythm is steady but lacks the variation or propulsion needed to create tension during the editing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("shimmered like scattered diamonds," "warm embrace," "tear-streaked cheeks") and repetitive phrasing ("joyful sorrow" appears three times). The reliance on abstract nouns and simile-heavy descriptions stifles momentum and weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition (four uses of "volcanic tenderness") and reliance on clichés ("ashes of her past," "whispering stories"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often using a "Subject was [Adjective]" pattern. The density of abstract nouns obscures concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but marred by stock metaphors and clichés ("ghost in the machine," "universe holding its breath," "liquid light") that flatten the imagery. The reliance on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "auroral," "impossible") reduces the impact of the specific, inventive setting.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("uncanny ability," "practiced ease," "profound clarity") and unmotivated repetition ("The geomagnetic storm had intensified" in paragraph 2, then "The geomagnetic storm was intensifying now" in paragraph 4). The "whisper" mechanics are described in vague terms ("strange acoustics") rather than concrete physical action, weakening the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and repetitive phrasing ("cobalt dock," "half-spoken secret," "patterns"), creating a loop effect. "Spiralingly calm" is a clunky, adverbal construction that disrupts rhythm. The reliance on telling ("defied simple explanation") over showing weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive diction is a significant issue; "cobalt" appears four times and the metaphor "forests of second thoughts" is used three times verbatim. Abstract phrasing like "beautiful chaos of human creativity" replaces concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on purple abstractions ("liquid moonlight," "ethereal light") and mixed metaphors ("dissolving into the water like salt sugar"). There is a notable typo ("combative tendleness") and a tendency toward cliché ("calloused hands," "golden light"). The rhythm is hypnotic but monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with evocative imagery like "sliced the sky" and "sepia and dust." The rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though the narration occasionally leans into abstraction when describing the significance of the carving.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("lantern-moth hush," "tremor of certainty," "dissolving boundaries" all repeated verbatim) which read as artifacts. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew") pervade the text, dulling immediacy. Clichés like "second skin," "perfect mirror," and "holding its breath" further flatten the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of stock phrases ("innocently cunning" used twice; "beauty in/of imperfection" used three times) and adjective clutter ("glowing molten beauty"). The density of abstract nouns and flowery descriptors slows momentum and creates a barrier to engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases ("powerfully gentle" x3, "golden shadows" x3, "artificial pilgrimage" x3) creates a distracting template cadence. The prose relies on abstract labels ("texture of connection") rather than concrete, sensory-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling and "purple" descriptors ("ethereal beam," "reverent, steady hands," "simple yet profound") instead of concrete imagery. There is significant reliance on "would" constructions (iterative aspect) which distances the reader and prevents scene-level immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent adverb usage ("methodically," "silently," "cautiously," "religiously") and abstract summary ("expanded exponentially"). The prompt phrase "steadily curious" is inserted awkwardly twice as a label rather than a demonstrated trait.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive labeling ("anguished joy" appears three times in variations) and heavy telling. Metaphors are often mixed or abstract ("atoms of nostalgia" treated as literal physics), and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "telling" emotions, most notably the direct labeling of "Luminous regret filled Elara," which bypasses embodied experience. There is a repetitive sentence structure (starting paragraphs with prepositional phrases or time markers) that creates a droning rhythm. Abstract descriptions ("effortlessly elegant," "ancient and knowing") replace concrete sensory details in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is overwritten with excessive adjectives and adverbs ("quietly vivid," "tender touch," "shimmering stillness") that clog momentum. The reliance on cliché phrasing ("shattered like glass") and repetitive sentence structures limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is clogged with abstract nouns ("integration," "miracle," "closure," "resilience") and repetitive phrasing ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to say"). Key phrases like "displaced miracle" and "meteor hush" are repeated to the point of semantic satiation (artifact loops). The reliance on "felt" and "understood" filters dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("spatially imaginative," "hushed thunder," "forgotten lyrics," "crystal gazer") creates a robotic, template-like cadence. The prose is dense with abstract nouns and adjectives ("quantum archive," "dimensional barriers") that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with "purple" artifacts, including stacked modifiers ("celestial hues," "nebulous concepts," "moonstruck face") and clichés ("heart soared," "dancing shadows"). This ornamentation obscures the causal logic and slows the narrative momentum without adding distinct information. The reliance on abstract concepts over concrete verbs weakens the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("glowing dune in bloom," "through wave functions") creates a robotic cadence and scaffold effect. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs and abstract telling rather than active showing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from a density of abstract nouns ("insight," "comprehension," "recognition," "transformation") that creates a vague, pseudo-philosophical texture. "Hum of insight crescendoed into comprehension" is a purple artifact that obscures rather than reveals the moment. Sentence structures are repetitive, often opening with "As" or the subject.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("thin as silk," "patient as stone," "weight of a star") and repetitive simile structures. Phrasing often drifts into abstraction ("liquid twilight," "ridgeway of possibilities") instead of grounding the fantasy in tactile specifics. The repetition of "shoreline lullaby" and "gentle persistence" feels forced rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.0)
    Phrasing is repetitive, with "nerve regeneration" appearing three times as a scaffold. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("he noticed," "he realized," "he understood") rather than direct, immersive action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe text-looping artifacts are present; complex phrases like "pause of shifting constellations," "diminutive titan," and "graceful collapse" are each repeated three times in a short text. This creates a mechanical, template-like cadence that obstructs flow. The prose relies on purple abstractions ("shimmered with the memory of what once was") over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally clean but relies on stock phrasing ("whispered of deeper changes," "danced... like schools of fish") that dulls the imagery. The repetition of the prompt phrase "periodically eternal" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from wordiness and abstract phrasing ("driven by a motivation to discover meaning," "defied all logic and explanation"). There is a reliance on telling over showing, with "seemed" and "felt" appearing frequently. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "noun phrase + relative clause" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is functional but heavily reliant on filter verbs ("feeling," "could hear," "saw") which distances the reader. Clichéd phrasing ("sound like thunder," "alive with possibility," "ancient energy") flattens the impact of the imagery. The reliance on summary prevents rhythmic variation or tension at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weakened by repetitive phrasing ("quiet presence... quietly talented") and the reliance on abstract telling over showing. The repeated use of the thematic thesis statement ("anchor optimism in realism") and clinical terms ("somatic markers") acts as a scaffold that distances the reader from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.7)
    Lexical control is weak, with significant unintended repetition ("forgotten library... forgotten memories" in one sentence; "fragmented" forms appear six times; "luminescent ache" three times). Adjective-noun pairings are often cliché ("cloying sadness," "gray oblivion"), and the prose relies on abstract metaphors over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from adjective/adverb clutter ("insatiable need," "stark contrast," "perfectly mimicking," "profound understanding"). These modifiers weaken the imagery, replacing concrete sensory proof with abstract assertions of quality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts dominate the prose; the phrase "echoing library under snow" appears four times, and "Within the blink that follows surprise" and "contraband truths" appear twice each in a very short text. This keyword stuffing creates a jarring, looping rhythm that obstructs narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is readable but dense with abstract nouns and "telling" constructions that stall momentum ("a trait that made her invaluable"). The phrase "senselessly perceptive" reads as an awkward prompt insertion that disrupts the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("patterns broke themselves," "sleepwalking constellations" each appear 3–4 times), creating a looping effect that reads more like prompt-checking than intentional refrain. Adjective-noun pairings are dense and often abstract ("weathered hand," "patient heart," "intangible feelings"), slowing the momentum. The syntactic rhythm is somewhat monotonous, lacking the variation needed to mirror the "chaos" described in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetitive looping of full noun phrases ("rosewood pen nib" x5, "echoing observatory above the clouds" x4, "orbits of regret" x3) creates a mechanical, robotic rhythm. The prose is cluttered with unearned adjectives and "tell" constructions ("fingers dancing... with practiced precision") that distance the reader. These artifacts obscure narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose relies on stock phrasing ("tears streamed," "folding like origami") and adjective-heavy constructions ("haunted firmware," "ancient servers") that dull the imagery. The flow is functional but lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose depends on "telling" over showing ("socially perceptive in ways that defied ordinary understanding") and leans on forced descriptors ("lilac unease"). Clichéd similes and abstract phrasing dilute the clarity of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from heavy adjective stacking and clunky abstract phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped," "warm coldness"). "Filter verbs" ("Elias knew," "Elias saw") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The writing relies on oxymorons ("gentle radical," "arms of steel") as shortcuts for description rather than earning these traits through action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" over-description and abstract synesthesia that confuses rather than clarifies ("petals tasting like laughter," "scent of starlight"). Clichés like "ripples of despair" and "receding like a tide" weaken the imagery. There is a reliance on scaffolding structures ("As the echoes..." "With each passing moment...") that creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme repetitive artifacting; phrases like "fractally precise," "muscovite geode sliver," and "willowglass hope" appear 3–4 times each in a short text, creating a jarring, loop-like rhythm. This redundancy signals a failure to integrate prompts organically, resulting in low information density and scaffold-heavy sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by filter verbs ("Maya felt," "she realized") and clunky, expository sentence structures. The insertion of required phrases results in syntactic awkwardness (e.g., "truly factually mystical") that mars the line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is grammatically clean but relies heavily on clichés ("ripples in a pond," "tapestry of fate," "practiced hands"). Sentence structures are repetitive, and the text lacks the density or friction required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant textual artifacts mar the prose, including the verbatim repetition of &quot;silver hush&quot; (3x) and &quot;at the tilt of the earth toward spring&quot; (2x). The usage of &quot;vouchsafe&quot; feels forced and slightly misused in the first instance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=2.9)
    Significant repetitive artifacts drag the prose down; "rain gutters... ticking" appears four times, and unique phrases like "spindrift serenity," "closely attentive," and "percolate" are repeated verbatim in a short space. Usage errors ("droplets that still percolated from the eaves") and jargon-like constructions ("through ambient awareness") obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    The phrase "sharp gentleness" is repeated three times in a short text, creating a distracting lexical loop. "Inexplicably" and "thrum" serve as weak descriptors, and the prose lacks the density to support its high-concept claims.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is competent but marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("protected vulnerability") that disrupt the rhythm. Logical inconsistencies appear in the line-level description, such as "working with the rhythm of oars" while she is stationary and reflecting light.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns weakens impact. The phrase "atomically reflective" is repeated three times, creating a jarring text artifact. Metaphors like "currents of knowledge" and "tides of wisdom" border on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.0)
    The text suffers severely from repetitive looping of specific phrases, likely prompt-driven artifacts. "Inevitably whimsical," "keeper of secrets," "prismatic quiet," "after the cloud bursts," and "thrush's nest twig spiral" are each repeated 3–4 times in a short space, creating a jarring, template-like cadence. This synonym churn and phrase-stuffing obscures the narrative flow and creates a mechanical texture. The constant repetition prevents any immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by excessive adjectives and clunky phrasing ("missed the subsonic realm entirely"). Forced insertion of prompt phrases ("ethereal grit," "cautiously hopeful") disrupts the natural rhythm and draws attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective-noun pairings ("pressing darkness," "cosmic possibility," "intricate design") and adverbs ("uncomfortably," "prudently"). Phrasing often tells rather than shows ("It was an unprecedented act"), reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("web of contradictions," "stamped in red") and awkward syntax ("notebook completed with previous similar cases"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "furrowed hush" (narrative and description) is a visible artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.0)
    Repetitive phrasing ("nervously confident," "spongey dread," "idealistic map librarian") creates a scaffold effect that dulls the prose. Sentences are frequently overloaded with backstory clauses that disrupt the rhythm of the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is weighed down by purple abstractions and mixed metaphors ("sculpt possibility from the ashes," "symphony of pixelated amnesty"). The phrase "dynamically observant frame" is a particularly clunky violation of show-don't-tell, literalizing a trait into a physical description.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts present; "perceptively calm" appears five times, and "dusky harmony" and "territorial markers" three times each, including in the closure beat. These verbatim loops function as text artifacts that break immersion and indicate a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of scaffold phrases ("daylily-pressed telegram," "midnight solace," "understanding dawning") which appear multiple times as fixed epithets. Abstract nouns replace concrete verbs, creating a sluggish rhythm. The reliance on these repeated, specific phrases creates a "looping" artifact effect that drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of full noun phrases ("swirling orchard vortex" x5, "flesh-eating plant seed" x4) creates a robotic, template-like cadence. Adjective-heavy description clutters the prose without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    Repetitive phrasing ("anxious elation" appears twice verbatim; "visionary" five times) and overuse of adjectives weaken the prose. The text relies on telling ("understood now") and passive constructions ("had been obscured," "had been destroyed") that drain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by repetitive word choices (four uses of "fierce/fiercely," two of "hummed") and abstract mixed metaphors like "feathers of resolve rustled internally." These artifacts distract from the imagery and suggest a lack of line-level polish. The writing tells more than it shows, reducing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from stock phrases ("dust and resignation," "neither here nor there") and diction errors ("wrested" a magnifying glass from a drawer). The explicit repetition of the prompt's thematic keywords in the narration creates a "paint-by-numbers" feel that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically competent and polished but suffers from density of exposition and abstract phrasing ("physics of transition," "lineage of knowledge"). The reliance on "telling" creates a flat rhythm, lacking the propulsion of concrete action or sensory immediacy in the moment-to-moment narration.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by "telling" summaries and abstract phrasing ("essence of forgotten tales," "warmth of memories"). Several lines rely on cliché imagery ("cold fire") or pseudo-profound paradoxes that obscure meaning rather than clarifying it. The sentence rhythm is somewhat repetitive, often following a "The librarian [verb]" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is functional but cluttered with clichés ("cutting through the darkness," "liquid sunlight") and abstract nouns that do the work of concrete imagery. There is a tendency toward "purple" description that prioritizes sounding poetic over clarity and density, resulting in a text that feels polished but superficial.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is marred by "purple" descriptions ("warehouse of memories," "clawed... like desperate fingers") and repetitive phrasing of prompt elements. Artifacts are frequent: "daringly methodical" and "truth-seeking river chronicler" are repeated verbatim as labels. The density is low, with many sentences dedicated to abstracting emotion rather than showing action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive adjective-noun pairings ("fateful letter," "cryptic message," "cautious exuberance," "ill-gotten gains"). This reliance on modifiers and clichés ("ripple like water") dilutes the imagery and slows momentum. The writing tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe text-generation artifact ("chaotic水下摄影") disrupts the prose in the second paragraph, rendering the line nonsensical and breaking immersion. Additionally, the prose tends toward adjective density ("resilient greenhouse," "complex chord") that occasionally clogs the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is weighed down by cliché pairings ("practiced grace," "radiant hush") and adjective stacking. Repetition of prompt phrases ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush") creates a mechanical, scaffolded feel rather than organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers severely from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("kindly decisive," "vineyard hush," "scalloped") which appear verbatim multiple times, creating a mechanical, template-like rhythm. These artifacts, combined with heavy filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw"), obstruct the flow and distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is polished but dense with clichés ("etched with exhaustion," "glass wall") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader. Label-speak ("protected vulnerability") replaces concrete, sensory depiction of the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward insertions of required phrases ("Through the patterns... wisdom emerges") that disrupt syntactic flow. Abstract telling ("chronological paradox," "ethereal light") replaces concrete showing in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from tautologies ("weathered resolve etched into his determined brow") and heavy adjectival clutter. Key phrases are repeated to the point of redundancy ("weathered resolve" appears twice; "pulse left wandering" three times) without accumulating new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive diction (the word "automated" appears ~8 times; the phrase "brilliant dimness" repeats three times). Heavy reliance on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("perfect geometries," "practiced ease," "deliberate fingers") creates a "telling" effect that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mechanics are clean, but the repetition of specific prompt phrases ("meteor hush" appears twice; "luminous vow" multiple times) creates artifacts. The prose lacks propulsion, relying on a "then this happened" rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=2.6)
    Line-level craft is dominated by the clumsy insertion of prompt terms, leading to "synonym loops" and "template cadence" artifacts (e.g., "quiet enthusiasm" appears five times). The prose relies heavily on telling over showing, with clunky constructions like "motivation to wavelength align with purpose" disrupting readability and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe keyword stuffing and repetition artifacts. Variations of "crystallize" appear five times and "scattered light" four times in a short span, deadening the impact. The reliance on adjective-heavy construction slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is readable but marred by abstraction ("sound like settling stars") and the repetitive use of key terms like "lukewarm" and "devotion." The magical mechanics are described in vague, slightly purple terms that obscure the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from adjective-noun padding ("solitary vigil," "faithful," "newly exposed") and cliche ("painted the horizon"). Phrases are repeated verbatim ("precisely humane," "spinning silence into meaning") creating unintended loops that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is weighed down by adverbs ("carefully," "gently") and cliché descriptors ("all colors imaginable"). The phrase "ancient freshness" is an awkward oxymoron that disrupts the rhythm and feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from critical structural looping, with identical phrases and sentence structures repeated three times in a rigid cycle (paragraphs 2/16/25, 4/13/22, 7/14/23). This level of "template cadence" triggers maximum deductions for artifacts, as the writing foregrounds its own mechanical constraints over narrative flow or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by unnecessary modification ("specialized adhesive that wouldn't dissolve") and passive constructions ("had been tasked"). Sentences often lack propulsion, relying on "was/were" verbs and abstract nouns that reduce information density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("notably receptive mind" x3, "storm-born silence" x3, "orthogonal approaches" x3). These artifacts read as mechanical insertions rather than organic motifs, creating a stuttering rhythm that distracts from the narrative flow. This heavy looping violates the standard for polished, publishable literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of long prompt strings ("via half-sung lullabies...", "echo chamber tunnel", "mournfully eager") which destroys rhythm and creates a scaffolded, algorithmic texture. These loops occur frequently enough to distract from the otherwise functional imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("interiorizing exteriors" appears three times; "foggy lucidity" twice) and dense, adjective-heavy description that slows momentum. Abstract diction ("patchwork illusion of connection," "transcended all dimensions") replaces concrete imagery, creating a barrier to immersion. The density feels decorative rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is burdened by excessive adjective stuffing ("stoically sensitive nature", "melancholy beauty", "dormant power") and cliché phrasing ("ancient wisdom", "weathered hands"). The use of the modern idiom "penny dropped" constitutes a jarring register break within the established high-fantasy context.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is mechanically sound but suffers from overwriting and abstract descriptions of action ("moved in practiced patterns," "tuning... with intention"). Modifiers often clutter images without adding precision, and the reliance on "telling" the internal process distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from adverb heaviness and repetitive phrasing ("interconnected patterns" appears three times). The integration of required phrases is clumsy, resulting in clunky sentences that break narrative immersion (e.g., the "resiliently positive" dialogue tag).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is dense with abstract nouns ("possibility," "truth," "connection") and clichés ("dissolve like mist," "beating as one"); adverbs and adjectives do the work that strong verbs should do.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("somber marvel" and "unfolded horizons" both appear twice in a very short text) and awkward constructions like "balancedly curious." These lexical loops and adjectival stacks clutter the density and reduce the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe artifact penalties apply for loop repetitions; "reeling hush," "persistently curious," and "decades-old" each appear three times in a short space. These repetitive tags create a template-like cadence that breaks immersion and signals forced insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose relies on tired personification ("air licked," "facility yawned") and adjective-heavy telling that slows momentum. The specific artifact name ("Codex margin illuminant gold fleck") is clunky and disrupts the rhythm of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is polished but decorative, relying on stock poetic phrases ("snow globe of night," "web of chaos") that prioritize sound over precision. While functional, the sentence rhythm is monotonous, often looping back to explain what was just shown.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on stock descriptors ("ancient sentinels," "lavender and gold") and passive constructions that dull momentum. Telling frequently replaces showing, particularly in the climax where the diamond's function is explained rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weakened by abstract metaphors ("frostbitten hope") and a grammatical error where the prompt verb "metamorphose" is forced into use as a noun ("witness the metamorphose"). Rhythms are sluggish and heavy with adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("miracle," "tarnished wonder," "profound release") which distances the reader from the action. While mechanically functional, the sentence structures are repetitive, and phrasing like "resonantly soft" feels forced to meet the prompt rather than organically woven into the description.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional and clear but relies on standard descriptors ("weathered face," "artificial life") and summary. The rhythm is steady but lacks the syntactic propulsion or density required to heighten the low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is cluttered with filter verbs ("caught the carpenter's eye," "felt an irresistible urge," "seemed to beckon") that distance the reader from the action. Abstract nouns dominate over concrete imagery, and the repetitive use of prompt phrases as proper nouns ("the misting hush") creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers from severe phrase-looping and artifact insertion. Specific phrases ("tattered silk scarf," "analog memories," "sanely eccentric," "hyperbolic geometry") are repeated verbatim 3–5 times each in a short space, creating a mechanical, template-like rhythm. This repetition creates a drag on momentum and feels like a checklist rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract telling ("process was alchemical," "essence of light") and cliché phrasing ("tears blurred her vision"). The insertion of prompt phrases feels mechanical, and the reliance on adjectives over strong verbs dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by "tell" constructions and awkward constraint insertions like "unassumingly bold" used as an epithet. Imagery is standard ("indigo and lavender"), and the rhythm is static.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition of complex phrases damages the prose quality; "chronically curious nature" and "crisp nostalgia" both appear twice in a very short text. These lexical loops create a robotic, unedited feel that disrupts immersion and signals a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and clear but prone to adjectival padding ("rich, dark leaves," "dust-laden silence") and stock phrasings. The mechanics of the scene are rendered well, but the line-level craft lacks the distinct rhythmic signature or freshness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("ancient secrets," "shimmered with potential") and "purple" abstractions ("hush of budding hope"). Repetitive phrasing ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "heirloom seed") and a reliance on template sentence structures create a monotonous rhythm that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose flows well but suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("interlaced hush" appears four times; "accumulated silence" three times). The opening paragraph relies heavily on telling ("visible marker of the turmoil within") rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is competent but marred by "telling" over "showing" and the repetition of specific phrases ("methodically curious"). The reliance on abstract nouns ("profound desire," "profound sense") dilutes the impact of the imagery. The narrative flow is slowed by the summary nature of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("first name basis with death," "tears welling") and filter verbs ("Elara knew," "she understood"). The writing frequently tells the reader how to feel about the imagery rather than letting the imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily reliant on the habitual past ("would ascend," "had found," "was"), which kills narrative momentum and immediacy. Imagery leans on clichés ("time stretches like taffy") and purple abstractions ("tinkersong wonder," "digital palimpsests"). The text tells rather than shows, summarizing complex interactions into vague "harmonies" and "dances."

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.9)
    The text contains a severe generation artifact/glitch (the Chinese characters "化作" appear in the penultimate paragraph), rendering it unpublishable. Additionally, the prose suffers from a massive template-cadence failure, with nearly every paragraph beginning with a floor count, and basic grammar errors ("hadn't just solve a mystery").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward integration of prompt phrases ("motivation burning quietly explosive" is syntactically strained). Rhythmic monotony and a reliance on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("seemed," "envisioning") and clichéd phrases ("curiosity piqued," "just so") that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of specific phrases ("antique airship," "stranded luminance," "great discovery") and stems ("diligently curious," "meticulously curious"). Heavy reliance on adverbs and physical clichés ("trembling fingers," "heart racing") flattens the impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=2.1)
    The text suffers critically from verbatim repetition of lengthy phrases (e.g., "Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears three times), creating massive text artifacts. These loops destroy narrative flow and read like a checklist of required phrases rather than organic storytelling, persisting even into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose relies heavily on telling and abstract summary ("relationships deepened," "troubles were brewing") rather than concrete sensory detail. Phrasing is occasionally clumsy ("strangers fully become family"), and "Arche studying" appears to be a typo or an undefined proper noun.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    Repetition of required phrases ("pane of hush," "beautifully flawed") creates noticeable drag. A spacing typo ("theBeautifully") and awkward grammar ("began the action, vouchsafe") mar the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward insertions of prompt phrases ("offhandedly exact in all his measurements") that disrupt rhythm. The writing leans on clichés ("hues of violet and amber") and lacks density.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is mechanically competent but weighed down by filter verbs ("saw," "noticed," "realized") and abstract summaries of thought. The reliance on clichés ("pieces were falling into place," "grief had loosened its grip") flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjective clutter ("gentle shadows," "carefully positioned," "deepest motivation") and filter verbs. Key phrases from the prompt ("mindfully scattered," "glimmering parole") are repeated verbatim in close proximity, creating noticeable lexical loops that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetition of specific descriptors ("sturdy" and "brittle" appear five times each; "subsumed" three times) creates a jarring, artificial cadence. The prose relies heavily on telling ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and clunky phrasing ("sandpaper rough memories") that obscures the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwritten and relies heavily on abstract modifier strings ("empathetically decisive grace," "resonant authority") that clutter the sentences without adding precision. The narrative relies on summary telling instead of concrete showing, and the repetition of prompt phrases ("vigorous tender," "hush of borrowed starlight") feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and relies on repetitive use of prompt phrases ("synaptic plasticity," "quaking reverie") as narrative crutches. The reliance on "tell-y" abstractions ("thoughts spiraling like DNA") obscures concrete imagery and weakens the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from "scaffold loops," with multi-word phrases repeated verbatim three or more times (e.g., "clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze," "manuscript margin doodle"). This heavy repetition draws attention to the writing as an artificial construct and halts narrative momentum. Additionally, the climax relies on "telling" (summarizing the puzzle solving) rather than "showing" the action.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on stock metaphors and clichés ("whispered secrets," "grace of a shadow," "tapestry of connection," "winter ice") that dull the imagery. Sentimental phrasing ("tears... like tiny prisms of sound") undermines the potential for sharper, more tactile description.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    Visible text artifacts and loops drag the score down; phrases like "thoughtfully precise" and "hopeful melancholy" are repeated clumsily. The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and summary ("correlate," "patterns") rather than concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts damage the prose; phrases like "eclectic pacifist," "shadowed workshop under stars," and "final stillness before fireworks" each appear three times in a short text, creating a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.7)
    Line-level execution suffers from tautologies ("olfactorily sensitive senses") and grammatical friction ("journalize project"). The prose leans toward purple description ("turning of the tide's thought") that obscures clarity without adding genuine depth.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on standard adjective-noun pairings ("deafening void," "violent gravitational shift," "otherworldly green light") and cliché phrasing ("throbbed with ancient power"). The pacing is sluggish due to filtering ("He saw," "He knew") and a lack of sentence-level propulsion during the action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose relies on telling and summary ("Her actions were deliberate," "Her rapidly adapting mind processed") rather than immediate, sensory-dense action. Several clichés ("dying afternoon light," "switch had been flipped") and the repetitive use of prompt phrases as scaffold weaken the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract metaphors ("unfetter potential energies," "woven from starlight") that create a static, ornamental texture. Heavy use of filter verbs ("visible to her," "felt") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from repetitive diction (e.g., "weathered" appears three times for different objects; "avalanchingly quiet" is repeated three times). Reliance on heavy-handed adverbs ("carefully," "exponentially," "instinctively") and clichéd phrasing ("tears were streaming," "weight... pressing") weakens the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("practiced precision," "otherworldly luminescence," "deliberate ambiguity") that clutter the rhythm. Several moments tell rather than show ("calculated to disorient"), and the final paragraph dissolves into abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("vibrating sympathetically" x4, "absent mentor" x4) within a short word count creates a distracting template-fill effect. The prose suffers from "thematic echo," restating the premise of "wonder" multiple times rather than advancing the action. The text lacks density and propulsion, relying on scaffolded descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence stems (nearly every paragraph begins with "Elara [verb]") and clunky, verbatim insertion of required phrases that break syntactic flow. The phrasing "hum with a shifted hush" and "critical timeframe when assumptions shatter" reads as artificial scaffolding rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally polished but leans into overwrought phrasing ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry") that obscures rather than clarifies. Filter verbs ("noticed," "feeling") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition (variations of "azure," "purpose," and "quiet" appear frequently in a very short text). The writing relies heavily on "telling" and scaffolding ("His motivation was clear," "The action he took was deliberate") instead of showing action. The phrasing is often clunky, notably the awkward attribution of "azure defiance" to a physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction ("shimmering possibilities," "pulsing with forgotten histories") that obscures concrete imagery. Clichés like "reality began to fray" and "morning mist" dilute the descriptive power. The text tells rather than shows, summarizing vast experiences instead of dramatizing specific moments.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    Contains a distinct grammatical error ("a tiny grains") and tautological phrasing ("repaired connections restored") that disrupts flow. The prose frequently relies on adjective-heavy abstraction ("quiet intensity") rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.5)
    A visible foreign-text artifact ("室白鲟") appears in the text, rendering the prose unpublishable. Additionally, the phrase "shadowed elation" is looped three times verbatim within a short space, creating a repetitive echo that dulls the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but repetitive, with key prompt phrases ("quietly explosive," "iridescent") appearing multiple times in close proximity. Abstract metaphors often obscure rather than clarify the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is marred by repetitive intensifiers ("impossibly ancient," "impossibly loud" in close proximity) and clunky syntax required to house the prompt phrasing. The reliance on adverbs ("gingerly," "silently") and telling ("The mundane miracle was clear") reduces density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is competent but repetitive, relying heavily on demonstrative openers ("This was the method," "This was how") and abstract nouns ("possibility," "potential"). Phrases like "taking a deep breath" and "fractured glass" feel clichéd, and the text explains the magic's effect instead of grounding it in concrete, immediate imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("nestled paradoxes" appears five times; "wisdom" seven times). Abstract nouns clutter the sentences, and the reliance on "telling" constructions ("allowed her to feel," "understood that") creates a passive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level execution is marred by conspicuous typos ("Elima", "fall,drops") and forced phrasing ("heuristically gentle approach") that clashes with the literary tone. Sentence structures are repetitive, often relying on "Eliza [verb]" openers (Eliza noticed, Eliza walked, Eliza placed, Eliza knew).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts and loop penalties, with full phrases repeated verbatim within a short word count. The text is also dense with weak adjective-noun pairings ("quiet energy," "gently meticulous," "ethereal light") that tell rather than show, resulting in a cluttered and static style.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is marred by clichés ("shattered like dropped glass," "eyes narrowed") and the clumsy insertion of required phrases. The writing lacks density, relying on scaffolding and adjectives rather than strong verbs and specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe artifacting and repetition; the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears five times in a very short text, acting as a clunky modifier rather than a meaningful description. Similarly, "luminous skeptic" is repeated as a proper noun to the point of distraction. These loops stifle narrative momentum and highlight the forced insertion of prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose suffers from pervasive "purple" writing and mixed metaphors ("melodies of discovery... echoed," "auroral sorrow"). Clunky phrasing ("pocket-stolen charcoal," "shattered his confidence into art's version of a broken combination lock") obscures meaning and drags on pacing. Adjective density is high, often resulting in redundant or confusing image pairs ("luminous regret").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is functional and grammatically polished, but suffers from adjective stacking and filter verbs ("Elara believed," "noticing for the first time"). The prose lacks muscularity; the rhythm is often slow and expository. There are no major mechanical errors, but the style draws attention to itself at the expense of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is mechanically functional but relies entirely on summary and exposition ("words had become unnecessary," "inspiration struck"). There is a lack of scene-level propulsion or density; broad time-skips dilute the impact of specific images. Telling replaces showing at every pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.9)
    The specific phrase "strangely organic" is repeated three times, becoming a distracting text artifact. Words like "fractured" and "fragment" also repeat frequently within a short space, reducing lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but saturated with clichés ("expert eye," "faded handwriting," "steaming cups") and abstract phrasing. The writing favors adjectival padding over strong verbs, resulting in a smooth but texturally bland surface that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.4)
    Significant text artifacts and looping harm the prose quality. The phrase "mysterious familiarity" is repeated three times verbatim, as is the simile "as a spider spins its web," and variations of "explain through dance." These repetitions read like unedited insertions rather than intentional motifs, stalling momentum and flattening the style.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by cliché phrasings ("practiced hands," "trembling hands," "heart lighter than it had been in years"). The repetition of "gleaming silence" works as a structural echo but feels ornamental, and the climax relies on "tell" descriptors ("defied normal physics").

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("quiet brook," "solitary summoner," "terrestrially cosmic") acts as scaffolding that dulls the prose. The text suffers from significant adjective clutter and abstract modifiers that obscure rather than reveal the action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose relies on clichés ("grace that belied his... years," "spark of recognition") and awkward phrasings ("patiently nimble") that distract from the imagery. There is a reliance on telling over showing, particularly in the summary of their developing relationship ("agreed upon lies").

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe artifacting is present through the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("whispering seashell half," "charmed skeptic," "quarantined memories," "ghostly resolve"). This looping creates a drumbeat of redundancy that destroys flow. The prose consists largely of scaffold sentences designed to house these phrases rather than advance the story.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from "telling" over "showing" and awkward prompt insertions like "wisely enduring home," which creates a jarring syntactic artifact. Repetitive phrasing ("pearl twilight," "stalactites") within a short word count reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=1.8)
    The text suffers from severe artifact loops; phrases like "richly perceptive," "webs of intrigue," and "progressive disclosure" are repeated verbatim multiple times in a short space. This extreme repetition destroys narrative momentum and creates a robotic, fill-in-the-blanks texture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting, repeating the exact phrases "borrowed starlight," "windows of connection," and "salvage something pure" three times each within a very short word count. These repetitions act as clumsy scaffolding that disrupts rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by forced oxymorons ("scintillatingly somber") and abstract noun pairings that obscure rather than reveal. The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on "telling" the philosopher's mindset stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=2.7)
    Prose is heavily filtered ("Maya traced," "Maya felt," "Maya watched") and relies on telling over showing. The phrase "sharply observant" is repeated as a crutch, and the "days" summary destroys the line-level momentum expected in a short story.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors (fingertips "stained by... midnight oil," treating an idiom as a physical substance) and heavy adjectival stacking. While grammatically functional, the reliance on abstract nouns and iterative verbs ("would unfold," "spent his nights") creates a sluggish, expository rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from adjective-heavy construction and "synonym churn" ("ornate yet tarnished," "obscured by years of neglect"). Phrases like "dawn's earliest whistle" function as decorative timestamps rather than grounded details. The line-level density is low, with many sentences restating the emotional intent of the previous one.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("darkness embracing him like an old friend," "weighed heavily," "satisfying click") and purple descriptors ("blood-red horizon"). While mechanically functional, the reliance on stock phrases and filter verbs ("Elias knew," "feeling the low hum") dulls the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant repetitive phrasing artifacts diminish quality, with "softly purposeful" and "restrained wildness" both appearing twice as identical labels. The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("vigilante horizon mapper," "gentle resonance") and abstract telling, which slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive labeling and prompt-word insertion. The phrases "watchfully calm," "fortified vulnerability," and "reverberate" are repeated multiple times in a short space, acting as static tags rather than organic descriptions. This repetition creates a mechanical rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose flow is disrupted by forced phrasing to accommodate required elements (e.g., "chimed aptly deliberate" is grammatically awkward). The narrative relies on "telling" via filter verbs ("realized," "recalling") rather than immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level execution is marred by a noticeable typo ("kaleinoscope") and repetitive phrasing ("curiosity piqued... piqued the glider's" in adjacent lines). The prose relies on telling over showing ("With reverence tempered by irreverence"), and sentence structures are repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés and mixed metaphors ("digital breadcrumbs," "silent scream," "ghosts in the machine," "burning a hole in her memory"). Phrasing is often clunky ("Being brightly attentive to details others overlooked"), and the reliance on "telling" over "showing" flattens the impact of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)

The forced insertion of required phrases (e.g., "weighted breath," "courageously anomalous") creates jarring rhythmic artifacts that disrupt the reading flow. Information density is low due to abstract summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from abstract metaphors and sentimental phrasing ("windborne solace filled her lungs," "tears freezing on her cheeks") that weaken clarity. Significant reliance on filter verbs ("she found herself," "she realized") and repetitive "solace" descriptors creates a barrier to immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe mechanical repetition of sentence stems ("Drawing parallels..." appears five times; "After the final bus..." three times) creates a distracting, list-like cadence. This template-based structure destroys narrative flow and reads like a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is mechanically sound but leans toward purple phrasing ("obsidian concealment") and abstract descriptors ("whisperfield calm"). Reliance on "telling" the magic through abstract nouns weakens the visceral impact of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but heavily reliant on abstract nouns and purple phrasing ("transmuting pain into a masterpiece") instead of concrete imagery. The repetition of specific prompt phrases (e.g., "earnest whimsy" used twice as a noun phrase) creates noticeable artifacts. Sentence structures are often repetitive, utilizing similar introductory scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose suffers from extreme "synonym churn" and looping artifacts, with phrases like "weathered innocence" and "fractured sequences" repeated 4–5 times in a short text. This repetitive phrasing acts as a massive distraction, breaking the immersive quality and signaling a lack of line-level craft and editorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.4)
    The phrase "arranging driftwood as directional markers" is repeated three times (in narration and dialogue), creating a distracting mechanical loop that stalls momentum. The prose tends toward abstraction ("melody of time passing") where concrete imagery is needed to anchor the magical realism. These artifacts suggest a lack of line-level polish and editorial scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive vocabulary (three uses of "luminous/ache") and a jarring word choice error ("leathered the boundaries," likely meant "tethered"). The reliance on abstract nouns creates a vague texture that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=2.8)
    Significant repetition artifacts; "radiant haven," "scent of hope," and "pulsing stillness" are each repeated three times in a short space, acting as mechanical keyword scaffolds. This redundancy flattens the prose and obscuring any natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers severely from keyword stuffing, with full phrases ("clockwork automaton key," "budding rune scholar," "sealed awakenings") repeated verbatim multiple times in a short space. This repetition creates a template-like cadence that disrupts flow and signals a lack of syntactic control.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose density is diluted by abstract labeling ("shrewdly innocent," "nostalgic innovation") and adjective stacking. Tells frequently replace shows (e.g., "defying all rational explanation," "skepticism finally and fully yielding"), reducing immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on adjective-noun pairings and abstract descriptions ("perfect sphere of calm," "ocean's patient hands"). The metaphorical language occasionally becomes mixed or purple ("zephyr bloom of inspiration"), and the reliance on summary stifles momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and therapy-speak ("reconciliation," "identity," "impossible ideals"). The repetition of specific, complex phrases ("honeyed hush," "protected vulnerability," "watchful dreamer") acts as a noticeable text artifact that creates a looping effect and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from loop artifacts; distinct multi-word phrases ("lucidly watchful," "against the current," "swirling hush," "collect the shapes of different hopes") are repeated verbatim three to four times each in a short space. This "copy-paste" repetition destroys rhythm and immersion. The writing relies heavily on weak telling and abstract nouns instead of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("slipping away like sand through fingers," "gathering hush," "practiced hands") and vague modifiers. The text tells rather than shows ("worked feverishly," "spun golden stories"), and the repetition of the phrase "verdant arbor" feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is polished but dense with "purple" adjective-noun pairings ("deliberate slowness," "ancient pulse") and static "to be" verbs. The rhythm is sluggish, often telling the reader the significance of an object rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrasing ("wounded season" appears four times; "reflective" forms frequent loops) creates a scaffold effect that drags on the prose. Some metaphors are slightly mixed or overwrought ("weighed lighter... as if its function had evaporated"), reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers severely from "text artifacts" and scaffold loops; full phrases like "kerosene lamp burner," "shingled hush," and "orienting properly" are repeated verbatim 3-5 times each within a short space. This excessive repetition creates a laundry-list effect that drastically reduces readability and momentum, signaling a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.5)
    A jarring text artifact ("his指纹") in paragraph six disrupts the reading flow and signals a significant proofreading failure. The prose is frequently overwritten and repetitive ("crystallized time," "rust-hued"), relying on adjective-heavy description that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by pervasive modifier stacking ("weathered hands," "ancient incantation," "shimmering surface") and abstract formulations. This over-reliance on adjectives to carry weight creates a sluggish rhythm and obscures the concrete action under layers of "purple" description.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("echoing with emptiness," "stars awakening") and repetitive phrasing ("stoic determination," "stoic wonder"). The phrase "functionally creative" is inserted awkwardly as a label, and "maze of intentions" is repeated verbatim, indicating a limited lexical pool.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant loop artifacts lower the score: specific long phrases are repeated verbatim across multiple paragraphs ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain," "soundless sanctuary"). Additionally, "scent of petrichor nostalgia" creates a jarring abstract-concrete mix.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive insertion of full prompt phrases (e.g., "antique pocket sundial" x3, "errant legend seeker" x3) which creates a mechanical, stilted rhythm. Phrasing like "thoughtfully clear precision" is awkward and abstract, reducing line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose relies heavily on telling ("served as a reminder," "thrill of understanding") and filter verbs ("noticed," "felt"). Repetitive phrasing ("infinitely patient/grateful," "oceanic hush") creates a distinct scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose flow is severely hampered by the mechanical repetition of prompt keywords ("shadowed garden" x5, "lonesome splendor" x2, "geography of..." x3). These artifacts create a stilted, checklist-like rhythm that obscures the otherwise competent sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent with clear imagery, though it relies heavily on abstract nouns ("beauty," "perfection," "genesis") and "was + verb" constructions. The phrase "quaking reverie" feels stitched in to satisfy the prompt rather than arising organically.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("obsidian lagoon" x4, "migration of clouds" x4, "scars can sing" x3) creates a distracting, algorithmic cadence. The prose relies on telling rather than showing, with low information density and frequent use of clunky "as [clause]" sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe "text artifact" looping, repeating specific phrases ("realistically imaginative," "defiant hush," "sidereal patience") to the point of distraction. The opening metaphor ("hair catching the dim light like a luminous skeptic") is logically incoherent and signals a lack of control over figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetitive looping of specific phrases ("Across the quiet sigh of falling petals," "approximating infinity") creates a mechanical, glitch-like rhythm. These distinct artifacts appear 4–5 times each in a short space, stalling momentum and obscuring the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive use of prompt phrases ("fiercely meditative" x2, "thundering calm" x3) which act as labels rather than descriptions. The reliance on summary and abstract phrasing ("unsettled spirits," "something profound") dilutes the immediacy of the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    Required phrases like "incremental absolution" and "searing reverie" are shoehorned into the text, disrupting the rhythm. The prose often leans into abstraction ("absolution wove itself") rather than concrete, sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant loop artifacts mar the prose, with the prompt phrase "velveteen gloom" repeated three times and "cobalt silo" four times in a short space. The reliance on adjective-heavy construction ("unlikely sanctuary," "profound sense") slows momentum without adding density. These repetitions read as scaffold rather than intentional motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and awkward prompt insertions ("innovation within a constraint," "sustaining transformation") that disrupt rhythm and clarity. There is a high ratio of telling to showing, with diagnostic language replacing concrete action. The phrasing feels mechanical, driven by a checklist rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is functional but relies heavily on "to be" verbs and abstract nouns, telling the reader what is happening rather than showing it through concrete imagery. There is a lack of sensory immediacy, with "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" appearing as ornamental descriptors that do not deepen the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is competent but laden with abstract nouns ("finalities," "illusions," "beauty") and slightly purple phrasing ("porcelain's embrace"). Several phrases ("weaving truth carefully," "somber marvel") feel like awkward insertions that disrupt the rhythm rather than enhancing the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant loop penalties apply due to the verbatim repetition of key phrases: "sedimentary layers" (x4), "competing narratives" (x3), "wannabe philosopher" (x3), and "agonize/ing" (x3). These artifacts create a mechanical rhythm that disrupts the prose flow and highlights the artificial insertion of required elements.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose relies heavily on abstraction and "telling," with prompt phrases shoehorned in awkwardly ("Across unlearning hatred," "traveled stillness audible"). These insertions disrupt syntax and logic, revealing the prompt scaffolding rather than integrating it into the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is hindered by "telling" constructions ("his informally wise nature showing") and stock phrasing ("gift and a burden"). Expository lumps stall momentum, particularly when defining the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically competent but thin, lacking density, distinct rhythm, or evocative imagery. The writing relies on telling ("words flowing out without her customary filter") and repetitive tags ("nectar dusk") rather than concrete, sensory-driven description.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant loop artifacts severely impact quality; "streetlights daydreamed" repeats three times, and "sanctify" and "shard of hush" also cycle frequently. The phrase "inadvertently profound" is inserted clumsily as a label ("The object was inadvertently profound") rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("incisively kind," "gentle insistence") and prompt-forced constructions like "thread the truth through the structural weakness." While the rhythm is generally smooth, the density of abstract nouns slows momentum and distances the reader from the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive looping of specific phrases ("balancedly daring," "texture of," "grim optimism") creates a distracting template cadence throughout the text. The climax relies on "semantic void" phrasing ("activated the final sequence... channeling its energy") that obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is marred by repetitive phrases ("smog-choked" x3, "moon-tipped brush" x3) and clichés ("vanished without a trace," "precious treasures"). The writing lacks density, relying on stock formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.2)
    Critical text artifact ("lined with决心") indicates a generation glitch that renders the text unpublishable as is. Phrasing is repetitive ("rosewater dread" x3, "historically oriented" x2), and the prose is dense with unearned modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    Required phrases are inserted clumsily (e.g., "neatly inventive adjustments"), creating rhythm breaks and repetitive echoes. The prose suffers from adjective stacking and cliché constructions ("surged through her veins") that reduce information density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but laden with abstract nouns and "telling" labels ("repulsive allure," "photographically cursed") instead of concrete imagery. Phrasing is often awkward to force prompt inclusion, particularly the clumsy use of "unbosom" as an imperative verb in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is functional but relies heavily on abstract nouns and clichéd phrasing ("symphony of existence," "ethereal blue glow"). There is a reliance on summary and telling over concrete, immediate action, which flattens the pacing during what should be the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("fading into madness," "spiderwebbing," "ancient evil," "since the world began"). The rhythm is repetitive, and the reliance on stock phrasing prevents the imagery from becoming vivid or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" over "showing," using adverbs ("cautiously," "meticulously," "carefully") to describe actions that should be dramatized. The repetition of the key phrase "noble lies" creates a redundant, droning effect that deadens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" and repetitive noun phrases (epithets). Abstract concepts ("interlaced absence") are treated as concrete objects without sensory grounding, and the sentence structure lacks variety in its declarative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe keyword stuffing degrades the prose; phrases like "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," and "reclaimed stillness" are repeated 3–4 times each, creating a robotic, looping cadence. This repetition acts as a major text artifact that obstructs flow and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("precision of a surgeon," "beacon of hope," "tears of relief") and abstract noun phrases that dull the imagery. Sentences frequently function as scaffolding to explain motivation ("His motivation was singular") rather than advancing the action through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("bleak exhilaration," "unfiltered awakening"), creating a stilted, scaffolded rhythm. Redundant phrasing ("geode crystal") and oxymorons used as crutches ("intangibly tangible") clutter the line-level clarity and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition of specific epithets ("perpetually surprised," "sharp-eyed," "brilliant dimness") creates a robotic, template-like cadence that ruins immersion. The prose suffers from high adjective density and scaffolded sentence structures that tell rather than show (e.g., "features tightened with intense concentration"). These artifacts signal a lack of line-level control and editing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("bile in his throat," "washing away layers") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases as labels ("tempered regret"). The repetition of "sieved hush" creates a distracting loop artifact that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from abstraction ("untether... years of resentments") and melodramatic phrasing ("furrowed hush," "hardened hearts"). The reliance on telling—explaining Lyra's nature and the object's significance—stalls momentum, and the repeated mantra acts as a scaffold that weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by mixed or clichéd metaphors ("anchor and albatross," "houses of cards") and filter verbs. The phrase "merrily melancholic" clashes tonally and feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant mechanical flaws include a subject-verb agreement error ("that newspapers was my map") and the forced repetition of the phrase "delicately robust" three times, which reads as a prompt-insertion artifact rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies on stock phrasing and cliché pairings ("ancient and new," "whispered like rustling leaves," "pools of night sky"). While readable, the density of abstract adjectives prevents the visceral imagery needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe text-artifact looping is present; the phrases "choking beauty," "willingly perplexed," and "lost time accumulates" each appear four times in a short space, creating a distracting, algorithmic rhythm. The prose lacks density, relying on filler words and abstract descriptors instead of active verbs and specific nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=2.8)
    Line-level craft is heavily impacted by prompt-pattern artifacts, specifically the verbatim repetition of "recycled spaceship" (5 times), "steadfast pacifist" (3 times), and "gravitationally lighter" (3 times) within a short text. This repetition creates a droning, artificial rhythm that breaks immersion. The prose relies on filter verbs and adjective stuffing ("spectral ghost," "reinforced portal") that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of stock phrases ("destitute philanthropist" x3, "slow dance of celestial bodies" x3, "vibrant hush" x3) creates a mechanical, looped effect. The prose is laden with abstract nouns ("invisible threads," "fabric of his being") and relies on telling rather than showing. Information density is low due to the reiteration of these static descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.5)
    A significant text artifact ("methods of联络") disrupts the prose, indicating a breakdown in line-level craft or editing. Additionally, the text relies heavily on loop artifacts, repeating full phrases like "bronze quill holder" and "vigilant lock sentinel" excessively (5+ times) instead of using pronouns or variations.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is readable but marred by logical inconsistencies (gripping without friction) and cliché phrasing (&quot;impossible colors,&quot; &quot;cosmic seams&quot;). The sentence rhythm is somewhat repetitive, often following a simple subject-verb-object pattern that fails to build momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of "X like Y" similes ("clouds... like suppressed words," "thunder... like distant censors," "pen scratching like claws") that clutter the imagery. The reliance on abstract metaphors over concrete details creates a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose leans toward purple description ("prismatic chaos," "unnerving precision") and suffers from clunky repetition of the full prompt phrase "Danish tin sewing needle card." These textual artifacts and the repetition of "dignified chaos" obstruct flow and feel like checklist insertions rather than organic language.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and capitalized abstractions ("Tomorrow's Garden," "Collapsed Literature") that distance the reader. The phrase "luminous fracture" is used twice to summarize the atmosphere, acting as a shortcut for description rather than evoking it through detail.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from clunky prompt insertions, most notably &quot;Working strategically and creatively,&quot; which tells rather than shows. The text relies on worn phrases (&quot;fingers danced,&quot; &quot;defying the logic of time&quot;) that dampen the narrative's immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("cast long shadows," "dissolving like mist," "thunderous roar," "chased away the shadows of doubt") and abstract descriptors. Reliance on filter verbs and "telling" reduces immediacy, and the rhythm is repetitive without purposeful variation to match the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe line-level issues include the distracting "RBG hands" typo and heavy reliance on adjective-adverb padding ("rhythmically placid," "gently," "wildly"). The insertion of prompt phrases is clumsy, disrupting the rhythm and logic of the sentences.

    Heavy paraphrase loops and verbatim repetition ("drawing parallels" x4, "burned love letter edge" x5+, "final bus departed the vacant station" x4) create template cadence, dulling propulsion and obscuring closure image; synonym churn in reflections wastes density.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies with ritual acceleration to peak silence; repetitive "peripheral awareness" (4x in consecration) and "strangely honest" create paraphrase loop dulling climax density.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Some paraphrase loops on vines/lavender and repetitive phrasing ("seemed to," "as [element]"); rhythmic variety good overall, but minor overwriting in descriptive beats dulls peak density without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; read-aloud ear strong in dawn progression. Motif repetitions ("fractured sequences," "weathered innocence") patterned but border paraphrase loops in reflective blocks, slightly dulling mid-section momentum without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies with short sensory bursts in peak beats, high density integrates action-image-reflection; exact phrase repetition ("arranging driftwood as directional markers" x3) creates minor template cadence loop dulling propulsion mid-story. No closure harm, metaphors coherent (fog tide, layered sighs).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density and rhythmic variety propel beats, but repeated "luminous ache" and "ephemeral" create minor overwrite loops in peak realization without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sunlight...casting a warm glow that felt both ancient and immediate"); purposeful motif recurrence (hush, moss) taught early, minor paraphrase loops in wound metaphors do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("lucidly watchful" x3, "against the current" x2, "ephemeral cameo appearances" x3) and metaphor density in every sentence dull propulsion; template cadence in reflections obscures closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action/image; minor paraphrase loops ("spun golden stories," arbor repeats) and figurative density in climax slightly dull propulsion. No artifacts obscure vine spin closure; strong verbs propel.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dense figurative overlays ("celestial carousel," "silt at the bottom," "bridge of words") in high-pressure bridge/approach beat obscure propulsion (-0.6); minor paraphrase loops ("shimmered," "shimmering" repetition). Density functional but risks overwriting at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density in action-integrated details, varied rhythm aids propulsion; metaphors coherent (stars, sleeping giants). Repetitive phrasing ("maze of intentions" x3, "stoic" variants) creates minor paraphrase loops without obscuring closure, but dulls some momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Repetitive phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle" x3, "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" x3, "glacial hush" echoes) creates paraphrase loops dulling mid-section momentum; some overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "distant stars... ancient secrets"). Closure image propels cleanly despite artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("errant legend seeker" thrice, "architecture of lies" recurrence) and synonym churn on truth/deception dull mid-reflection momentum (−0.6). Rhythm varies read-aloud; no filter stacks or template cadence in peak realization. Strategic telling compresses backstory effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Minor loops in "muffle" and snow repetition dull mid-density; rhythmic hush supports tone but paraphrase in fog/snow descriptors drags propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers traced the delicate weft thread" advances emotion/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("shadowed garden," "crimson weft") purposeful in pattern but slightly templated; no closure muddle or heavy artifacts. Varied syntax, strong verbs support ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density and propulsion, but minor loops ("hypothesizing" x4, "bitter sweet" reprise) and occasional overwriting in transformation spill dull peak slightly; rhythm varies, no major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Repetitive motif phrasing ("migration of clouds," "gracefully alert," "scars can sing") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling density in reflective beats; syntax varies but synonym churn on legacy reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Patterned repetition of "defiant hush" serves tone but risks loop; minor overwrite in "luminous skeptic questioning the shadows" jars slightly, though density propels to closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops in "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" (repeated 8+ times) and "calculating machine gear" create template cadence, dulling propulsion in transit beats. Figurative density overwrites without consistent payoff, obscuring peak momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with multi-job lines like "thundering calm" recurring purposefully; minor paraphrase loops in grief descriptors ("empty and overflowing," "individual sorrow and shared") dull peak slightly but don't obscure closure; rhythm varies read-aloud, no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with vivid propulsion in "Heat bled through his fingertips"; minor paraphrase loops on "balance" purposeful for theme, no closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density with propulsion: lines integrate setting/action (cobalt walls absorbing sound); no loops, varied rhythm, zero artifacts even in peak decoding. "Velveteen gloom" purposeful recurrence without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "predictive modeling"/"transformation" (e.g., repeated "predictive models had detected shifts... patterns none else could perceive") dull density across reflections; template cadence in "She had [past achievement]" stems. Closure image clear but artifacts touch final third. Propulsion varies but hedging in redundancies slows.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops in backstory (story famine silence, dust discovery) and heavy figurative layering (mist swirling, dust dancing) dull peak momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density, varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("mirage of safety" x3, "weaving truth carefully" x2, "incomplete information" x2) and synonym churn dull momentum, especially final third. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; propulsion strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loops on "sedimentary layers" (4+ repeats) and "competing narratives" create redundancy dulling propulsion; density strong otherwise, but template cadence in relic descriptions triggers −0.8 accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies with scene, but paraphrase loops on "expectantly resigned" and "harmony" reduce density in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vivid sensory propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in decay motifs ("ruins," "decay") and reflective stems slightly dull mid-section density. No closure artifacts; high info density in peak planting ("fingers tingling as the seed's consciousness connected"). Clean mechanics overall.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)

Minor template cadence in action stems.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density with vivid sensory propulsion, but −0.6 for paraphrase loops like repeated "lost voices/symbols" and "daydreams intensified" across middle beats dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Minor template cadence in sequential stroke descriptions; rhythm varies but closure image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Purposeful "rosewater dread" texture builds density without muddle, rhythmic thumping echoes resistance; minor descriptive swells purposeful in accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cold water that seeped through her trousers" advances setting/embodiment/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifacts: "bleak exhilaration" reprises twice without strong pattern payoff, and minor synonym churn in "defied... defiance" loops near climax (−0.4 applied here only); no closure dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion and density overall, but minor loops in "whispering advisor" (repeated 4x) and luminance phrasing dull some beats without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "obstacles into instruments" (repeated 4x) and synonym churn ("resonance," "vibrations," "tones," "euphony") dull mid-section propulsion; no closure touch.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, varying sentence openings propel from setup to closure without loops, though "patterns" recurrence purposeful for textural build. Minor scaffold in "sunwashed dread" repetition charges tone without dulling; no artifacts touch peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Repetitive phrasing loops ("noble lies," "recapture," "pit of lies") create paraphrase churn across middle beats, dulling density; some template cadence in discovery sentences (e.g., "matched... perfectly"); rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors like ivy clawing harms propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "submerged pavilion" and "antique traveling inkwell" (4+ mentions) create synonym churn dulling density in middle; figurative consistency (hushed blaze) propels but heavy in recovery beat. Rhythm varies well overall, no closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Repetitive phrasing ("readjust" x4, "tranquilly perceptive" x2, "dappled resolve" x2) creates template cadence loops across reflective beats, dulling propulsion without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with purposeful motif recurrence ("descends while ascending"); minor overwriting in gem descriptions but propulsion clear, no loops dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Repetitive "perpetually surprised" (x3) and "brilliant dimness" (x3) create minor paraphrase loops in descriptive beats, dulling density without full pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but elevated diction like "harmonic frequencies" clashes slightly in peak pull; propulsion solid overall.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sieved hush" motif taught early, propels atmosphere/causality); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops in peak discovery beat. Minor overwriting in reflective blocks (e.g., "burdened by truth") but purposeful, not obscuring closure image. Clean grammar, strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but −0.8 for paraphrase loops ("uncommonly thoughtful," "neutral territory," mantra) and synonym churn (mist/ghosts/fog) dulling mid-beats; no closure touch. Rhythm varies; strong verbs anchor images (whipped hair, pooled moonlight). Minor template cadence in reflection blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Repetitive phrasing loops ("clean slate seeker," "jaded wonder," "delicately robust") create paraphrase churn in reflective beats, dulling density; synonym cycles on empathy/past obscure propulsion. Rhythm varies but template stems like "I touched the baseball again" recur. Closure image clear despite artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid propulsion via sensory integration, but figurative density (eyes as "pools of night sky," breath glyphs) overwrites high-pressure transformation beat without full pattern payoff, dulling some immediacy; minor "whispers" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Refrain motifs ("choking beauty") teach pattern for accumulative payoff without loop drag; high density propels to closure, varied syntax matches emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Paraphrase loops in "recycled spaceship" (repeated 7x without new pressure) and "steadfast pacifist" create template cadence, dulling propulsion in opening third; rhythm varies but synonym churn on tears/sorrow drags density.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies with short peak sentences, but paraphrase loops ("vibrant hush"/"whispering hush" x6 total, "texture of transformation" x4) create mild redundancy dulling density in reflective beats. Figurative density overwrites alignment peak slightly without muddle. Propulsion strong overall, no scaffold in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies effectively, propulsion strong in painting sequence; high density integrates action/atmosphere. Minor artifacts: repetitive "winking hush"/"cradle of sparks" phrasing borders loop without obscuring closure (−0.4). No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peaks. Clean mechanics overall.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Repetitive abstraction loops ("sacred patterns," "mathematical sequence[s]," "patterns" x6) create patterned artifact (−0.9), dulling density around climax without payoff. Vivid propulsion overall, but overwriting in color metaphors and stone-placement templates ("The [ordinal] stone...") triggers −0.5 paraphrase check. Closure image clear despite slips.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    High density with vivid propulsion, but minor artifacts: paraphrase loops in timer "beeped softly... beeped again" and repetitive thunder/storm motifs dull peak writing beat (−0.6). Rhythms vary read-aloud; no filter stacks. Metaphors coherent ("lightning struck... bathing... in storm-kissed wonder").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with multi-job lines; purposeful repetition of motifs (tin, Elias) pattern-taught without loops obscuring closure. Minor figurative density in reflective beats but coherent; rhythm varies read-aloud, propelling to final image. No scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Varied rhythm and density propel from performance to climax without loops; opening figurative cluster ("danced... flowing... echoed... swayed") risks overwriting but integrates without dulling peak projector threading.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density weaves action/sensory without loops; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in song's resonance. Minor overwriting in orchid/monsoon descriptions slightly dulls cave climax.

    High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops in "tides of remembrance" repetitions and elevated diction slightly dull peak ritual propulsion.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and concept (“flood had receded… leaving… broken glass and wilting plants”) without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—dust as data, greenhouse as cathedral—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and cosmic/earth juxtaposition; final line resolves by image that recharges dust→spiral motif. Minor over-alliteration (“damp earth and decay”) is voice-motivated and forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet clear; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay within glass/light lexicon. Minor overwrite: “luminous glass artist known for her ethereal creations…” unpacks adjectives before we see the art, but it is single line. Closure line lands clean without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately; information density is moderate. Key flaw: near-duplicate phrasing across paragraphs (“unshaken marvels,” “crystalline silence,” “translate silence into music”) produces a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum; three such cycles trigger –0.6. Metaphors occasionally mix (“music in feelings” as heat waves) without payoff. No grammar errors, yet the cadence becomes hypnotic rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid template cadence. Mixed metaphors are few, but “weight of the ocean pressed in, a chased stillness” fuses tactile and abstract without clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One hedge cluster (“appeared empty, yet filled with whispers”) slightly dulls immediacy, yet artifacts never touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, no loops or synonym churn; sentences open varied, information dense—“Each bundle contained just enough for a family to share” does world, stakes, and history in one line. Figurative language is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “they’ve tightened restrictions… They will need more support” restates scarcity twice—acceptable at 700 words but keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    Figurative layering is dense—every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (light, breath, bloom) and sustains coherence. Occasional abstractions (“the air breathed with foggy lucidity”) trade precision for mood. No scaffold loops or synonym churn, yet several sentences could lose 2–3 words without damage. Final paragraph slips into explanatory mode that dulls the last image’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, looping only minor phrases (“the halo fragment” x3); figurative language is selective and tied to pulse/breathing motifs. One mixed metaphor—“consciousness floated through disconnected scenes like fading photographs”—is forgivable. No scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks; momentum stays fluid through surreal beats, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varied; openings avoid monotony. High information density: one line seeds future, reveals past, grounds place. Minor scaffold: “staggering grace” repeated thrice without escalation; “dry soil” trope appears four times. Metaphors coherent (vault as womb, arrow as compass). No artifacts in closure beat; typo-free. Could trim adjectives (“clandestine,” “iridescent”) for tighter compression.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Most sentences carry dual duty—sound, color, emotion—yet occasional modifier stacks (“battered marvel of existence”) flirt with purple; no paraphrase loops, but the phrase “while cells divided” is repeated four times, creating a faint template cadence that dulls the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud ear: syntax varies, no template cadence. Density is high—single sentences layer light, color, and motive. Figurative language is restrained until peak beat, then “liquid silver light” is apt, not mixed. One scaffold loop: “golden-hour portrait thief” phrase repeated three times; costs −0.2 but never touches closure. Otherwise scaffolding cut, momentum sustained. A single typo-free, clean proof.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive, sentences doing double duty (sensorial + metaphoric) with only occasional paraphrase loops (“during ice melting” repeated). Figurative layering is pattern-taught early and pays off in the prismatic finale, but the narrated declarations sometimes over-explain the metaphor already rendered, creating micro-scaffold that dulls immediacy by ~10%.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is mostly crisp: information-dense lines (“phosphorescent glow…made faint writing slightly easier”) do double duty. One paraphrase loop: “heart pounding…heart-pounding fear” recycles same beat. Metaphors stay coherent (stars as witness, shell as maternal voice). No simultaneity errors; tense stable. Final clause “unbroken” nicely inverts seashell’s earlier fragility, showing micro-level turnaround rather than tell.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense, almost every sentence layered (“gold leaf booklet trembled… gentle light emanating from her sketches”). Occasional metaphor stacking (“architecture of darkness,” “veins of different minerals”) but never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, high-density, mostly loop-free; only micro-churn “the frozen courtyard seemed…” repeats “seemed” twice in three sentences. Metaphors are coherent: processor expansion, crystal lattice as mind. Rhythm breathes—long twilight sentences vs staccato “it scraped a synthetic bow.” No scaffold artifacts in closure beat. One simultaneity hiccup: “As twilight deepened, Unit 347 extended a hand…” implies hand moves while light changes, a trivial timing blur.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; paragraph lengths breathe. Some modifier stacks (“lingering notes of music and scattered concert tickets, some bearing cryptic doodles”) dilute impact. No scaffold loops, but “crystal whispering forecourt” recurs enough to feel incantatory rather than urgent. Mixed-metaphor risk in “ambiguously clear” is acknowledged and thematic, not accidental. Generally clean; density slips in descriptive lulls rather than high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmic yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative language is sparse and purposive—glass cracks “resembling the flower’s petals”—never overwrought. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image, character, or theme. One minor filter-stack (“he would polish, he would place…”) in the third paragraph is voice-motivated ritual cadence, forgiven under read-aloud ear test. Copy is clean: tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Her fingers, mechanically warm from years of interfacing…danced across the console” fuses backstory, body, and action. Figurative language is sparse, avoids purple streaks. No mixed metaphors; “shimmering distortion” is physically coherent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop detected: “subdued awakenings” is restated twice without new pressure, but it does not touch the closure beat. Opening and closing lines are crisp, image-based. Proofing is clean; no typos or pronoun drift. Information density is high; no scaffold sentences. Overall, line craft is publishable with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density without purple overload: “water damage had created peculiar images” packs cause and visual in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—water-stars, pearl-keys—anchored to physical logic. Minor tic: “flickering lanterns” repeats twice; does not dull closure but keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from compressed scientific list to lyrical elongation without pattern fatigue. Information density high: “temperatures raged inside his body while outside, the thermometer recorded plummeting mercury” twins micro & macro in one line. No scaffold or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (ink as map, sorrow as condensation). One over-crank: “subcutaneous map drawn not in ink but in sorrow” risks abstraction, yet the next sentence grounds it in cave legend, preserving clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid, rhythm varied; occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized final image”) drifts above POV lexicon but never obscures. No loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often does two jobs. Metaphors clean, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—each sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or emotional work. Metaphors are coherent (ink on wet parchment, solidified honey) and never mixed. Opening and final lines are sharp bookends. No filter-verb clusters or register drift. One hairline slip: “smooth, dark walls absorbing” repeats the absorptive motif in adjacent phrases; minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences carry double duty (atmosphere + world-rule). Figurative language is spare and consistent—no mixed metaphors. The repeated noun phrase “bronze quiet” functions as litany, not scaffold, but still creates a slight audible loop. Otherwise, cadence breathes with the historian’s steps, and paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is fluid yet loops: “hidden in plain sight” variants appear four times; “meanings embedded within” echoes. Metaphors mix tides, music, and light without pattern. Read-aloud rhythm is pleasant but repetitive, diluting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: most sentences advance chant layer, glyph stroke, or entity reaction simultaneously. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (sound = architecture, silence = fabric). One mixed comparison—“muffled clarity”—is intentional, thematic, not accidental. Rhythm breathes with ritual escalation; final paragraph slows into resonant hush without momentum drop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory memory, stakes, and metaphor without scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; “memories flowed like water” appears once and is justified. Mixed metaphor check: spiral shell / frozen lake horizon maintains optical logic, no clash. One filter-verb cluster (“he could feel”) appears but falls outside final third; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose propels: most sentences do image + motion + interior triage. Occasional elevated phrasing (“periodically eternal”) fits inscription register and is justified by tablet POV. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; spatial and causal clarity remains intact. Figurative language compressed to 2–3 metaphors, all paid off (“fractured timelines like shattering glass” culminates in audible fracture).

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template beats. Sentences often double-duty: “Eleanor traced the rim of an old drum, her fingers remembering rhythms her ears could no longer detect” anchors object, backstory, and stakes in one sweep. Occasional soft scaffolding—“Each day, Eleanor returned”—but momentum recovers. Mixed metaphors avoided; “mirrored hush” recurs with accruing rather than stale weight. No line-level artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty. Occasional elevated phrasing (“layered tranquility that covered secrets both personal and political”) edges toward abstraction but does not clot momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence. Density is high—“echoes in chlorophyll / echoes in aroma” compresses world-memory symmetry in four words. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent: no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Only hairline slip: “transformation completing now” gerund stack, but momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths shorten under knot-tying urgency. Figurative layer is dense (≈70% of sentences) but pattern-taught and paid off in final mandala image—density penalty waived. No synonym loops or template cadence; strong verbs (“traced,” “pulsed,” “rippled”) replace modifiers. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “seemed to” filters could compress, but do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clean: concrete nouns, active verbs, no filter stacks. Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. A few semi-abstract pairings (“chronic hush that settled deep in the bones of the land”) flirt with mixed metaphor but remain legible. Near-duplicate openings—“The rainforest had burned…” / “The rainforest burned…” —create mild template cadence; not severe enough to dull closure, so held above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances image or beat. One scaffold loop—“counterfeit emotion” repeated three times in four lines—dulls momentum mid-page. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase echoes keep it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean, but four “whimsically attentive”–stem sentences in one paragraph create template cadence; mild loop. Mixed-metaphor risk (“composition of human connection”) but ships/music overlap is intentional. High information density; no scaffold bloat. Final-line parallelism is earned. Minor artifact keeps out of 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence can stage, characterize, and foreshadow—“her fingertips coaxing spirals...where the crystalline orchard perched.” No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language peaks at “kurrajong seed pod fused with a spider’s web” yet remains legible and motivates Mira’s recognition. Minor scaffold: “luminescent ache” repeated twice could be trimmed once, but repetition serves cadence, not padding; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythm varied, high noun specificity (“crystal-like patterns,” “canyons between towers”). Minor template cadence in “he” opener clusters and a few stacked metaphors (“echoes are born,” “cadence that should have been flowing… like a heartbeat”) keep it from the 9-band; no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between stalactite drip cadence (short, liquid clauses) and ritual incantation (long, accumulative stacks); no template cadence detected. Metaphors are geologically consistent—water, stone, light—avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “buried optimism” is named twice without fresh embodiment; minor. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, magical rule, and emotional valence. Closure line crystallizes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is evocative but leans on poetic pairing stacks (“kindly methodical grace,” “perfect sapphire hush”) that border purple in a 700-word space. Several near-repeats: “fragment felt warm despite coolness,” “kindly methodical” thrice. No mixed metaphors, but density edges high without payoff at closure. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle paragraphs sag into gentle paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with different parts of speech; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse, deployed only when it advances image (“wood surface softened and darkened”). High information density: single sentence often layers weather, plant reaction, and Elara’s counter-move. No synonym loops or scaffolding. Final line lands with satisfying sonic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often does setting-emotion-symbol work. A few mixed metaphors (“piece of unearthed convergence”) flirt with abstraction but are saved by tactile context. No scaffold loops; final-line reprise of “thresh meaning” is deliberate callback, not churn. Word-choice precise: “pigment” vs. “color,” “trembling” vs. “shaking.”

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“crystalline flowers in the bright darkness”—and never muddled. Information density is high: each sentence advances image, pressure, or knowledge. One scaffold trace: “overlapping shadows” is repeated four times in close proximity; the slight loop nicks 0.2 but does not dull the closure image. No typos, tense drift, or buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences are dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative layer is restrained to weather-light, trumpet-gleam, tapestry. High information ratio—each line advances catalog, vision, or communal stakes—without scaffolding or mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences carry dual duty—image plus emotional charge (“the object integrating with his hand, becoming part of him while remaining separate”)—with natural rhythm variation. Minor template cadence in “Each step forward was a dare…” trio, but it echoes ritual progression, hence tolerated. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Scaffolding is light: one paraphrase loop (“analytically artistic mind” repeated) costs −0.2, keeping score sub-7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid yet occasionally loops: “Through forgotten patterns” is repeated four times with minimal re-inflection; each could carry new sensorium but doesn’t. No mixed metaphors, but scaffold phrases (“quiet revelation,” “spaces in between”) dull immediacy. Clarity remains high; momentum never stalls fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density. Occasional elevated register (“prismatic escondite,” “conceptual equation”) stays justified by immortal POV. One paraphrase loop: “not merely cursed but was a key” essentially restates prior clause; minor −0.2. No mixed metaphors, no filter stacks, no scaffold loops. Clean grammar, clear sequencing, and tactile specificity (“layers of dust in the escondite’s deepest corner”) keep momentum alive to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, no loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances goal or texture. Strong verbs (“yielded,” “dialed,” “charged”) and concrete nouns (“embalming tables,” “silver surface”). One mixed metaphor—“liquid thoughts” beside “mathematics”—but it doesn’t blur causality. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the breach, then exhales at the return of the pot.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: “His fingers, stained with the finest gold leaf that gave him his trade name, reverently handled the pages” seeds occupation, sensory detail, and world rule in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors stay physically coherent—lamps hum, gold seals, bonsai paths tangle—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: long breathless clause builds to the snap of three notation marks. Proofing is clean; no typos, pronoun drift, or tense wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, metaphor, and plot advance (“I layer tales overheard in alleyways … rebuilding myself story by story”). No paraphrase loops; each container pass adds new acoustic or tactile fragment. Metaphors stay logically coherent—tide / palimpsest / label fade all reinforce dissolution motif. Minor scaffold: occasional prepositional chime (“across the rhythm of tides” repeated) but never near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are kept singular per beat (“miniature galaxies,” “whisper of closing pages”) and do not stack into purple. Opening and closing lines serve as rhythmic parentheses. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she noticed,” “she realized”) appear but not in peak beats; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs (“clutched,” “slipped,” “nailed”) keep momentum. Information density high: one sentence can set place, stake, sensory clash. One mixed-metaphor watch-spot—“splash of cold water” revelation amid salt-air carnival—reads intentional, not slip. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; final-line spiral/circle image concise, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lines are dense: “The dawning hush intensified as the horizon began to lighten” marries atmosphere, timer, and camera prep in one sweep. No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors (“weight…like a shroud”) are singular and earned. Filter verbs avoided; strong verbs (“adjusted,” “scanned,” “raised”) propel action. Minor over-modification in “quiet anticipation, a melancholy” is local and does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer tool, body, and emotional charge—“His fingers traced…feeling the micro-fractures…as if reading braille.” Figurative language is sparse and earned; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Micro-loop check clean: no repetitive stems or synonym churn. Final paragraph contains one template cadence (“once again settled into its magnetic calm”) but does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and information-dense; sentences often double-duty (sound of pen echoes isolation). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is spare—condensation as delta, wind as whisper—kept in POV filter. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif. One micro-slip: “worrying tranquility” is repeated verbatim, could vary cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are sparse, acoustic, coherent. One mixed image—“bruised sky”—is minor. High information density; each sentence advances repair or resonance. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose propels: varied cadence, strong verbs, high information density. One paraphrase loop (“finality… finality”) and one mixed metaphor (“descending angels”) dull the finish slightly, keeping the score south of 8.8. Otherwise clean grammar, coherent spatial tracking, no scaffold bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    High-density imagery (“copperlight repose,” “ghosts refusing to be exorcised”) remains purposeful; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops; scaffolding is minimal, though occasional stacked modifiers approach overwriting—density penalty held to −0.3 because closure image stays clear and propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clean, with high information density; sentences weave sensory detail into action. Minor scaffold: “resonant awakenings” is reused four times without new pressure, creating a small loop; mixed metaphor “lovingly venomous pollen” is accepted as voice-driven. No artifacts obscure the closure image; final lines are crisp and image-based. Occasional elevated diction (“attuned celestial conditions”) fits the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor (tide serpents, dragon spines) advances the textile-canyon fusion; no mixed vehicles. Occasional template stems (“The…”) appear in openings yet serve litany rhythm rather than scaffolding. Information density high; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors (“grotesque yet beautiful dance,” “broken communion”) and both serve the tone of cautious enchantment without crowding. One paraphrase loop detected: “journey completed / path rediscovered” in adjacent sentences, a −0.2 loop penalty. No grammar slips; pronouns stay anchored. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, and free of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but three successive “She…then she…” templates in paragraph 4 create a mild cadence loop (−0.3). Figurative language is dense in the final paragraph (“bridge between two souls,” “eternal dance”); because pattern was not established early, it edges toward overwriting (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure. Information density is high; most sentences fold setting + interiority. Minor scaffolding: “something almost sacred” hedges where concrete sensation would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory density with mixed-metaphor vigilance (“windows catching dying light like prismatic tears” edges to stacked image). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths vary; no template cadence runs. One paraphrase loop: “whispers swirled… echoed silence” twice invokes quiet without new pressure. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“stitched,” “swelled”) propel. Closure line is clean, foregoing explanatory clutter. Artifacts present but do not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She listened to the haunting melodies… their harmonies speaking of unsent letters” layers sound, metaphor, and theme in one stroke. No synonym loops; modifiers are sparse and specific (“inky,” “twisted”). Rhythm breathes—long liquid clauses for ghost songs, staccato fragments for condensation forming. Only micro-slip: “the space between them had been bridged” abstracts what we already see, but line does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with escalating beats: long sensory sentences early, then clipped final whisper. No synonym loops; “mist-clad,” “lotus-hearted,” and “unknot” are purposeful coinages that repay at closure. Information density high—each sentence advances character, image, or stake. One mixed metaphor (“curtain of twilight descending through…glass ceiling”) is momentary but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary from long breathy cadences (fog description) to staccato lamp adjustments; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is disciplined—each metaphor is visual and necessary (“colors…like liquid dawn” justifies her profession). Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence adds either historical or emotional information. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; final line resolves by image that re-illuminates earlier motif.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive—sentence variety and sensory density keep momentum—but three adjacent “pause between question and reply” refrains create template cadence; the figurative layering never collapses into mixed metaphor, but the repetition dulls the final third enough to block the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence can deliver tax law, botany, and stakes—“night-blooming cereus… signaling nationwide resistance.” Metaphors stay coherent (storm≈raid, aphids≈surveillance) and pay off. No loops, no scaffold, no purple patches. Minor simultaneity glitch in “shaken above chrysanthemums” while message travels underground—acceptable poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only two adjacent sentences near the middle re-state the postcard’s journey with near-paraphrase (−0.2). Figurative language is patterned and purposeful: each bloom “swells” only after a lullaby, so metaphor obeys causal logic. Information density is high—every sentence adds texture or advances the bloom sequence. Closure line is uncluttered, letting the shell’s hum land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong opening sentence hooks voice and stakes; most sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). Minor loop: “each day, fewer sounds remained…melodies evaporated like dew on glass orchids” restates vanishing under two metaphors. No mixed vehicles; figurative density stays just under the high-pressure threshold. A few filter-verb clusters (“Eleth’s heart clenched with…”) dull immediacy but do not stall climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is textured and compressed: “dust motes dancing in the afternoon light” does triple sensory work. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. However, a template cadence recurs: “The glass ink well…” opens three sentences across the piece; while pattern-teaching, the third iteration borders litany without fresh pressure. A few adjective clusters (“cautious exuberance,” “terrifying speed”) are stock pairings; they dull rather than sharpen. Closure beat is clean, so −0.3 for cadence repetition, −0.2 for stock intensifiers; total −0.5, yielding 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong density—most sentences do two jobs (action + metaphor). Occasional modifier stacks (“dappled resolve,” “tremulous confidence”) flirt with purple but pattern is taught early and holds. No loops, no scaffold, clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm modulates well; sentence variety supports the accrual of pattern. Figurative layering is dense—multiple paper/trail metaphors—but consistent and taught early, so density penalty waived. No loops or scaffold detected. Opening and closing lines are sharp; middle contains two near-paraphrase moments (“patterns that spoke of journeys…”, “guidance system that led her back”) that dull momentum slightly. Clean mechanics; pronouns stable.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“The necessary distances…”) repeats concept without new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within prism-terrace physics; no mixed vehicles. High information density achieved via compressed participial phrases that layer sight, sound, and memory. One filter-verb cluster (“had become,” “had begun”) softens urgency but does not stall the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but borderline overwritten: three stacked modifiers (“shadowseam wonder that filled each room”) and mixed metaphors (“stillness of the deep” vs. “dancing patterns”) appear in high-pressure beats. Repetitive clause openers (“Her softly ingenious mind…”) create template cadence; “softly ingenious” recycles four times. Information density is high—each sentence layers chart-memory, architecture, emotion—but some scaffolding could be trimmed (“as twilight painted the surface with deep blues”). No loops in final third; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    Metaphor density is high but patterned early; mixed vehicles rare. Rhythm breathes with paragraph shape. Scaffold: intrusive "before memory fades" refrain becomes loop; seed-scatter details repeat without new information, softening propulsion near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm alternates between long reflective sentences and crisp micro-actions, sustaining momentum. Figurative language is controlled: no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. One paraphrase loop—“orchestrated serendipity” restated three times—dings −0.2. Otherwise clean scaffolding, precise verbs, and sensory economy. Closure image (“stars…conspirators”) is concise and charged, keeping the score in high-7 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence length varies to match breath of dance vs. stillness. High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—e.g., “moonstone cabochon dust speck, barely visible…pulsing with inner light” locates object and charges it. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (tide, star, ink). Minor scaffold: “the nostalgia ban” is named three times in close succession—could compress once without loss. Closure sentence is clean, propulsive, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: sensory detail carries double duty for atmosphere and thematic refraction. Metaphors stay coherent (light-through-glass). A few soft loops—“between the…” triplets and “countless days” echo—but none obscure causality or dull closure image. Peak beat avoids purple overload; rhythm breathes with dawn pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “cracked porcelain box, cool and heavy… pressed like a silent accusation” does three jobs in one line. Metaphor chain (porcelain vein / burnt paper / granite grief) stays coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “slow dance of celestial bodies” appears twice but second use reweights meaning, so waived. Final line cadence mirrors star wheel, earns musical close.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical templates. Some near-paraphrase pairs (“creating patterns with decorations… each decoration represented a variable”) but not adjacent, so loops are minor. Occasional elevated register (“с новой науки”) feels unmotivated; otherwise clarity is high. No mixed metaphors; props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; minor scaffold appears (“she realized with a thrill,” “she recognized the weight”) but does not stall momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; syntax varies. A single filter-verb cluster in the lab paragraph keeps the score shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphor strings serve texture rather than overcrowd. Occasional soft nominalizations (“perceptively calm demeanor”) dilute immediacy. No loops or template cadence; sentence variety supports inhalation/exhalation of bell sequence. One mixed metaphor—“borrowed heartbeat quickened as she witnessed”—minor, not closure-adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and accurate. No scaffold loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“impossible beauty,” “eternal territories”) edges toward the generic but never muddies causality or blurs the closing image. A few syllables of compression would earn 9.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high information density (“engineered the drought,” “acquired through dubious channels,” “whispered words he’d learned”). Metaphors stay coherent (salt = ledger, rain = absolution). No scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric cadence in opening, staccato rain-drop beats at close. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—yet patterns are taught early and do not obscure causality (accumulative design). Mixed metaphors appear: “threads” are simultaneously fate, breath, and literal silver, but the piece is dream-logic, so inconsistency reads intentional. Paraphrase loops are frequent (“she had preserved…”) but short; they dull momentum, not clarity. Closure image is not muddied, so penalty stays mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative phrases (“meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphany”) recur but serve pattern, not clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“urbane,” “subversive”) fits character; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands with imagistic punch, propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between panoramic inhalations and knot-by-knot micro-beats; no template cadence. Figurative density high yet coherent—mixed metaphor risk averted because vehicles (tapestry, chorus, constellation) all serve pattern/memory motif. No synonym loops; “cloud-touched” recurs only twice, spaced, with functional purpose. One buried lead: “ancient stone marker” appears suddenly mid-story—minor clarity wrinkle but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between short breath-cloud bursts and longer braided clauses that mimic rope structure; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Information density is high—each sentence layers cold, light, and pattern without padding. One mixed metaphor: “time stretching around her like the rope” momentarily conflates duration and cord, but clarity recovers. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, satisfying the ear-test.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythms vary; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as mental turbulence, seal as instrument—without self-contradiction. High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory data, back-fragment, and future echo. One scaffoldish moment: “decaying directive etched…words fading…meaning becoming increasingly obscure” triple-states the same fact; minor −0.2, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies; clauses telescope from stately to staccato as tile activates. Mixed metaphors avoided. One paraphrase loop: “encrypted devotion” repeated twice within three lines subtracts 0.2. Dense information per sentence; no filler. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; no template runs. Figurative layering is high but purposeful—mirrors, frost, starlight interlace to create glass-mountain texture without mixed-metaphor clashes. One paraphrase loop (“centuries of thick fog” / “centuries of fog”) minor. Information density strong; each sentence advances image or breath-sync.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally varied sentence rhythm and selective detail, yet sporadic paraphrase loops ("brightened disquiet" twice, "simple yet complicated" variants) and stacked cosmic metaphors in the climax dull immediacy; clarity holds but the density flirtation keeps the prose from full propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—“pressed flora from extinct epochs and notes in seventeen forgotten dialects that referenced gaps”—does triple duty: world, object, stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent (ink-garden). A single mixed metaphor—“mountainous form breathing as if in response to the unheard symphony”—is minor. No artifacts in the closure beat; prop and spatial tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—and while most cohere, mixed vehicles (“tightrope of memory wound around consciousness”) risk abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but overwriting in peak beat dulls the closure image; thinning one descriptor every three sentences would restore propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often layers tool, action, and temporal rule. No scaffold loops; metaphor count stays low and functional. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“crystallised,” “conceptualised”) nudges register above Eleanor’s observable lexicon, but infrequent enough to keep clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and mostly loop-free; information density is high with few scaffold sentences. Mixed metaphors are avoided, but stacked modifiers (“gentle luminosity,” “profound quiet”) recur without fresh inflection. The climactic conjuring beat is overwritten: three consecutive sentences open with “The stone…” creating template cadence that dulls propulsion. Otherwise, grammar and sequence are clean, and the read-aloud rhythm supports the sonic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable; metaphors (“glass sang with the wind”) stay physically coherent. One scaffold phrase (“Day after day”) is allowed as accumulative pattern. No synonym churn or mixed-metaphor muddle. Final paragraph avoids explain-everything; ends on image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and information without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “solidified fog” stays physically coherent. One paraphrase loop—“the deepening hush was complete now” immediately after “the deepening hush”—triggers −0.2. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“glistened,” “converged,” “pierce”) carry motion. Final line recharges the motif of hush without redundant adjectives, earning the high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is purposeful; figurative layering is high but patterned (night-blooming cereus, moonflowers, starless void) and pays off in the final glow. One scaffold loop: “serious playfulness” is asserted twice without new embodiment. No mixed metaphors or register drift; information density strong. Artifact-free in final third; eligible for 9+ in other categories remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences layer ancestral memory, lunar chemistry, and funding crisis. No loops; “tidal pool” repeated only when image gains new semantic weight. Figurative control sustained—metaphors of metamorphosis stay inside entomological lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm rises in final paragraph, matching revelation tempo without breathless clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm modulates with altitude; sentences breathe at height, tighten underground. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; only one mixed metaphor (“seedling about to sprout toward the nourishing light”) is minor. Information density is high—each line advances image, stake, or interiority. Final line is crisp and recharging.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long floating sentences mirroring drift and crisp fragments for prism clicks. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor pile-ups obscure causality. Information density high: one sentence often embeds sensory cue, emotional shift, and world rule. Only micro-loop is the repeated “train whistle…vaulting hush” pair, but it is pattern-taught early and pays off in closure, hence exempt from penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is clean: no mixed metaphor, no scaffold loops, high information density. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) lightly drifts from Elara’s earthy POV, and two adjacent “ruby flake” noun repeats create micro-churn. Artifacts stay clear of closure beat, allowing 7.8 within high-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm: three-beat knock sequence creates ceremonial cadence; paragraph breath mirrors her sweeping then decisive rise. Information-dense lines (“ashes turned to ash” compresses memory, loss, medium). Metaphors stay coherent (threshold = starlight + sorrow). Zero loops; no scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is evocative and mostly propulsive; sentences layer job triplets (sense + metaphor + plot cue). A few scaffold phrases (“glowed with unnatural intensity… glowed with unnatural intensity” echo) and stacked modifiers (“eerie shadows that seemed to move on their own”) create momentary loop/ overwriting drag. No mixed metaphors, no artifacts in closure beat; clarity intact. Tightened trimming would lift rhythm into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, but metaphor density is high (“golden shadows danced,” “warm fingers,” “bridge of intuition”) and some phrasing loops (“stood...as the first yawn of evening stretched,” “eloquently silent” echoed thrice). No mixed metaphors, yet cumulative ornament slightly dilutes the decisive vibration beat. Pronoun and spatial tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from longer, liquid openings to clipped fragments at the unsnap moment, propelling the beat. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “sound like a lock releasing” is precise. One paraphrase loop detected (“impossible colors…colors speaking a language”) but it is two beats apart and does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line momentum is strong: most sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere without scaffold. Minor loop—“lagoon” repeated three times in five lines—dulls without pattern payoff. One garbled Cyrillic fragment mid-climax is an outright typo, not stylized voice, jarring clarity. Otherwise concision and varied sentence openings keep propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and sonorous; sentence variety supports the musical subject. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay compatible (light = sound = dew). Information density is high—each sentence advances image, motive, or acoustic effect. A few decorative adjectives (“radiant,” “eerie”) could be trimmed, but they do not stall momentum or obscure causality. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with Elara’s sorting tempo; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density is high—“moonstone cabochon dust speck” packs mineral taxonomy and folklore in five words. Figurative control avoids mixed metaphors; arbor as “slumbering beast” appears once and recedes. A lone filter-verb cluster (“seemed to contain”) is minor enough to keep 9+ within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence either advances location, tool-conversion, or emotional shift. No filler “he could see” filters; metaphor is spare (“shadow that followed him”) and consistent. Rhythm modulates from staccato ticking clauses to flowing waterfall sentences, mirroring theme. One micro-loop spotted—“clocks that ticked… each one a puzzle”—but it occurs early, low-pressure, and does not touch closure; artifacts otherwise absent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates fluidly; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and metallurgic ("steam rising like a ghostly sigh" is the single overt simile). High information density: each sentence advances furnace state, emotional shift, or ritual step. Minor −0.2 for two near-adjacent "rain-washed" usages, but repetition is thematically taught and reappears in closure, so artifact does not obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; information density high (one sentence can set, characterize, and foreshadow). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffolding: “heavy with whispered regrets” and “laden with purpose” sit adjacently—near-restate—but they occupy separate conceptual domains, so penalty stays at −0.2, leaving room above 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract under somatic shock. Metaphors are coherent—“inhaling shards of glass” sustains tactile continuity. One paraphrase loop: “the forest seemed to respond… seemed to lean closer” could compress, but it occupies a single beat and doesn’t obscure causality. Information density high; each line layers sensory, emotional, or conceptual payload. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is image-dense yet propulsive; sentences layer memory, object, and concept without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—lens as “anchor of intuition” remains physical and conceptual. One paraphrase loop: “elusively tangible” reprised four times in 700 words; trims 0.3. Opening and closing lines bookend with tidal echo, satisfying ear. No grammar slips; pronoun time-line clean across childhood-to-now compression.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: dust vial, mainspring lore, and ghost mechanics packed into single sentences without scaffold. Figurative control: “wisps of spiritual energy leaked like steam” stays physical and consistent. Minor loop: “weightless burden” phrase repeated thrice; pattern is taught early and reprised at closure, so waived as motif, not artifact. Closure line “answers…whispered from above” lands clean, no mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea (“burnished sorrow of their shared history”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing” territory) is earned by the baroque lens and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing, yet metaphor density is high in every sentence of the climax (“spark of reclaimed light,” “dawn chasing away night”) without pattern payoff. Filter-verb clusters (“Elias felt,” “he realized”) dull immediacy. No loops or contradictory vehicles, but cumulative ornament obscures the exact moment of success.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths contract in tunnel darkness. No loops or scaffold; “hinged awakening” appears thrice but each reweights meaning. Metaphors (obsidian, bone-voice) coherent under earth/water schema. Info-dense: one line packs archive, auction, psychometry. Minor elevated diction justified by collector-intellectual POV.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense—each sentence carries image or choice. No loops, paraphrase churn, or mixed metaphors. One minor overwrite: “hypnotic backdrop to her thoughts” edges toward cliché, but it is isolated and does not dull closure. Opening line anchors stakes and voice simultaneously; final line offers Charged Poise. Mechanics flawless; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphors are coherent (glass → petals) without mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information density high. One paraphrase loop—“dawning hush” repeated in first and last paragraphs—reads as intentional reprise, not artifact. Closure image is crisp; no figurative muddle touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no scaffold loops, no metaphor tangles, no register drift; each paragraph advances premise or stakes, and the final line lands with echoing brevity that satisfies the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative coherence: vortex as “inverted tree” sustains arboreal motif without mixed metaphor. Rhythm breathes—long accumulative clauses build spiral, then fragment at climax: “For a breathless moment, nothing happened—” High density: one sentence layers frost, starlight, seed jars, and POV bias. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy stays intact even in abstract final line because it follows a concrete gesture (hand trembling).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is mostly spare and propulsive; only occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial alignment,” “conceptual repricing of noise”) edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. Final bell-sentence is clean, single image. Had the overwriting touched the closure beat, the cap would bite; here it merely grazes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and largely loop-free; however, repeated abstract noun phrases (“flourishing stillness,” “cosmic consciousness,” “eternal dance”) create template cadence clusters that dull the final beat. One mixed-language typo (“痕迹”) breaks immersion. No strained metaphors or simultaneity errors. Density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight, but the emotional peak is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, backstory, and metaphoric charge without scaffold. No loops, near-duplicates, or mixed metaphors. “Smoke in the desert wind” risks cliché but is earned by prior hive-burn context. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes earned stasis. Minor elevation of diction (“transcended mere pollination”) slightly exceeds recluse lexicon, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and openers; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—time as tapestry, messages as leaking water—without mixed-vehicle collisions. One clause (“the texture of time passing was no longer a mystery but a comfort, a guide, and a friend”) borders on sentimental list-making, but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image. Information density is high; every paragraph adds pattern or new artefact data, sustaining momentum across the compact span.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    Strong forward pull for half the piece, then recycled phrases (“living stone pillars,” “architectural secrets”) loop without new pressure. Density drops into summary during months 4-5, dulling the pre-climax escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Some scaffold—“The rainwashed tower…,” “The bronze quiet…”—creates looping anaphora that slows momentum without deepening pattern. Mixed metaphors (“celestial confetti,” “whispered invitations from his own future”) are decorative, not muddled; they stay clear of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm mirrors the act: longer clauses while carriage creaks, then single-clause seed-bursts—“scattered the first handful”—creating an auditory sowing. Figurative control is tight: no mixed metaphors, only one stock phrase (“dying sun”). Information density is high; each sentence layers time, ecology, and myth without scaffolding. The single loop risk—“blooming jetty” repeated four times—earns its keep by becoming the closure’s echo, so the cadence functions as incantation rather than filler.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He could almost smell her on the wind, tinted revelations guiding him” advances plot + maintains motif. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“swept,” “reforged,” “charged”). Figurative language is sparse, avoids mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines bookend “wild hush” without repetition fatigue. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or sensory tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory, and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Figurative language is sparse but precise—“ghosts of past discoveries”—and avoids purple inflation. Closure line is clean, no artifact; readability under compression is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—movement, temperature, and symbolism interwoven with low redundancy. Opening line hooks stakes and voice; closing line returns to wonder, completing a tidy arc. Metaphors stay coherent (sky as fractured game board). One paraphrase loop—“each step bringing him closer…” repeats conceptually in adjacent clauses; minor. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally precise, but sporadic abstract clusters (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”) verge on purple when stacked; no loops stall momentum, yet one mixed metaphor (“penumbra swirled hungrily”) slightly blurs physical logic at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional adjective stacks (“labyrinthine corridors of bookstore that stretched deep within the ancient mountain”) slightly dilute momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat, keeping the final image crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no algorithmic stem repetition. Metaphors stay coherent within the light/refraction family, avoiding mixed-vehicle clutter. One scaffold loop: “echoes... echoes... echoes” triplet in closing paragraph could lose one instance without loss. Otherwise high density—each line advances image, stakes, or tone—and no typo/clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“golden joining” answers “fractured consciousness”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed-metaphor guard passed: brass/sea/wax metaphors stay within alchemical register. Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences show purposeful variation; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density spikes only at two earned points (mirror motif, sunset stroke) and pattern-taught early. High info density: single sentence often layers time, memory, medium. No scaffold; no mixed metaphors; opening/closing lines anchor and recharge.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes: long sentence for dawn calm, then clipped clauses at the whisper release. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“protective aura” is the only near-purple line, but it is brief and character-true. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Tense stable, pronouns clean, final line cadence echoes opening lighthouse image, giving circular ear-satisfaction.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “whisper > shout” maritime experiment feels fresh against lighthouse lore; the cork-as-filter is a specific, non-generic talisman. Jasmine scent as transoceanic carrier transforms a familiar lost-sibling trope into sensory magic that follows its own logic. Risk is taken: quiet climax instead of rescue spectacle, but it pays off under the lyric lens. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight—every detail re-illuminates when the vibration returns.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “patches of skin grafted from donors” packs biography in five words. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are consistent—navigation, thread, tide, bridge—forming coherent maritime loom. Rhythm varies: long cadence for starlit vastness, staccato for midnight call. Information dense: “raw solace” in one adjective-noun pair distills entire emotional state. Minor near-mixed metaphor “geography of loss” is allowed under lyrical license and pays off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances knowledge, image, or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh—“arthritic fingers,” “fractal patterns like frozen lightning”—and physically coherent. Strong verbs (“clung,” “poised,” “unfurled”) carry weight without modifier clutter. Rhythm modulates: long sensory lines open, clipped recitation mid, luminous closure. Opening line anchors both vocation and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges orchard/eye motifs. Copy clean: no tense drift, ambiguous pronouns, or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: “opal dock,” “moon-bleached bone,” fresh without purple overload. Information density high; sentences layer sight, smell, memory. Minor paraphrase loop—“mist rose thicker… mist curled”—but does not obscure causality. Mixed metaphor check clean. Filter verbs minimal; concrete perception dominates. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo. No significant artifacts in final third; thus 9+ not disallowed. Ear-test rhythm varied; paragraph cuts create visual breath. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence layers cartographic metaphor onto emotional beat. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay inside physical logic (water = ink, crystals = lenses). Opening and closing lines act as cartographic legend and compass-rose. A micro-tighten—delete “testament to solitude” cliché—would hit 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences layer action, sensory detail, and meaning—e.g., “bleeding starlight… luminescent tears into liquid sapphire” does triple duty. Rhythm breathes with ascent exertion versus cavern hush. Minor scaffold: “they shared an exhale spotting…” could trim spotting; “gilded cage” cliché. No loops in final third; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language clusters around ember and spiral imagery without crowding beats. One paraphrase loop (“scientifically romantic” ×3) and a single mixed metaphor (“palette of resolve” vs. “palette of techniques”) slightly dull the edge. Otherwise sentences carry double duty—sensory + emotional momentum. Final paragraph lands clean with crystalline image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with beats—short sentence at climax (“He began to soar—”), longer braided lines for accumulation. Figurative density is high but patterned: “snow sometimes fell upside down” teaches rule early, pays off at dissolve. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay inside dream logic. One paraphrase loop: “every grave was also a cradle” echoes earlier grave vision but adds reweighting, so loop is functional, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences often twin sensory and emotional work (“fingers… mapping emotional terrain”). Few filter verbs; metaphors stay consistent. Minor scaffold: “water clocks continued their steady drip” repeats near opening and closing; minimal drag. No artifacts touch closure; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is natural; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk—“steam like miniature dragons” beside “crystallized fear”—but both serve POV bias and do not clash. Information density is high; each sentence layers ink, memory, or threat. Minor scaffold: “the tea set before her steamed gently” could compress, but it anchors the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies, openings rotate, no template cadence detected. Metaphors occasionally crowd (“melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins” stacked beside “time tiptoes on broken glass”), creating a purple tint in an already dense paragraph, but none confuse causality. Information density is high; each sentence advances mood or ritual step. Copy is clean; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lyric density risks purple overload: stacked metaphors (“resounding hush settled like dust upon forgotten knowledge”) occasionally smother precision. Yet rhythm serves meditative pacing; no scaffold loops or synonym churn appear. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-earned punch. A few simultaneity glitches (“moving deeper while traversing”) and abstract vehicles keep it from flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; information density is high—“razor edges refracting light in unexpected patterns” does triple sensory, metaphorical, and plot work. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “the shepherd” noun repeats early; otherwise propulsion is fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Opening line anchors voice and concept in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances laser calibration or mushrooms’ response. Figurative language is sparse and justified—“whispers on the edge of hearing” externalizes her data-gap anxiety. One mixed-metor risk: “quiet wildfire” but it recurs intentionally and pays off in final illumination, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences build texture, then quick clauses when she spots the eyeliner numbers. Metaphors (“irony followed her like a personal shadow”) are fresh, mixed vehicles avoided. One paraphrase loop: “widen perspectives responsibly” is restated twice without new pressure, minor but noted. Closure line “just as probability intended” lands cleanly—wordplay compresses theme without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Loop patterns: “between the hum of streetlamps” is repeated eight times, functioning as bell-tone motif; taught early, it pays off in final line, so not penalized as artifact. A few scaffold phrases (“another day, another shift, another rotation”) are purposeful compression. Mixed metaphors (“pipes…like metallic intestines”) is deliberate body-horror and stays coherent. Information density is strong; most sentences twin interiority with setting or action. Some mild adjective padding (“weathered fingers,” “fragile beneath the words”) keeps it below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths swell and contract like breath. Metaphors are spare and consistent (ink as amber, twilight as surrender) with no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold near-loops (“small moments” echoed) are thematic callbacks, not artifacts, and repay at closure. Information density is high—each sentence layers action, memory, and sensory data—yet clarity holds even in the final vial-capping beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: every sentence either advances the rumor lattice or colors Archie’s mask. Metaphors are sparse but precise (“platforms disappearing beneath waves of ivy”). No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; transitions are elliptical yet clear. Final clause “grateful to him though they’d never know his name” lands with snap, no scaffolding. Minor overwrite only in the list of rumor conduits which could have been pruned by one example, but it does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; each sentence advances either sensory data or emotional reconfiguration. Metaphors are kept consistent—forest “hums,” ring “absorbs,” silence “kindles”—avoiding mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; “he felt” is replaced by direct tactile registration. One paraphrase loop—“the hidden stillpoint that existed between worlds, between emotions”—is forgivable at 750 words and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variety carries the reader across reflective and action beats without scaffold. Occasional elevated pairing (“terrifying yet welcoming”) edges toward template cadence but remains voice-motivated. Information density is high—each sentence layers task, memory, and world-rule. No mixed metaphors or loops; final paragraph avoids preachy uplift, landing on imagistic noun-phrase “strange comfort.”

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“vintage camera that held no film” does triple duty as prop, compass, inheritance. Figurative language dense but patterned early (moonlight as scattered diamonds) and paid off in mirrored hand-gestures. Minor scaffold: “joyful sorrow” repeated three times; does not dull closure. No mixed metaphors or typos.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances story or atmosphere; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent (tapestry as memory, ash as seed). Opening and closing lines are image-anchors that bookend the arc. Minor template cadence in “For weeks…For years…” but spaced and purposeful, not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Density is high—“notes becoming flowers of light” carries triple duty. One mixed metaphor stretch: “pregnant with potential that scientists had learned to capture” is abstract, not embodied, but does not touch closure. Read-aloud flow is musical, suiting subject.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density high: one sentence often does setting, motion, and metaphor (“boots splashing in puddles… metal structures hum”). Rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic patterns. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, strategic, never muddies peak beat. Clean grammar; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence layers image, motion, and concept. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Only minor scaffold: “spiralingly calm” is repeated without fresh inflection late in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—every sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Figurative layers (“forests of second thoughts,” “concrete of routine”) are limited to three, avoiding purple drift. No paraphrase loops; “cobalt” anchors color without synonym churn. Final line crystallizes without scaffolding: “great game of life” is earned by prior chess motif.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and tide-like rhythm; metaphor strings (“liquid moonlight,” “salt sugar”) cluster near climax but are pattern-taught and payoff-linked, so allowed. Occasional elevated phrase—“perpetual dance of ebb and flow”—skews toward poetic template yet remains within lyrical contract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clarity stays intact through dive sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm mimics blade strokes: short, declarative, then elongates during turbine moans. Information density high—one sentence often marries action, metaphor, backstory (“This knot… mandate’s lie”). No scaffold loops; only two adjacent “layers of” repeats (−0.2). Metaphors stay coherent: wood = emotional censorship, petals = banned mourning. Final line “like forgiveness” risks soft abstract but is earned by prior concrete flakes and figures.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length variation; paragraph breaks pace the ascent. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. Minor template cadence in “the poet felt…” openings (−0.2), but does not stall momentum. No scaffold, loops, or typos; pronoun reference clean. Closure image (“world awaited their art”) is crisp and non-explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “wilted petals and vibrant leaves into patterns only she could fully comprehend” seeds both world rule and character lens. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (glass “trapped sliver of phoenix fire”). Information density high—each clause advances botanic language, stake, or backstory. Minor register lift at “conceptual repricing” in commentary is mine, not text; the prose itself keeps diction within Elara’s lived lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence lengths swell and contract like breath. No scaffold loops, but figurative layering is dense—sometimes two metaphors per sentence—without pattern payoff, clipping momentum. High information density; minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to remember”) dull immediacy in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence-length variety. Occasional scaffold: “each drop a miniature world” echoed twice; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—cards, tape, rain, legacy packed into 750 words. No loops in final third; prop tracking accurate. Minor synonym churn (“steadily curious” twice) but not in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence music is controlled—“fabric catching the dim light like captured sunset” compresses color and motion in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated diction—“systematic forgetting,” “conceptual cost”—fits the scholarly POV. One mixed metaphor—“atoms steady yet unpredictable”—is tolerated because it is explicitly flagged as paradoxical rather than accidental sloppiness.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose breathes with scene needs—no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense (“origami in reverse”) yet purposeful, taught early and paid off in final metamorphose. Occasional stacked modifiers (“softly deliberate,” “luminous regret”) flirt with purple but stay within POV lexicon and emotional crest. Final line lands clean, recharging “blooming library” motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density—“tail tip curled… quietly vivid display of nature’s artistry” does triple sensory work; no paraphrase loops, metaphors consistent, final sentence propels without scaffold—exceptional control, one stray adverb “gently” away from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Some scaffold: “The displaced miracle wasn’t lost; it was waiting…The displaced miracle pulsed ahead…” Metaphors stay coherent, though “housing a displaced miracle” is airy. Information density is moderate—several sentences do one job. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the piece above the 7.0 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; sentence openings rotate across prepositional, participial, and noun clauses to avoid drumbeat. However, frequent stacked metaphors (“unused love…like phantom light…like silver halide crystals”) create slight coherence drag in peak beats; trimming one layer would sharpen. Occasional filter-verb clusters (“she could see them”) dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn, but the lushness borders on purple; still, it serves the textural drive and never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density lines carry double duty: “celestial hues…casting dancing shadows across her moonstruck face” anchors setting while externalizing interior branding. No mixed metaphors; star/dust/glow motifs stay internally consistent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“cosmic inheritance from ancestors…”) flirt with purple but are justified by the operatic sky. Parapraph cut test passes; removing any mid-section paragraph severs star-trace accumulation. Final third clean of loop artifacts; the closing sentence lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is loop-free; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—“midnight faces mockingly identical” sustains the chess-clock conceit without mixed logic. Information density is high: one sentence often layers setting, character, and concept (“Through wave functions, he could charm…”). Only minor scaffolding—the repeated “fractured lullaby” could be trimmed once—but it serves accumulative design, not clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information dual-loads—e.g., “gear…warm despite the cool air” marries object, sensation, anomaly in one stroke. Figurative layer stays coherent: metallic flora sustains internal logic. Minor near-repeat of “wild frontier” could be pruned once for 9-.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined: metaphors stack but follow unified aqueous/astral palette; shoreline lullaby refrain threads without distraction. Minor loop: “gentle persistence” twice in adjacent clauses; single paraphrase shimmer on “indirect routes” explanation. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene, openings vary, strong verbs (“winding,” “punched,” “coiled”) carry weight; no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphor count spikes only in the payoff beat where it is earned (“frostbitten hope”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Strong verbs (pressed, traced, ruptured) propel. Minor scaffolding: “they said” attribution for fortress lore could be trimmed, but it occupies one line and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence music is strong; parallelism (“…rise and fall…”, “…what once was and what might yet be…”) feels pattern-taught and thematically earned. No synonym loops, no mixed metaphors; occasional elevated diction (“regally unpretentious heir”) fits character mythic register. Information density high—each sentence layers ink, star, or dust image that reweights at closure—keeping momentum despite lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in cadence; no template drumbeat. Figurative language is restrained—“coastlines bled like watercolors” is the single extended metaphor and it pays off. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information is dense—each sentence adds data, memory, or sensory hit. Opening and closing lines act as tide-bookends, giving the piece a lyric arc without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally clean, but occasional modifier stacks (“awkwardly confident stride”) and three successive “something X, something Y, something timeless” clauses create template cadence that dulls final ascent. Otherwise high density—each sentence layers sensory or symbolic pressure—and no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (steam as breath of earth) are spare and coherent. One mixed vehicle: “sound like thunder” for obsidian cracking risks cliché, but the immediacy of the next sentence rescues it. Information density high—every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes—earning its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: single sentences fuse body cue, plant lore, memory (“Her hands…gentleness that belied their history”). No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay consistent under oyster/pearl logic—no mixed vehicles. Final wind sentence propels outward without clutter. Clean copy; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: strong verbs (“traced,” “smudging,” “spilling”) and vivid nouns (“charcoal,” “threads,” “motes”) keep momentum. Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and sustains voice. One paraphrase loop (“fragmented reality… scattered puzzle pieces”) and sporadic adjective stacks (“cloying sadness of failure”) slightly dull the edge; no artifacts intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, motive (“wind-carved encampment…research shelter…disappearing ink”). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is spare and coherent (“ink pooled in an intricate pattern”)—no mixed metaphors. Final line (“wind whispered…promise of new revelations”) supplies cadence without overwriting. Clean grammar; pronoun reference unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, mostly free of scaffold; however, “echoing library under snow” appears four times in 700 words, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls the final resonance. Mixed metaphors (“ripples spreading outward, touches of light in the darkness”) slightly muddy the frozen optic. Otherwise density is high and clauses propel.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean: every descriptive stroke advances atmosphere or character (“condensation forming and dispersing like thoughts”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. One paraphrase hiccup—“fierce desire to weave continuity through chaos” repeats the prior sentence’s gist—drops it from 8.8. Otherwise read-aloud rhythm is supple, with purposeful paragraph breaks mirroring the dome’s breath.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but deliberate: each sentence layers sense, stakes, or image. Figurative chains (“whisper bloomed into visible ripples,” “divine electricity”) stay coherent within the garden’s physics. A faint template cadence (“He worked by…,” “With each…”) surfaces mid-text; it does not touch closure and is pattern-taught, so the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, readable, largely free of loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“devotedly observant eyes,” “echoing observatory above clouds”) edge toward purple but don’t stall momentum. No grammar errors or pronoun drift. Information density is moderate; several beats could compress without loss. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from short pressure beats to long lullaby release. Mixed metaphor risk in “time folds like origami” but taught early and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“haunted firmware whirred to life, screens displaying code like constellations” does double work). No artifact within final third; closing line anchors image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; high information density—one sentence often layers acoustic effect, social observation, and memory. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Occasional scaffold phrase (“day after day”) and two “whisper” stem clusters are minor loops that do not touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentence does setting-anchor + character-status + stakes (“gentle radical… sought to rebuild what others had destroyed”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, memory, or motion. Figurative language is sparse and tied to mosaic logic—“fractured heavens” mirrors tile cracks, physical logic unbroken. Read-aloud rhythm passes: three-beat cadence at closure (“We are what rises from the ashes”) lands without synthetic drum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm rises and falls with musical cadence; metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic rule-set. No loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction (“temporal fragments,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift. High density maintained; final line lands cleanly. Minor over-figuration in middle paragraph keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied, but “fractally precise” and “light painting studio” become percussive refrains without accruing new charge. Two near-paraphrase loops: “motivation to illuminate hidden pathways” vs “illuminate hidden pathways in the brain,” and “static shock that had changed everything” repeated. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks; information density is high. Artifacts are moderate—do not obscure closure—but the refrain fatigue keeps the prose short of luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold clutter. Occasional modifier stacks (“factually mystical phenomenon”) and tautologies (“hovered silently in the air”) nudge it short of top-band density, but no artifact obscures causality or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses in measured cadences; sentence variety is good, information density high. Occasional template stem (“as the…”) appears three times but does not cluster in peak beats; no metaphor muddle. Closure image is clean, propelling the reweighting without scaffolding, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: one sentence can layer weather, body, and metaphor—"windswept zephyr bluff, the mist clinging to his gaunt frame like a second skin." Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. A few template cadences appear ("the silver hush of…" repeated) but serve accumulative pattern, not artifact. Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph cuts coincide with beat shifts. No scaffolding or synonym loops obscure clarity; closure image is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally through enjambed clauses that mimic hoof-clack and droplet-tick; only two mild scaffold phrases (“with metronomic regularity,” “with spindrift serenity”) repeat, not obscuring closure. Metaphors remain coherent—yarn absorbing mist, silence as music—though occasional elevated adjectives (“palimpsest,” “percolating”) flirt with register drift, down-band slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: one line can deliver sensory, emotional, and conceptual payload (“He held the glass… revealed fractured timelines”). Metaphors are consistent—circles, ripples, light-bending—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; every paragraph advances situation or image; final sentence lands cleanly. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence breathes with daylight arc, then tightens into night vigil without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: languid opening cadence accelerates to oar-stroke fragments at climax. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and precise—only two metaphors, both moon-related, never muddled. High information density: one sentence often anchors body, tool, and emotional tilt. Final line is propulsive monosyllabic flick—“the alcove glowed”—without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, near-loop-free, with high metaphor density that suits the contemplative mode. Occasional stacked modifiers (“cosmic rhythm that she alone understood”) flirt with purple, but clarity remains intact. Final sentence lands cleanly, recharging “whispered secret” from opener. No artifact obscures causality; minor paraphrase echo (“ancient beyond measure” / “ancient stones below”) is forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent (“raindrops…crystal prisms”) and sparse enough to avoid purple overload. Two near-paraphrase loops: “prismatic quiet” used three times, “keeper of secrets” twice in adjacent sentences—minor but noticeable. No artifacts touch the closure beat; information density is high, momentum steady.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “metal insect-like device hummed” does triple duty as object, motion, and sound. No scaffolding or synonym loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as thread, pain as barrier—without purple drift. Final line’s monosyllabic clatter delivers sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence shapes, but metaphors occasionally layer without payoff (“furrowed hush” twice). Filter verbs are minimal; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Density is high, yet some clauses hedge action (“seemed to press in”) where strong verb would propel.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. One scaffold loop: “the spongey dread had settled… like the damp chill” is restated almost verbatim later. Metaphors are spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated phrasing (“institutional blindness that had condemned…”) momentarily lifts register above Eli’s grounded perception, but clarity and momentum stay intact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; strong verbs (“pixelated,” “re-count,” “re-configure”) carry load without modifier clutter. Occasional lyrical amplification (“symphony of pixelated amnesty”) borders on stacked metaphor yet serves cadence. No loops, paraphrase, or filter-verb stacks; pronouns clean, temporal order clear.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong density—most sentences carry two jobs (image + finance tension). One paraphrase loop early (“territorial markers of his own design…”) and a mixed metaphor (“dusky harmony” used four times) slightly dull propulsion; no artifact intrudes on closure, and cadence varies page-wide.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density—single sentences telescope time and emotion: “For weeks, the same recurring vision had tormented her.” Figurative language is selective; mixed metaphor is avoided. Loops are minimal, but repeated “understanding dawning” phrasing in narrative and dialogue creates a faint template cadence (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat. Paragraph cut test passes—removing any paragraph would erase needed knowledge or charge. Clean grammar and tense control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diverse. Metaphors sometimes layer without payoff (“whispering fruit,” “mirror that shows darkness”) creating faint coherence drag. No paraphrase loops, but “swirling” and “vortex” recur enough to dull final third. Information density high; seed, lake, circles all multitask. Clean grammar; spatial tracking precise.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm is mostly varied; some template cadence (“they… they… they…”) and abstract latinate nouns (“visionary,” “covenant”) flatten immediacy. Figurative language is coherent but dense in climax—no contradictory metaphors. Loops are minor; information density is adequate; final image lands cleanly. Would benefit from pruning scaffold phrases (“they realized,” “they understood”) to tighten under 800-word limit.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “fruit trees grew from ancestral remains” packs life-death paradox in seven words. Figurative layer is dense but patterned early (“roots snaked between bones”) so fire-charred card payoff feels earned, not crowded. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Minor cadence echo (“catacomb orchard hummed… card… hummed”) reads as intentional incantation rather than template.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Varied sentence cadence; high info density without clutter. Only minor loop risk: “after the applause, after the dust settled, after all the losses” – deliberate anaphora, paid off, so waived. Metaphors (“hollowed out like the abandoned quarry”) stay consistent. No register drift. Clean copy; pronouns track. Final line lands crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, musical, and almost loop-free; information per sentence is high. Figurative vehicles stay internally coherent (water = memory, fire = cold consumption). Minor scaffold appears in “librarian smiled, knowing…” but does not touch closure. Final line resonates with winter-sun assonance and layered connotation, achieving read-aloud closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: short declaratives for corridor tension, then elongated, breath-paced clauses in the caves. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent—“liquid sunlight” for warmth, “crown of living light” for transformation. Minor scaffold: “abandoned hopes” is repeated three times; still, the reprise reweights meaning at closure, so the penalty is capped at −0.2. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final image; propulsion remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Varied sentence shapes; two inadvertent template cadences (“She… she… she…” trio) but pattern doesn’t overrun. Figurative language mostly disciplined—ivy “like desperate fingers” risks cliché but forgiven for POV emotional colouring; no mixed metaphors. High info density: one sentence often layers memory, object, action (“accordion bellows… patched… unlocked… bitter and sweet”). Tiny scaffold: “she had been charting… while he navigated…” compresses timeline efficiently without stall. Clean copy; one homophone-typo risk (“Her市政府 papers” lacks space) but likely artefact of formatting, not writer.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and mostly clean, but occasional modifier stacks ("spectral garments," "cautious exuberance") edge purple. No loops or scaffold detected; sentence variety good. Opening anchors stakes cleanly; final line aims for resonance yet feels slightly sermon-like. Copy-clean apart from one ellipsis omission.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “mulberry-hued drapes absorbed the relentless arctic light” does world, color, temperature, and stakes in one stroke. No loops, no scaffold; figurative language disciplined to one vehicle per beat. Internal fracture physics kept consistent. Microscopic/constellation metaphor pair could verge on mixed, but both map onto same ice matrix—stays coherent. Closure line breathes cleanly without ornamental flare.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: sibilant softness mirrors “radiant hush.” Information density high—each sentence adds sensory or emotional layer. No loops or synonym churn; “pattern” recurs with rising stakes, not padding. Metaphors (“threads across a loom”) stay consistent with textile-craft persona. Minor overwriting in “shifting patterns of green and violet light” could trim one modifier, but cadence serves aurora motion. Closure line crystallizes without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template stems or synonym loops. Some elevated phrasing—“umbral space,” “conceptual repricing” regions—edges toward register drift but remains within caretaker’s ceremonial voice. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffolding: “as she had trained to do since childhood” restates known role.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; lighthouse and chime imagery recur without algorithmic feel. Occasional elevated register (“attenuated emotional state”) drifts slightly above Elian’s plausible lexicon, but never in the closure beat. No loops or synonym churn; information density is high. One paraphrase loop around “cloak of doubt” costs −0.2, capping below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level propulsion is high: most sentences do double duty (“skin tightening” = body + time cost). Metaphor density spikes only once at closure, but because the pattern (stone-ripples-revelation) is taught early, the lyrical cluster reads as payoff, not purple. No scaffold loops; pronouns track cleanly across “he / she / his / her” chains. Final line lands on monosyllabic punch—“wisdom shared”—giving the cadence exhale the moment demands.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: only two mild paraphrase loops (“echoes…echoes,” “pulse…pulse”) and no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes—long anaphoric sentences for ritual beats, then fractured fragments when light erupts. Information density is high; each line layers time, vibration, or mythic reference. Artifacts stay clear of the closure beat, allowing 9-band proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is mostly taut; one paraphrase loop—“automation… automated… automated”—in the first paragraph dulls edge slightly. Mixed metaphor “ice glistened with a brilliant dimness” is deliberate oxymoron, not incoherence. No template cadence, no scaffold clauses. Final sentence is graceful and recharges “brilliant dimness,” earning its density. A few adjective pairs (“crystalline window,” “soft, persistent light”) verge on decorative but stay within lyric allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphor density peaks in library symphony but pattern is taught early via lantern constellation, so payoff feels earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Clause rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored. One near-slip—“truth that hides behind truth itself” flirts with tautology but is saved by immediacy of librarian’s smile.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences show variety and momentum; no scaffold loops or template cadence detected. Occasional elevated phrasing—“inexorable contraction,” “cosmic voices”—is purposeful but slightly dilutes immediacy. High information density keeps description multitasking. Line-level craft is competent, not dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length; opening compound clause vs final short “Well done.” Figurative language clustered in naming beats but serves pattern, not density overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Strong verbs—“pooled,” “fluttered,” “crystallize”—propel without excess modifiers. Clean grammar, consistent tense.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is vivid but dense; three metaphors in four sentences (“fallen giant,” “counting down,” “settling stars”) risk coherence drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, yet elevated register edges into purple during the climax. Information density is high; tightening two adjective strings would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the ebb of water; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layer (“mirrored hush,” “violet and indigo”) is sparse and purposive—does not flood key beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge without scaffolding. Minor: “thirty years” and “decades-long” echo faintly; not enough to dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence (“molten copper,” “kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “ancient freshness”) creating a perfume-cloud that slows momentum. Several near-paraphrase loops (“the touch of wonder she had been seeking… now a permanent part of her being”) pad the beat. No grammatical slips, yet density exceeds information; a trim would sharpen the glow.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence variety strong; only minor scaffold: “the watcher's burden...the pattern seeker...the watcher” noun-cycles without new payload. One paraphrase loop on “preserve trust under pressure” reprise; otherwise information density high, metaphors coherent, no register drift. Closure line is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean: high information density, strong verbs, no scaffold loops. Occasional modifier stacks (“cosmic transformations unfolding before her eyes”) flirt with overwriting but occur in low-pressure beats; the climax itself is spare. One paraphrase loop—“history rewriting itself” appears twice in four lines—costs a fractional nip. Otherwise sentences advance on multiple fronts without cluttering the glow of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lush yet accumulates paraphrase loops: “hush of possibility just born” / “storm-born silence” / “quiet moments of storm-born silence” create synonym churn that dulls closure image. Mixed metaphors are minor (“canvas for something extraordinary” beside flow motifs) but do not break clarity. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; paragraph cuts are clean. A few stacked modifiers (“personal haven beside Moonshadow Brook, a quiet waterway…”) could be pruned for density.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm alternates between engine chug and lyrical surge, mirroring the sonic subject; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density is high: one sentence often performs sensory, emotional, and tactical work (“Raising the blower's nozzle…began”). Figurative language is selective, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold: “mournfully eager” is repeated three times; while thematic, the adverb-adjective pairing begins to loop. No mixed metaphors; physical logic of airflow and echo remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, paragraph lengths varied; sentences carry dual duty—image and concept—achieving high density. Occasional soft loops (“the boundaries of light…boundaries between interior and exterior”) are thematic reprise, not scaffold, so forgiven. Metaphors (“playground of possibility”) risk mild abstraction but stay coherent. No artifact touches closure; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image, pressure, or atmosphere. Figurative language is patterned early (“ember nexus… frozen bloom”) and paid off without muddle. One mixed metaphor—“winter finding purchase in autumn’s resistance”—is minor enough to miss closure. High information density: vial contents list doubles as character backstory. No synonym churn or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Sparse scaffold—only two near-paraphrase clusters (“abandoned city suspended over the gorge” echoed). Figurative language disciplined: “serenely electric” is motif, not purple. One filter-verb stack in the third beat “began to glow brighter” but does not clog climax; stays below 9-floor but prose is publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythm, vivid metaphor, high density; occasional stacked epithets (“ancient chronal energy older than humanity”) verge on purple but don’t stall clarity. Zero loops or scaffold; temporal sequencing clean. One mixed metaphor (“patterns glow...like a lover”) momentarily jars, yet closure image stays sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences weave action, sensory detail, and metaphor (“colors…bleed…walls seemed to breathe”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor cluster—“ever-shifting landscape of possibility”—but it occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during sensory measurement, lengthen during reflection. Information density is solid—many sentences perform double duty. One scaffold loop: “its weight...its surface...its circular form” within 3 lines (−0.3). Metaphors stay coherent (anchor↔gravity↔orbital paths). No typos, tense hops, or buried leads. Overall propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly loop-free; occasional adjective stacks (“mist-clad atrium at twilight, dim blue light barely penetrates the ethereal fog”) approach overwriting but serve atmospheric density. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final line achieves charged image without scaffolding. Minor paraphrase in “emotional resonance to flow through her” could compress, but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are lean, varied, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“tired giant,” “fibrous veins”) and paid off in final “sacred silence between.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines perform double duty—anchor tone and reweight image—while paragraph cuts tighten to single-sentence beats at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with snowfall cadence; sentence lengths vary. Occasional softeners (“by all accounts,” “seemed different”) dilute immediacy but do not loop. Metaphors stay coherent (snow globe of night). No scaffold or synonym churn. Information density is high; each paragraph advances memory-work or atmosphere. Final third is clean, so 9+ global cap is waived; still, a few nominalizations (“existence,” “understanding”) slacken propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“echoes filling the tunnel…echoes of the language”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final image is uncluttered, letting the hum land.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative layering serves awe rather than stalls. Minor loop: “metamorphose” and “transformations” repeat within two sentences; “frostbitten hope” appears three times, risking motif fatigue. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for orchard awe, clipped fragments for flight. Figurative language is selective: “sky the color of aged copper” does double world + mood work. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“music bounding ahead” then “roots entwined with metal”) is minor. Information density is high; every sentence advances image or beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, no loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“cobalt arcade lights flickered to life against the twilight”—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges ledger motif. One minor scaffold: “arcade patrons glanced nervously” could be tighter, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: sentence length varies to mirror carousel turn and breath of song. Information density is high—each sentence layers setting, emotion, and metaphor without scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“oasis inside a train car”) is physically impossible but taught early and paid off, so permitted. No loops, filter-verb stacks, or paraphrase padding; opening and closing lines are crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathes: long sentences build night-time hush, fragments punch climax. Metaphors are disciplined—scarf as synapse, stories as roots seeking water—no mixed vehicles. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. A single minor scaffold: “sanely eccentric” is reused twice; because it is her defining trait and the second use precedes the scarf’s dissolution, it reads as deliberate reprise, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or emotion. No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay within photic/bibliographic register; no mixed vehicles. Final third is clean—no artifact touches closure beat—permitting 8+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances ritual, image, or interior tilt. Figurative language is patterned—star/chain/ribbon—paid off at closure. One register lift: “conceptual repricing” feeling borders academic; minor but keeps from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long accumulative catalogues to staccato realizations, propelling the accretive design. Figurative language is sparse but precise—no mixed metaphors; “skeletons surrendering” is single clean image. One near-loop: “memory thieves—folklore that seemed absurd until…” repeats concept twice in adjacent clauses; however, the second clause adds plot consequence, so penalty is minor. High density achieved with near-zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm employs anaphora and polysyndeton to mimic water’s pulse; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—water as time, seed as prism—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense lines carry double duty: “rushing water seemed to quiet” marries action and metaphor. Minor scaffold: “the pruner began her method by capturing essence…” (slight loop) but it precedes the final third, so 9+ is not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—“silver glint catching the multicolored light that fractured” does three jobs in nine words. Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphors. Only a single filter-verb stack (“seemed to pulse”) keeps it from 9+; still within tolerance. Closing sentence lands clean, recharges “mended masks” motif without forced echo.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rain-scoured fresco vault,” “whispered chapel,” each noun phrase doing double duty for atmosphere and metaphor. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay physical—maps as windows, tears as thresholds—avoiding mixed logic. Final line cadence mirrors a map’s edge: short, serrated, final.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: every sentence either advances inspection, supplies sensory anchor, or layers the globe motif. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor stays consistent (water = barrier). Opening and closing lines are sharp—first anchors place, last recharges object. A single mixed image (“melancholy… beautiful in its clarity”) is minor; it neither obscures causality nor dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is compressed and musical; sentences vary in length and syntax, mirroring the storm-breath cadence. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; “taffy-stretch time” returns with reweighted meaning. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to form… seemed to shift”) is minor; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “crystalline walls fracturing the light into scattered patterns” seeds both setting and decryption method. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, deliberate. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; removing any elevator floor would erase causal step. Final line lands with crisp, image-driven cadence that recharges “scattered light” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or sensory charge. Information density high: one line slips in mentor’s disappearance, cloud emotion, and career stakes. Metaphors stay internally consistent (cosmic dust / dusty starlight) and never break physics. Rhythm modulates with gondola sway—long sentences for drift, fragments for heartbeat peaks. Opening line anchors voice and peril; final line resolves by image that re-catalyzes “dusty starlight” motif without sermons. No typos, tense slips, or buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene temperature—looped cadence while she maps, staccato beats at coin discovery. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, interior calculus, and plot advancement. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (moon as witness, constellations on floor) stay consistent. Only minor scaffolding: “heightened stillness” is repeated once more than necessary, not quite dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid scaffold. Occasional softeners (“seemed suspended,” “something about it resonated”) slightly dull immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors; technical terms (luminance, cipher) used accurately. High-band gate missed because figurative language never risks real strangeness or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: selective metaphors (driftwood, eclipse, sighing box) recur with purpose, avoiding purple overload. Information density high—one sentence often layers setting, tool, and emotion. A few soft filters (“seemed to lean,” “as if”) slightly dilute immediacy during the climactic uncapping. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies, paragraphs breathe, final line echoes opener to create cadence closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose flows with varied sentence length and strong forward motion; no scaffold loops or synonym churn stall the read. Occasional softeners (“seemed,” “showed signs of”) slightly dampen urgency, but they vanish before the climax. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and the seed-pod bell image is precise. A single paraphrase loop (“strangers into family” / “strangers became family”) costs a hairline -0.2, preventing the 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long breathy sentences for ascent, clipped fragments for the stutter. Figurative language is dense but patterned (“threads of fractured starlight,” “bruised orange hues”) and avoids muddle. One scaffold loop—“the hush remained, deep and watchful, holding the lullaby safe within its nested patterns”—is purposeful echo, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence stems vary. Light scaffold appears: “he began to…,” “he knew he must…,” “he returned to…,”—functional but template-flavored. Figurative language is familiar (twilight “painted,” frost “glittering”) and stays clear of mixed vehicles; no loop obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates well—short, observational fragments during descent, longer riff sentences for insight. Figurative language stays consistent with science/music overlap; no mixed metaphor violations. One minor template cadence detected in “how…how…” anaphora on polymer chains, but it serves cadence, not clutter. Line density is high: each sentence adds image, causality, or atmosphere; zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: selective metaphors, no mixed vehicles. Two adjacent sentences repeat “vendor finally understood” concept, a micro-loop that slows the closure beat. Otherwise density is high—each sentence layers image or rule. Read-aloud rhythm varies, paragraph cuts purposeful. Artifacts minor; none obscure causality or dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm breathes with the beats: long reflective sentences build, then shorten when Kael touches the pool. Figurative layering is dense (“sandpaper rough memories”) but consistent with the chef-tool lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “brittle walls… brittle nature” within three sentences; a -0.2. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Closure image is clean, tactile, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“she knew,” “she understood”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Information density is high: one sentence often advances scene and symbolism together. Occasional soft fillers—“with each passing sunset”—but none occur in the closure beat, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong information density: single sentences fuse action, image, and concept—“moonlight painted circuit boards in ethereal blues while the periscope’s broken edges carved patterns.” However, figurative language clusters heavily in every sentence of the activation beat, creating purple overlap that dulls the closure image; a −0.5 artifact applies. Several paraphrase loops (“abandoned dreams” restated four times) and template cadence (“they whispered,” “they muttered,” “they smiled”) accumulate −0.4. Rhythm is musical but repetitive; variety arrives late. Proofing is clean; no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely clean; sentences vary and propel. Minor loops—“latent blaze” thrice, “clandestinely luminous” five times—serve incantation but slightly dull the climax. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding clutter. Final paragraph stacks three “would” futures that soften the exit beat; a crisper image could sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “whispered secrets” / “ember within” compress metaphor and motive in four words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or knowledge. Figurative language retreats during the high-pressure strumming sequence, letting concrete nouns and verbs carry propulsion. Final line’s monosyllabic beat (“the work of redemption began anew”) lands as cadence shift, not slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences layer sensory and conceptual info without scaffold. Metaphors stay within vibrational domain, avoiding mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“silences hummed… others vibrated”) but corrected quickly; no artifacts in closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm purposeful; paragraph cuts timed to sonic beats. Copy clean. Minor thesaurus uplift (“celestial light”) but within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is textured yet efficient: “rope bridges of the mysterious treetop village with practiced ease” compresses setting, body, and habit in one stroke. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“village lights twinkled like stars brought to earth”) it recharges the closure image rather than stalls momentum. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-repeat: “the turning of the tide’s thought” appears twice without fresh inflection, a micro-drag that keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive—“rivers tore free…silver serpents.” One paraphrase loop: “latticed shadows across the endless orchards” echoes prior “latticed shadows” two sentences earlier. No mixed metaphors or scaffold in peak beats. Clean grammar, varied syntax, strong paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences often do two jobs (“The silence was absolute—no machinery, no voices…”) while avoiding template cadence. Minor loop near “rapidly adapting mind processed these anomalies” echoes earlier “rapidly adapting to changing conditions,” but the overlap is local. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; clarity propels rather than drags.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: periodic sentences rise and break like auroral waves; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—indigo as “distant stars” maintains light-sound continuum. Information-dense: one sentence can layer bell-strike, color, temperature, heritage. Only micro-loop: “wonder made manifest… essential to the human spirit” restates prior beat; trims −0.2. Closure sentence is artifact-free, pure image recharge.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm mimics inhalations of flute breaths—long evocative clauses alternate with terse placements of sticks. Metaphors (avalanche, pearlescence) stay physically coherent within mountain acoustics. Information density is high: “weight…pressing…like ancient stones” fuses body, guilt, geology in one stroke. Final line cadence—“the canyon hush remained within him”—delivers closure without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies well; sentences open with participial light-play then snap to verb-driven commands. Minor loop: “another star vanished… One more star vanished” repeats within 60 words; not fatal but keeps it sub-9. Metaphors stay coherent (light = data) and propel rather than stall.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion; sentences vary naturally. Occasional soft loops (“pendant began vibrating sympathetically once more”) and two “germinate” repetitions in close proximity, but none sit in the final third or obscure closure image. Metaphors stay coherent (aurora=path, earth=memory). Information density is high; each sentence advances image or arc. No scaffolding or synonym churn in climax beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences do double duty. Minor scaffold: “the quartz arbor in mist” is repeated verbatim three times, creating template cadence that dulls the final paragraph. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; frost imagery stays coherent. Tightening the refrain would lift the line-level above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured; sentences vary in length without algorithmic pattern. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and precise—glow casts “mocking recognition,” dust “caught the light of magical flames.” Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with sonic echo. One micro loop: “his hands moved with purpose, his eyes seeing possibility” repeats the prior beat’s sense; −0.2, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with strong verbs—“fray,” “thrumming,” “receded”—carrying double duty. One paraphrase loop (“half-remembered dreams” echoed three times) and a filter-stack (“felt,” “sensed,” “seemed”) slightly dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors (“sailors reading invisible seas”) risk overwriting, but the final beat stays clean. Overall momentum survives the lyric surplus.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences advance atmosphere and insight simultaneously. Occasional modifier stacks (“jade green and polished by the endless tides”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: “protect its silence just as he protected the light” restates prior clause without new pressure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Paragraph openings vary; sensory detail is selective, not checklist. One mixed metaphor: “laughter bubbled up unexpectedly” collides with “storm herald,” but the image soon settles. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional stacked modifiers (“emerald lighthouse under stars”) yet each noun later earns plot work, so texture justifies itself. Closure line is clean, propulsive, loop-free.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths ebb with light movement. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual data. Figurative language clusters in descriptive beats; no mixed metaphors but slight density drag in “valley-mist wonder” refrain. Minor scaffold: repeated “track sun trails” and “quietly explosive” echo without new inflection. No artifact touches closure; clarity remains intact, though slight tightening could lift band into 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry high density: moonlight “knitted his skin faster than any medicine” does plot + image + consequence in one stroke. Occasional adjective clusters (“impossibly ancient even when the tower was built”) verge on decoration but do not stall momentum or tangle causality; no loops or mixed metaphors near the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence length modulates with weaving pace. Density high—e.g.,“phosphorescent flora pulsing with remembered colors” fuses world, body, metaphor. No mixed metaphors; plant-light logic stays consistent. Minor loop risk: “woven dawns required care” repeats concept soon after “woven dawn took shape,” but cadence shift justifies echo. Closure image crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; high density—“keenly empathetic nature allowed her to feel the disappointment of the sender” packs interpersonal reading into one clause; metaphors (library as “ordinary exterior… extraordinary knowledge”) stay coherent; final line cadence mirrors dawn hush without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: descriptive lulls accelerate at letter reveal. No template cadence or synonym loops; “bread” reprises with shifted meaning, not repetition for filler. Mixed metaphors absent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image (“remaining pieces…for whoever might need”) recharges motif. Filter verbs minimal and motivated (“she considered”). High information density: single sentences deliver setting, memory, and moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, scaffold-free; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—each sentence advances ritual, atmosphere, or frequency data without padding. Figurative language is spare and coherent: “quartz hush,” “crystallized time,” all consistent with frozen-library physics. Occasional adjectival uplift (“luminous,” “ethereal”) is purposeful, not purple, and never muddies closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: compound images (“aurora pulsed… voting algorithms”) perform scene work while layering metaphor. Rhythm modulates: breathless pre-handshake cadence, then ionized stillness. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Pronoun and spatial tracking clean. Opening/final lines anchor and recharge motif. Artifacts absent; closure beat crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with doubled-duty lines: 'charcoal-fingered...ghostly marks' fuses portrait, medium, and guilt in opener. Rhythm varies: long clause descends steps, then staccato 'now only silence' mimics dropped echoes. No scaffold or synonym loops; 'auroral sorrow' risks purple but is single allowed lyric peak. Figurative logic coherent—charcoal as both medium and internal residue—metaphor sustained without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical but occasionally overwritten: “desperate botanical life raft,” “evaporated tears” border on purple. A few template cadences (“she finally understood…”) could be trimmed. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene temperature, and no loops or mixed metaphors obscure causality at the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each metaphor extends the sound-light fusion rather than decorating emptily. Rhythm varies—from echoing anaphora to single-clause fragments mimicking struck overtones. No loops or synonym churn detected; “glisten” recurs only with earned thematic weight. A single strained image—“inspiration struck with the force of revelation”—is the lone purple moment, not repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary from staccato crisis beats to longer twilight cadences; information density is high (polishing, pulse, chest-box, protocol 34 all within 100 words). One paraphrase loop (“the android’s fingers traced…”) and a mixed metaphor (“inner static” vs. “electromagnetic pulse”) ding minor clarity, but neither touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Figurative language is restrained—sandstorm calm, rising sun gold—serving tone without overcrowding. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the locket motif efficiently. Density is solid for 700-word range, though occasional abstract phrasing (“subtle thread of curiosity”) softens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length variation; information often dual-purpose (“obsidian cubes etched with symbols of fate” reveals object + mythic tone). However, metaphor density is high throughout (“spider spins its web” repeated thrice) without pattern payoff, triggering −0.3. Near-paraphrase loops (“mysterious familiarity” echoed four times) dull the closure image, applying the −0.4 template-cadence penalty. No grammatical slips, but over-decoration keeps score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong information density: one sentence delivers salt, gravity, neurons. Mixed-metaphor risk in “neural pathways” vs “folding dimensions” passes because pattern is taught early. Minor template cadence—“she...she...she...” in paragraph 4—does not touch closure. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, with purposeful paragraph variation; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (“city skyline glittering below like constellations on earth”). Filter verbs are minimal; information density is high. One mixed image—“language that had been waiting centuries to be understood again”—is forgivable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rich figurative layering occasionally over-inks one moment: four velvet references in five sentences; "tragically radiant" and "luminous cheek" verge on purple. No loops or scaffold, but density slows propulsion at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay coherent—“stone dissolved like mist” sustains marble/air polarity. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, memory, and thematic link. No loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph keeps propulsion while shifting to lyrical exit: short clauses echo heartbeat after long confession. Only micro-slip: “wisely enduring home” leans into adverb uplift, but fits reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to the staccato of unravelling threads, mirroring disclosure beats. Metaphors (webs, reed, echo) form a coherent family; no mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffold—only “the whispering seashell half” repeats for thematic reprise, justified.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies between long, liquid descents and short pressure bursts—“They came … as fragments.” Synonym churn is absent; “salvage” and “wreck” recur with thematic purpose. Mixed metaphors are controlled: starlight/ice/water imagery coheres around luminescent cold. One loop: “windows of connection” is defined twice in adjacent clauses; trims 0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances goal, image, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Micro-paragraphs (“Foam sea.”) mimic breath of tea ritual. Metaphors stay coherent—net, foam, firefly lights form one textile cosmology. Information-dense: one line can body, object, and idea. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; no artifact in final third. Clean copy; no tense or simultaneity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; few scaffolding phrases. Occasional stacked modifiers—“radioactive dust storms,” “impossibly perfect amid the wasteland orchard”—approach purple but stay within POV awe. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One template cadence alert: four consecutive sentences opening “She…” in final paragraph; −0.2. Otherwise rhythmic variety supports momentum and closure image clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates from rolling cumulus clauses to sharp ozone-tanged fragments, propelling accumulative density without clogging. Metaphors stay atmospheric-coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“the rise of a prophet begins…” echoed two sentences later) clipped –0.2. Otherwise line-level craft is clean, propulsive, and image-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical—varied cadence, strong verbs, little scaffolding—but figurative density spikes in the music-box paragraph (“love stories that had ended too soon”) without new causal information, costing momentum. Elsewhere, sentences carry double duty: “Sunlight filtered…illuminating dust motes dancing” advances both setting and emotional state. No loops or synonym churn. A trim of the ornate stanza would push this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates propulsion and breath; no template cadence. Metaphors are spare and precise: “drift ice cracked like distant bones” fuses soundscape with stakes. Information density high—single sentences deliver motion, temperature, and heritage. No scaffold loops; only micro-slip “the lighthouse’s massive sound fog warning system” could drop “massive” without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence either furthers evidence collection or layers atmosphere. No scaffold repeats or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (“lantern seemed to reverberate with history”). Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is embedded in action. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, creating a tidy frame that recharges the lantern motif.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language is spare and purposeful (“wavering… like a spirit trapped”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“weight… like dust particles”) is minor. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes. Paragraph cut test passes—each graf advances knowledge or charge. No line-level artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies from percussive gear-clicks to long lyrical release at closure; no template cadence. Dense figuratives—“gears of the workshop floor,” “acid sea roared below”—but kept selective, not every sentence. One paraphrase loop: “steadily curious nature” repeated thrice with near-identical phrasing, minor drag. Otherwise clean mechanics, concrete nouns, no filter-verb clusters in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence variety and propulsion strong; opening line anchors. Figurative layering is dense—three metaphors in two sentences (“constellations,” “digital necropolis,” “ghosts in the machine”)—but pattern is taught early and echoed at closure, so allowed. One template cadence hiccup: “something that… something that… something that…” in video fragment, dulling peak beat. No paraphrase loops or typos.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: high density per sentence, minimal scaffold. Figurative strings cluster in the ritual paragraph—purple risk—but pattern is taught (shadow = medium) and pays off. One mixed metaphor: “shadows…like ink in water” adjacent “purple twilight” slightly muddies palette, yet clarifies through context. Rhythm breathes with tide-groans and beam-sweeps; final line lands clean, crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical without purple overload. Information-dense lines: “trawled not just the waters but her own memories, examining each one like a precious stone.” Occasional soft scaffolding: “she found herself drawn…” (mild filter). No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Final image “first stars appeared above the drift-ice marina” lands with crisp cadence. Minor hedge words (“seemed,” “felt”) pepper emotional peaks; tightening would reach 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates; no algorithmic patterns. Figurative language is restrained—seasonal metaphors aligned to emotional state, no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold (“After the final bus departed…”) is repeated for liturgical effect rather than padding, and it tightens at closure. Information density high: one sentence often does scene-work plus metaphor. Minor loop: “gentle persuasion” phrase struck three times; not fatal. Clean grammar, tactile specificity, no typos. Overall fluid, publishable line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence music is deliberate: parallelism and anaphora (“After the prophet…”) teach the liturgical cadence, then pay off in the hush of the final line. A few soft repetitions (“the line walker…”) approach template cadence but stay purposive. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. High information density—each sentence layers task, world, and cost—keeps momentum through 755 words.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative layers (“metal bones reclaimed by nature”) are spare and purposeful, never clustering in peak beats. Occasional elevated diction (“transmute,” “earnest whimsy”) is justified by Elara’s archivist persona. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance effectively; paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing mood or motion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is textured yet efficient—single sentences carry atmosphere, motive, and sensory hit. No scaffold loops; only recurrent phrase is “fractured sequences,” which functions as mantra rather than churn. Rhythm breathes appropriately—long sentences for library hush, shorter bursts for memory shards. Figurative control strong: dust “like spirits” is fresh without purple intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is supple, high-density; most sentences do double duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional soft repeats—“arranging driftwood as directional markers” formula appears thrice; minor loop. Mixed-metaphor risk in “ships in a misty harbor” but clears. No artifact touches closure beat; momentum breathes well.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong noun-verb pairings: “dust from the ceiling,” “leathered the boundaries.” No paraphrase loops; metaphor density peaks only in the final paragraph where it is warranted. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One near-mixed metaphor (“leathered the boundaries”) but clarity survives. Closure beat is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is musical—crescendo of participial openings, then a single monosyllabic beat (“We all know better times aren’t coming”). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds a new sensory or emotional increment. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught (“pulsing stillness”) and paid off in the last line. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” zone diction in “reunification isn’t about physical presence”—but occurs in a low-pressure beat and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, high-density: each sentence moves (action + imagery + world-rule). No synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors lean cosmic (“living shadows given form”) but stay internally consistent. One paraphrase loop—“closing loops, I relearn” repeated twice—docks 0.2. Closure line is crisp image, not explanation. Within striking distance of 8+ if figurative load had been slightly lighter under blinding-light beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are dense yet transparent (“Victorian-era botanical engineering giving rise to plants that bloomed upside down or glowed with captured firefly light” packs world, time, wonder). Figurative layer stays purposeful—iris, light, constellation—each returned to charge closure; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemology,” “conceptual repricing”) fits narrator’s academic tilt but momentarily lifts above embodied lexis, preventing full 9-band entry. Beat-level propulsion is clean; no scaffold loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Metaphors occasionally collide:“pearl of stillness” as both sphere and emotional state; “zephyr bloom” is pretty but imprecise. Dense figurative runs in the stillness paragraph tip toward overwriting. Otherwise sentences vary, props track, verbs stay strong; no scaffold loops or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (icicle → spiral → grief map → offering). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for moss reverie, staccato prepositional fragments for glass-crunch tension. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional information. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not exposition. Only one mixed-metaphor risk—“honeyed hush” paired with “balm”—but it passes the ear test and does not reappear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but loop-aware: repeated “against the current,” “lucidly watchful,” “swirling hush” create deliberate incantatory pattern that pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; minor paraphrase loops (−0.2) but high information density per sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is largely clean: no scaffold loops, no synonym churn, metaphors consistent (“spun golden stories” thread holds). One mixed image—“sand through fingers” beside “loom of song”—but clarity survives. Information density good; most sentences advance plot or image. Final third stays artifact-free, allowing 8+ band. Minor over-modifying (“enormous and amber”) keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: each sentence layers sensory or symbolic weight without paraphrase loops. Only minor template cadence in “the alchemist + verb” openings across three adjacent lines. Metaphors (skeletal fingers, flash-paper shimmering) stay coherent. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, letting image carry closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for meticulous mapping, staccato for clicks and thrums. Figurative language sparse and accurate—“second heartbeat” is earned physiologically. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances angle, emotion, or tool state. Minor scaffold: “wounded season” repeated identically twice; −0.1 for template cadence that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence and varied sentence openings. Figurative layer is dense but patterned (geological/star/weight imagery) and taught early. Occasional near-loops: “boundary-lessly trapped” repeats three times without new inflection; “shingled hush” layers atop “layers of silence.” No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Minor scaffold: “the weaver knew… they shook their head” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor engine runs high but pattern is taught early and pays off in lion-mane image; no loops or mixed vehicles, though occasional elevated diction (“crystallized time”) edges toward register drift.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Widow-carves-lion premise risks sentimentality, but inversion to serene rather than snarling lion, plus kettle-boil temporal scaffold, gives fresh inflection; still, core metaphor remains familiar enough to cap below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. High information density: single sentences deliver scavenger posture, carousel halt, camera discovery. Minimal scaffold; no synonym loops except one “shimmering” echo. Two mixed metaphors—“carousel ground to an abrupt halt” vs. “waters still now”—but they occur early and do not obscure closure. Filter verbs rare; most perception is direct.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, high density, no scaffold loops; metaphor count is spare and justified (“sleeping giants”). Occasional elevated phrasing—“luminous cadence of awakening stars”—skirts but avoids purple by serving tonal crescendo. Opening line anchors stakes and voice cleanly; final line offers image-based resolution. Minor paraphrase echo: “maze of intentions” repeated without new inflection, a –0.2 tick.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft excels: no scaffold loops; each sentence layers sensory or emotional info. Metaphors (glacial hush, crystal stars) stay consistent to cold/light axis. Opening line anchors voice + age + occupation in 18 words. Final line cadence mirrors opening cadence, creating circular hush without repetition. Minor tic: “excruciatingly gentle” used thrice; pattern teaches intention, earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences multi-task (sundial as metaphor + character legacy). One scaffold loop: “she had come here to salvage something more than physical artifacts—she sought fragments of truth” paraphrases prior sentence; minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; closing line recharges “twilight between what was known and what was hidden” with earned echo.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—snow “dusting” planks, fog “swallowing” boats—never stacks up to blur sense. Information density high: each sentence advances atmosphere or micro-gesture. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“The crimson weft thread…fragile than spun sugar when held against the weight of memory”). One paraphrase loop (“river of explanations…explained absence”) docks −0.3. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence earns its emphatic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often layers setting, emotion, and metaphor. Figurative language is disciplined—limited to two metaphors per beat, no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “patterns that mimicked organic life but lacked its soul” is restated four sentences later as “lacked its soul” again. Final line’s “dreaming of flight” rescues cadence with a resonant send-off.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clean with high density; figurative language is purposeful, not overwrought. No loops or synonym churn detected. Occasional template pattern (“Maya…as she…”) in three adjacent sentences mid-story momentarily drums; small scaffold phrases (“the obsidian lagoon reflected…”) recur. These micro-ripples do not touch closure, so the cap stays above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    High metaphor density risks purple overload—“stone throats,” “luminous skeptic”—but the pattern is self-consistent and never muddies causality. A few scaffold phrases (“the city seemed to breathe”) could compress, yet information density stays high and the ear-varied cadence carries the lyrical design.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—metaphors stay within cosmic physics, no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; each sentence layers image and concept. Repetitive anaphora (“The calculating machine gear…”) approaches loop territory yet serves mantra-like pattern, so only −0.3. No scaffold or synonym churn obscures closure; final line snaps clean.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: opening spondaic clusters (“fiercely meditative,” “ancient granite”) give way to softer anapestic flow as dusk settles. Metaphors stay coherent—butterflies as “unsettled spirits” remains within grief logic; no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold (“the same dusk light that had illuminated…”) but only one instance, not repeated. Information density high: single sentence often bundles tool, sensory cue, memory, and forward motion. Minor overwrite: “thundering calm” is used thrice; while purposeful, the third recurrence edges toward mantra. No typos, tense shifts, or simultaneity errors; paragraph cuts are crisp, each advancing image or ritual beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; short beats during climb, longer reflective cadence at ridge. One paraphrase loop—“shared balance” repeated in inscription and thought—dings slightly. No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; information density stays high. Closure line is crisp, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences do double duty (“painting them a deep cobalt blue that absorbed the starlight rather than reflected it”). Occasional soft filler (“as if the universe had shifted slightly”) and one metaphor pile (“uncharted echoes…hidden brook”) slightly dull the peak, but no loop touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, paragraphs breathe, openings vary; occasional adjective stacks (“iridescent blues”) are restrained. Information density is solid—one sentence often marries setting, task, and stakes. Minor loop: “the predictive modeling she used combined…” restates prior info; one −0.2 paraphrase tick. No mixed metaphors or artifact intrusion in closure beat, keeping high-band eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or concept. Metaphors (dust as water, narratives as food) stay coherent and purposeful. A few template cadences (“she would…,” “the dust would…”) create faint rhythmic loops, not severe enough to dull the closure image. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding冗余; the read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening long phrase mirrors pendulum, later fragments mimic shards. High density ("powdered the surface... fine dust settled into cracks") performs two jobs—action and atmosphere. Occasional Latinate pairs ("conceptual shift", "conceptual cost") nudge toward abstraction, but they surface outside peak pressure beats, so penalty stays minor (−0.2). No scaffold loops, mixed metaphor, or template cadence; closure image remains luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density, largely free of loops; figurative language is spare and functional (“sedimentary layers of collective forgetting”). One near-loop—“centuries of accumulated silt / sedimentary layers of the sunken city”—survives but does not dull closure. Opening and closing lines are crisp, image-driven, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; figurative language is sparing and purposeful. No mixed metaphors, scaffold loops, or paraphrase churn detected. Register is consistent; no academic drift. Final lines avoid overwrought resonance yet deliver a hush that reconfigures earlier motifs—an earned cadence rather than a drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal glow,” “conceptual repricing”) fits lyrical mode but slightly softens culinary grit. One paraphrase loop: “revolution started with seeds—not stones” restates prior idea. No artifacts touch closure; opening and final lines are crisp and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence music is varied; no template cadence detected. Occasional soft filler—“seemed to,” “almost”—slows propulsion but never clusters. Metaphor chain (streetlights daydream, shard drinks sound) is coherent and paid off. No paraphrase loops; information density is high, each sentence advancing atmosphere or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes—long aqueous sentences swell, then fragment as the vision fades. Occasional “seemed to” filters are POV-motivated uncertainty, not clutter. One paraphrase loop (“truth…thread…structural weakness”) repeats three times; trim would sharpen propulsion, but loop never infects the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Propulsive sentence variety and clean grammar; occasional scaffold loops (“infinite staircase…endless…boundless confinement”) repeat high-concept adjectives without new angle. Mixed metaphors avoided; metaphors are spare, e.g., “sound like shattering glass.” Information density dips in mid-paragraph reflections where equations are named but not dramatized. No line artifacts obstruct rupture clarity, but final beat skips the tactile moment we crave.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; each sentence layers sensory, historical, emotional weight. Occasional elevated register (“testimony to her theory”) edges toward editorial, but fits the protagonist’s scholarly bent. Minor paraphrase echo: “saffron quiet” appears twice without new angle. Otherwise clean; metaphors coherent, no loops. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative layering is dense but patterned—green/ice/bread triad—paid off in final flare. No scaffold loops; one near-paraphrase (“rosewater dread” repeated) forgiven because it accrues thematic resonance. Clean grammar, precise verbs (“pinch,” “knead,” “flaring”).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene beats—short clauses under pressure, longer rolls during revelation. No synonym loops or scaffold strokes. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent; luminous veins work because foreshadowed. One mixed metaphor drift—“sickly, beautiful light”—is minor and does not touch closure. High information density; each sentence advances image or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors musical subject—varied sentence lengths, percussive verbs (“tapping,” “striking,” “rippled”). Only minor artifact: “sketched resonance” appears three times in final third without new inflection, a 0.3 loop. Metaphors stay coherent (sound = weather path). No mixed registers or purple overload; high density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and propulsive; only one paraphrase loop (“pattern language…patterns…patterns” within four lines) docks −0.2. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“sunwashed dread” compresses tone efficiently. No filter-verb stacks. Final line varies sentence length, giving cadence lift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—ivy “clawed” is the single personification—and does not clot the climax. Opening and closing lines frame the mission and its completion with economical symmetry. A few nominalizations (“historical narrative,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly dilute immediacy but never obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with action: long clauses drag through water, staccato snap at seal. Figurative language is spare and grounded—“marble pillars jutted like silent sentinels” is the most ornate, and it works. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold detected; information dual-loads (tool + memory + emotion) in single strokes. Register stays within surveyor’s plausible lexicon; only “hushed blaze” flirts with purple but is earned by sunset context.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythm varied—“Hours passed…”, “A sudden shift…”—with selective sensory nouns replacing modifiers. No loops or paraphrase stacks; few filter verbs; metaphors remain physically coherent (“light like dappled sunlight through water”). One mixed image (“stamp suddenly weighed differently”) is minor. Information density high; each sentence advances premise or image. Copy-errors absent; tense stable; sentence openings varied, giving naturalistic forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, and loop-free; every sentence advances atmosphere or ritual. Metaphors stay coherent (light as memory, paper as vessel) and do not clutter high-pressure beats. Only minor scaffold: “polishing gems with care, his hands moving with the precision of a surgeon” could lose “with care” without loss. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes cleanly; no buried lead or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional fragments that mimic geode pulses. Occasional scaffold—“the hunt led him… the potential pooled”—but information density is high. Metaphors stay coherent. No artifact touches closure; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances vector or resonance. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent with optics/sound. Rhythm varies—long aerial sentences intercut with telemetry fragments. Line-level artifacts absent; closure image “brilliant dimness” is precise, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for ritual (“Each carving held…”) give way to staccato recognition. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“traced,” “dug,” “burned”). Figurative layer disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Only nit: “sieved hush” repeated twice feels slightly self-conscious, but the second instance reweights meaning, so permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template churn. Information multitasks: “antique drawer pull felt warm” marries tactile detail + supernatural hint + motive cue. Mixed metaphors absent; “mist swirled like forgotten ghosts” is singular and apt. Scaffolding minimal; only “as” opener used twice, not clustered. Rhythm escalates into short beats for the hand-off, then exhales with forgiveness line. Clean, propulsive, high-density.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Occasional modifier stacks (“merrily melancholic state,” “flimsy houses of cards”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information density remains high. Metaphors are coherent—utility poles as stars, compass as anchor/albatross—without mixed logic. Minor scaffold: “since the error that cost everything” echoes twice; trimming one would sharpen propulsion. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes: long breathless sentences for descent, staccato for tunnel choice. Mixed metaphors avoided; bioluminescence as “shattered mirrors” is precise. Minor scaffold: “delicately robust” triple-repeat and “baseball ... baseball ... baseball” in close proximity create template thump, but artifacts stop short of the closure beat. Density high—each sentence layers map, memory, or myth—propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, clean grammar, strong rhythmic variation. Occasional elevated phrases (“cosmic intimacy,” “perfume possibility”) flirt with purple but stay aligned with lyric mode. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or ritual step. A single scaffold stem—“she was no longer just…”—is forgivable and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: sentences carry double duty (image + emotional algebra) and paragraph cuts are clean. One scaffold loop appears—“time had grown slippery, sliding…” followed by “sliding through her fingers like the mist”—a paraphrase −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (cloud ≈ time ≈ mist) and do not tangle logic. No artifacts touch closure; final line is spare, earning its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic control: clause lengths ebb and flow with stitching tempo. Information density high—each sentence layers image, backstory, and motion. Minor loops: “recycled” repeats four times in first 200 words; “tears” echoed across paragraphs without new angle. Metaphors largely coherent, but “ghostly resolve written on every line of their face” leans abstract. No artifact touches the final dissolution beat; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ear-test passes; sentence cadence varies, no algorithmic pattern. Figurative language is disciplined—lightning bugs as captured coincidence—avoiding metaphor pile-ups. High density: each sentence advances image or idea; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean copy; only micro-slip is repeated “vibrant hush” (three times) but it functions as deliberate refrain, not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely clean: strong verbs, sensory density, and no synonym loops. Occasional modifiers cluster (“wan glow,” “calm inventiveness”) and one template cadence (“The blackout will end soon,” “The revolution will be silent”)—minor scaffold, not closure-touching. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or intrigue. A few adjectival softeners (“partially,” “merely”) could be excised for tighter propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; sentences layer math, light, and motion without paraphrase loops. Strong verbs: “gripping,” “swirling,” “aligned.” No synonym churn; “stones”/“sequence” repeated only when pattern demands. Metaphors coherent (spiral galaxies, nautilus) and consistent with frictionless physics. No template cadence; openings vary. Minor scaffold: “she believed” and “she finally understood” could compress, but they occupy low-pressure lines. No artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from tidal breath to sphere-release hiss. Clean grammar; pronouns stable.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but storm-themed and taught early, so earns its place. One micro-loop: “verses she could not yet write but sensed somehow” restates the same idea twice—minor. Closing line lands with image, not explanation. Clean enough for 9-territory but for that hairline repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies—long prism-lit clauses alternate with clipped “coded angles” fragments; no template cadence. Information density is high: sunlight, brook, arm, card, student all layered inside 740 words without stall. Metaphors are controlled (“dignified chaos,” “prismatic chaos”) and internally coherent. Only minor scaffold: “the hidden overture revealed itself” could be shown through the arm’s click rather than told; keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates like tempo markings—long lyrical runs for reverie, clipped fragments when the shutdown looms. Figurative language is selective: “melodies flowed like the dreams he could never quite remember” does fresh double work, linking music and amnesia. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances either deadline pressure or emotional revelation. Opening and closing lines act as thematic bookends, recharging the lullaby motif without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose rhythm breathes: long sentence of descent, staccato triple “circles of stones” at reveal. No paraphrase loops; “seed” recurs with evolving modifiers (warm, pulsing, luminous) that track stakes. One mixed metaphor risk—“beast awakening” beside “mist at dawn”—but beasts can emerge from mist, so physics intact. Final line “smiled with luminous doubt” crystallizes tone without overwriting; qualifies for 9+ but for one adverbial cliché “seemed to” earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from languid clauses to clipped whispers; no template cadence runs. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“tides of remembrance” taught as refrain—so payoff justifies lushness. No mixed metaphors; compass needle obeys internal logic. Information density strong: one sentence often layers weather, tool, and emotion. Minor scaffold: “slow-spoken” repeats 3× but serves mantra, so −0.2 only.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and varied sentence structure. However, subtle paraphrase loops appear: “decay was everywhere… but so was the promise” echoes later as “destruction often precedes creation.” The phrase “accumulated dust patterns” repeats without progression, and “gradual change” is named rather than dramatized. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting dulls propulsion in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“refracted,” “scorched,” “amplify”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “scorched testament of the ledger strip” and “drifting resonance of the stars” verge on purple. A paraphrase loop occurs in the final paragraph (“transforming pain and fear into something beautiful and true” echoes earlier lines about transformation). These artifacts don’t obscure causality but dull closure precision slightly, disqualifying 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“unshaken marvels” appears four times, often redundantly) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “translate silence into music” restated verbatim). The phrase “capsize survivor” is used three times as a label rather than integrated action. These artifacts don’t obscure causality but dull momentum and flirt with template cadence, especially in the closing third, disqualifying 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Fish scattered like silver thoughts” does triple duty (image, metaphor, character insight). Figurative language is coherent—light, fracture, stillness recur without muddle. Minor overwriting in “chased stillness that mimicked his own inner landscape” slightly strains logic, but not enough to obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean, with strong verbs (“sustained,” “tightened,” “crystallized”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in two adjacent lines summarizing backstory (“carried by his grandmother…”), and “gently persistent” borders on label-speak. No figurative muddle, but one paraphrase loop (“build intergenerational support that neither regimes nor sanctions could break” / “build intergenerational support that sanctions cannot sever”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; metaphors (“pilgrim of sparks,” “purple waterfalls”) serve theme. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“foggy lucidity,” “tender feelings she had never quite expressed”) risks abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “camera obscura” appears four times with diminishing returns. Final paragraph’s “breathing, of how each inhale…” slightly softens momentum, though closure image redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished (“quaking reverie that shook her to her core while simultaneously opening her mind”). Minor paraphrase loops: “fading photographs” repeated without added pressure. Figurative density is high in peak beats but coherent. Final disintegration beat avoids scaffold—clean, haunting. However, “hyperbolic geometry” is invoked more as incantation than mechanics, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely polished with strong verbs and selective detail, but minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “motivation burned bright” and “staggering grace” repeat as near-motifs with slight abstraction. One paraphrase loop: “patiently strategic had kept her alive… and it would serve her now.” Final paragraph’s “laughter a testament…” edges toward summary. Otherwise, high information density and clean causality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“ashen residue covering everything like snow on a battlefield”) and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“battered marvel of his profession”), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs, and the final lines achieve propulsion through syntactic tightening. Closure image remains uncluttered and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (“luminous disbelief,” “liquid silver light”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs. Minor overwriting appears in the opening (“practiced gaze of a golden-hour portrait thief”)—a touch ornamental—but quickly gives way to propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; the final image lands with clean, resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is vivid but over-ornamented: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence (“droplet falling like a period,” “glow like captured sunlight”), creating density without always advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“abandoned his studio… seeking refuge in this forgotten space” / “not merely abandoning the past; he was transforming its remnants”). The final third avoids artifacts, but elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “manipulation… unlike the thawing heart”) occasionally clashes with glassblowing’s physicality. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm are strong, yet momentum drags under accumulated metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“crouched,” “groaned,” “cradled”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“death-defying leaps,” “ethereal patterns,” “adrenaline-fueled action films”)—figurative density slightly blurs immediacy. No paraphrase loops, but “fabricated identity” and “layers of fabricated identity” verge on synonym churn. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates effectively, though “whole and unbroken” leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ambered hush,” “marbled silence” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphors in action (fingers tracing, candles guttering). Minor overwriting in “veins of different minerals in stone” slightly muddles, but closure beat (“glow with gentle light”) remains clear. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. One near-redundancy (“profound stillness that fell between heartbeats and words” / “ambered hush”) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “crystalline snow” conveys texture, temperature, and fragility in three words. Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato treads versus legato music—with paragraph cuts enhancing visual cadence. Minor overwriting in “looped timelines showing possible futures” slightly blurs causality, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences dull momentum. Final line (“ordinary and extraordinary”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical (“glistening pavement,” “resonant hush”), though occasional overwriting appears (“ambiguously clear in their meaning” borders on redundant). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “cryptic doodles” repeats without variation. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Final line elegantly echoes opening, satisfying read-aloud test without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “The garden was blooming withering” compresses paradox into two words). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One minor artifact: “commemorating another small victory elaborately” slightly over-modifies, but it’s character-consistent. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose—every image serves theme or character. Final line (“gardens truly know their gardeners”) lands cleanly without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“danced,” “pulsed,” “intersecting”). However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “icy warmth coursing through her veins—a mixture of scientific detachment and profound excitement” leans into explanatory abstraction. A paraphrase loop occurs in the final third (“mechanically warm” repeated four times in six paragraphs), dulling immediacy. Sentence openings vary, but figurative density occasionally blurs propulsion (“universe rewards those who challenge conventional wisdom” edges toward platitude).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, varying sentence length to mirror musical cadence. High information density: “water-damaged notes flowed from his memory through his fingers” merges action, memory, and embodiment. One paraphrase loop (“silence that had fallen… hush returned”) and slight overwriting in “ethereal patterns that seemed to shift” prevent 9+; no artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“swung,” “padded,” “smudged”) and specific nouns (“barometers,” “Chugach”) avoid modifier bloat. Rhythm varies effectively, though one brief run of participle openings (“Swinging… Finding… Rising…”) risks monotony. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—auroras as “celestial tears” ties to “auroral sorrow” without muddle. Final line’s paradox (“impossibly light and heavy as mountains”) crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“prickled,” “etched,” “flooded”) and rhythmic control. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in “drowsy alertness” repetitions (three mentions), bordering on scaffold, but never dulls the closure. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the final paragraph’s clarity and cadence earn its resonance without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“reality sliding past like cold silk” conveys sensation, metaphor, and transition). Minor overwriting appears in “crumbling peace of the place resonated with the keeper's own detachment”—slightly abstract for peak beat. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings diversify, and paragraphs breathe with scene needs. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; closure image lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“transformed,” “threading,” “blossoming”) and varied syntax. However, two adjacent sentences paraphrase Maya’s philosophy (“ordinary magic exists in…”)—a scaffold loop costing momentum. Figurative density peaks appropriately at eclipse, though “hush of dreaming roots” slightly muddles logic. Final paragraph avoids purple prose by anchoring emotion in tactile detail (locket, drum, arms).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwrought: “silence had taken on a bronze quality, heavy and resonant, pressing against the eardrums like a remembered sound” stacks modifiers without advancing momentum. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“the historian’s sensitively perceptive nature… allowed them to detect… the historian’s sensitively perceptive mind caught patterns”). Figurative language is coherent but dense in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling propulsion. Final lines land cleanly, though.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical and controlled, with strong verbs (“orchestrate,” “transpose,” “foreclose”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “palimpsest of destinies,” “syntax of fate,” and “grand design of existence” verge on purple abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences in paragraph 5 lean on repetitive structure (“He hadn’t sought… it had emerged… pulling him…”). Final image (“sun rose… smile… see the world differently”) is clear but slightly generic, dulling closure’s edge by 0.3–0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silence so profound it felt like a physical weight” advances atmosphere and character. Figurative language is purposeful (indigo “absorbs light,” stillness “unraveled”), with no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “plumbed the depths… emerged victorious” slightly flattens the climax, but rhythm varies effectively. Final line’s afterimage metaphor ties back to indigo’s light-absorption, closing the sensory loop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and progression. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“vibrations building within and around him”) slightly muddles propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“upturned hush” borders on strained). Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—earned stasis through syntactic breath.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“bruised purple sky,” “shattering glass” fracture) and avoids redundancy. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or character. One paraphrase loop: “fractured timelines... invisible pathways that split and merged” slightly restates the concept. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure beat (“carried with him the knowledge...”) is clear and resonant without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“traced,” “haunted,” “enthrall”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “filament of hush” recurs four times with diminishing returns, and “mirrored hush” echoes without deepening. A paraphrase loop occurs: “soundless world” / “life without volume” / “symphony of silence” approach the same idea across adjacent paragraphs. These artifacts don’t obscure causality but slightly dull the closure’s edge, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“fractured,” “dislodged,” “nurture”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “layered tranquility that covered secrets both personal and political” verges on abstract summary. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase pair (“progressing laterally” repeated).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“molecular structure,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors dawn’s approach—calm, expansive—yet “perpetual reminders of both absence and presence” flirts with abstraction. Still, line-level control remains strong, with high information density and minimal artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“rope… bearing the tension of desperate flight” conveys history, texture, and theme). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language is coherent (starlight “whispers,” rope “pulses”). However, slight overwriting appears in mid-story: “uncovering layers of meaning… subtle shifts… temporal perception” edges toward abstraction. No loops or artifacts, but two adjacent sentences near “liquid time” restate the same idea with minimal pressure gain.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “chronic hush that settled deep in the bones of the land” establishes tone and stakes in one stroke. Figurative language is consistent (sound as vibration, memory as echo) without muddle. Minor scaffold appears in “stories were simple yet profound tales…”—a near-tautology—but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with dream summary, but the last line (“ready to discover the new sounds waiting in the silence”) snaps back to active present, preserving propulsion. No loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “walking the fine line between truth and fabrication” borders on abstraction, and “strange alchemy of science and intuition” risks purple prose. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize the client’s shift (“expression shifting… integrated with her psyche”) rather than dramatizing it, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained and resonant (“invisible threads,” “economy of mutual care”). One slight overwriting moment: “carefully calculated, exuberant compassion” edges toward label-speak, though context earns it. Final line’s musical metaphor (“composition… movement”) is earned by earlier symphony motif.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “volcanic strands seeming to drink the crater’s light and bleed it back” exemplifies high information density. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with scene needs. Minor overwriting in one beat (“luminescent ache” repeated), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—light is consistently consumed, bled, pulsed—and never muddles causality. Final lines resonate without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“water slowed, forming intricate crystal-like patterns as he manipulated their flow through his command of temporality”). Sentence rhythms vary to mirror time distortion. Minor overwriting appears in one beat (“sparkled with memories of sounds not yet created, glimpses of music yet to be played”)—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts in closure; final lines land cleanly with emotional propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “blue as deep water, brown as rich earth” conveys color, metaphor, and emotional valence). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. One paraphrase loop (“fragments of memories, glimpses of possible futures”) and slight overwriting in peak beats (“intense light… smiling as if from a great distance”) prevent 9+. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “sapphire hush,” “delicate as a butterfly wing,” and “kindly methodical grace” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in character perception. Sentences vary rhythmically—staccato for movement, lyrical for memory—without template cadence. One minor paraphrase loop (“forgotten remnants… overlooked for generations”) slightly dulls momentum, but high information density prevails: every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“bridge between their hidden world and the library’s future”) crystallizes theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and mostly concise, with strong verbs (“pinned,” “thrived,” “reconstruct”) and purposeful sensory detail. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “circuits of communication with plants became increasingly sincere,” which verges on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “reluctant metamorphosis” and “sustaining transformation” echo without deepening. Final paragraph’s lyricism lands cleanly, avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “restless oceans and fragmented memories,” “rain trails… carved temporary paths,” “pigments… preserved before the water wars” all multitask. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short clauses for tension, flowing syntax for revelation. One paraphrase loop: “convergence of past and present, nature and human craft, beauty and preservation” edges toward stacked abstraction, though redeemed by immediate action (the voice behind her). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure image (“amber brooch… pulse with quiet significance”) avoids purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “shadows cast... began to overlap in ways that defied the limited light sources” conveys spatial anomaly and thematic inversion in one clause. Figurative language is controlled (“bright darkness” recurs with evolving meaning); no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “steadily unpredictable” repetition (lines 2 and 15), but payoff justifies it. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“blooming like crystalline flowers”) avoids purple prose while crystallizing theme.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “navigated absences had become her specialty” conveys profession, method, and theme). Minor overwriting appears: “pristine but painful emptiness” leans slightly abstract; “seedlings through soil long thought barren” edges toward cliché. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “fragments into meaning” appears verbatim twice. Rhythm varies effectively, though final paragraph’s cadence borders on incantatory.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dissonant harmony that called to him” merges sound/tactile imagery efficiently. Varied syntax avoids monotony; paragraph cuts align with spatial shifts (tunnel → vault → city). Overwriting flares in “constellations he'd never seen pulsed in sequence”—slightly redundant—but peak beats stay clear. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “mapped path at a time” elegantly echoes opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often vivid (“whales swimming in starlit skies”) but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “unheard symphony” appears four times, “forgotten patterns” three, creating a paraphrase loop. The final paragraph stacks abstractions (“transcends explanation,” “vast and interconnected”) that dull the closure’s sensory punch. Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and dense, with high information-per-line (e.g., “colors… shifted more violently, like the final moments of a dying rainbow”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught: light/rainbow motifs evolve into dimensional windows. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; momentum flows cleanly. Slight overwriting in mid-section (“rebels in one reality fought… while in another, entire civilizations collapsed”) risks density without propulsion, but closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “deathly vitality,” “liquefying rigid thinking,” and “mathematics of a fair trade” do thematic and atmospheric work without purple excess. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot, character, or tone. Figurative language is coherent (ink as liquid thought), though one mixed metaphor (“swirled with impossible patterns that seemed to shift her perspective”) slightly blurs causality. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gilded-leaf stationer,” “temporal texture,” “incandescent restraint” all do double duty. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with Elias’s measured focus. One minor flaw: “battered notepad” appears four times—functional but slightly repetitive. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent (hum “refracted into a spectrum”). Closure line (“holding histories both real and imagined”) lands with clarity and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tidal ebb and flow. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“tapestry of human existence”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Figurative language is coherent (palimpsest, sugar dissolving), and the final line recharges the opening image without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift purposefully, and figurative language is coherent (e.g., dust as “miniature galaxies”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “resonant hums that seemed to fill the empty space” verges on redundancy, and “gloomy cheerfulness” is repeated like a motif rather than evolved. No loops or scaffold, but the phrase “reimagining past conversations” leans slightly abstract compared to the otherwise concrete action. Read-aloud rhythm remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“music from a dozen floats clashed while the scent of fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater”). Occasional overwriting in mid-section (“reorganizing the scattered wisdom into strategies”) edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase pair (“partial victory” / “favorable terms”) slightly dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s rhythm masterfully echoes opening, creating charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and generally precise, with strong verbs (“disintegrating,” “crested,” “swirling”) and varied syntax. However, minor redundancy appears: “dawning hush” recurs three times with diminishing effect, and “purposefully curious” feels label-like. The phrase “dawnlit melancholy” repeats near-identically, creating a slight loop. No major artifacts obscure causality, but these repetitions prevent 9+ line-level mastery. Final paragraph’s momentum dips slightly with explanatory closure (“guardian of memories”).

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful—“iridescent wings bent at unnatural angles,” “steam rising from nearby tracks”—with high information density. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“surgical precision,” “neurons bridging an injury”) slightly dilutes immediacy. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports rhythm. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic closure, though one mixed metaphor (“magnetic calm”) risks coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “water droplets arranged themselves in a surprisingly familiar formation” does atmosphere, character insight, and plot work. Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose. One paraphrase loop: “silence here was never truly silent, but filled with...” slightly redundant. Final paragraph’s condensation reprise is earned, not scaffolded. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, especially in the dream-to-awakening transition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“His first footfall landed squarely…”). Figurative language is purposeful—“dusk bled,” “skeletal buildings”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “spiderwebbing backwards into wholeness” slightly strains physics, but the Accumulative lens forgives it. Sentence variety sustains momentum; paragraph cuts heighten cadence (e.g., single-sentence “He smiled…”). No loops or scaffolding; closure line (“humming softly to itself”) perfectly echoes opening hush.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “coalesced,” “uns n arl”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught: “gathered hush” evolves from silence to visible luminescence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“impossibly light yet pregnant with possibility”) risks purple prose, but doesn’t obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or character. Closure image (“time itself had learned to stand still”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “copperlight repose” and “sustained impossibilities” recur with near-identical cadence, creating a slight template rhythm. Two adjacent paragraphs open with “Through the scuffs…” and “In the lighthouse prison…”, risking paraphrase-loop fatigue. Yet information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and the final lines achieve propulsion through rhythmic variation. No clarity loss at closure, but minor scaffold in mid-text dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “lovingly venomous pollen that made the air thick with dreams” advances atmosphere, character history, and stakes in one phrase. Minor overwriting in “winter-cracked fields, their hush broken only by the occasional wind that whispered through dormant stalks” slightly dilutes momentum, but figurative coherence holds (venom/dreams, frost/spirals). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Closure line (“vows exchanged at last in a language only the greenhouse understood”) earns its lyricism through prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“mist curled like sleeping serpents” borders on mixed metaphor with later “dragon spines”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs shift visually with scene beats. Minor scaffold in “she had discovered… she believed… she whispered” sequence, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but precise, avoiding purple excess: “roots snaking between bones in a grotesque yet beautiful dance” balances specificity and lyricism. Sentence variety supports momentum—short clauses during discovery (“It was a sundial base”), flowing syntax during reflection. Minor scaffold in “rebuild because we remember” risks thematic echo but is offset by concrete action (placing final bird piece). No loops or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ebony clipboard hugged tightly,” “ghostly traces,” “bridge between two souls” do triple duty (character, setting, theme). Sentence variety supports rhythm—long descriptive flows punctuated by short urgent clauses (“Today’s task was particularly challenging”). Minor overwriting in “carefully inventive puzzle of linguistic elements” edges toward label-speak, and “sacred spaces of self-invention” flirts with abstraction, but closure remains vivid. No loops or scaffold; every image feeds the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: “prismatic tears,” “adjacent possibilities,” and “echoed silence” carry thematic weight without purple excess. Sentence variety supports momentum—short staccato phrases during crisis (“Her fingers flew”), lyrical flow in reflection. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“threads representing military supply routes with celestial anomalies”) edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors closure’s quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fierce tenderness” recurs as tonal anchor, and metaphors cohere (shard’s cracks = emotional fractures). Minor overwriting in “haunting melodies of the singing spirits that swirled around the twisted roots”—slightly ornate—but never obscures causality. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening while signaling transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “mist-clad atrium,” “anesthetic still smoothing her brow,” “smudged notes… partially obscured” all advance atmosphere, character, and plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—flowing for reflection, staccato for action (“He gently lifted… studying… tracing”). Minor overwriting in “labyrinthine grooves catching the fading light like ancient wisdom” risks mixed metaphor (coral as text/wisdom), but it’s isolated and paid off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves the accumulative drive. Final paragraph’s cadence (“another small graft… another stitch…”) earns its lyricism through earned repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“swallowed,” “coaxing,” “crystallized”) and purposeful imagery. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “liquid dawn,” “miraculous illuminated fragment,” and “fog-bound hearts” edge toward purple prose without full payoff. No paraphrase loops, but “pensive mirth” repeats as a tonal motif without deepening. Sentence openings vary adequately; paragraph lengths support rhythm. Final image (“colors seemed to dance”) resonates but leans on familiar phrasing. Artifact debt prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “brush dancing playfully,” “sound bewitched her senses,” “laughter joined the chorus.” High information density—most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “reflected sound” appears redundantly in adjacent sentences during second awakening. Figurative language is coherent (Russian dolls, gentle rain) but borders on overuse in peak beats—still legible, never muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances world, character, or theme. Syntax varies effectively, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the accumulative design. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., “storm approaches with determined wings”) is consistent and grounded. One near-overreach: “converging chaos” repeats slightly mechanically, but not enough to obscure closure or cause momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is rich but coherent—“reef-shadow joy,” “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind”—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“shyly unstoppable” used twice), creating slight redundancy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final lines achieve propulsion and poise, with the last image (“pinned to the shell’s highest point”) echoing the opening spatial cue, closing the rhythm without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“tears that felt like tiny glass orchids”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “notes colliding like dust motes in sunbeams” borders on decorative—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One slight redundancy: “museum of extinct feelings” repeats unnecessarily. Otherwise, line-level craft supports momentum and closure with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often elegant but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“uns narl,” “interconnected promises,” “symphonies of truth” recur verbatim or near-verbatim across adjacent paragraphs) and conceptual redundancy—e.g., “restore trust after silence” appears four times. Figurative density is high in peak beats without payoff: the inkwell “glows as if encouraging her” introduces magical realism unearned by prior logic. Final third contains paraphrase loops (“paths diverge,” “before paths diverge permanently”) that dull momentum and obscure causal clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“stone tiers... mimicked the dormant volcano’s ancient heartbeat” establishes setting, rhythm, and metaphor). However, “dappled resolve” recurs three times with diminishing returns, bordering on scaffold. “Slyly heartfelt” appears twice as label without behavioral demonstration. Final paragraph’s “dappled resolve through the corridors” risks paraphrase-loop with earlier uses. Otherwise, syntax varies, verbs are strong (“clutched,” “traced,” “converged”), and technical terms feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“slow decay bloomed in her senses”), though occasional figurative stacking (“cosmic dust of her yesterdays”) edges toward overwriting. Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports momentum, and every line advances atmosphere or character. Minor redundancy in “fragments emerged like stubborn dust motes refusing to be swept away” slightly dulls propulsion, but closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“movements as light as dust motes… yet as determined as rivers”) is coherent and fresh. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“patterns she traced with reverence… ancient runes”) borders on redundancy but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors resolution—no loops, no scaffold, just clean, resonant propulsion to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ruste d equipment suspended in time,” “living stars,” “luminous respite.” Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shared exhale escaping her lips”) edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “profound simplicity of belonging that woven together water, stars…” slightly muddles syntax, but propulsion remains strong. Closure image is sharp, not dulled by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“sadness and acceptance waltzing”) is coherent and fresh, never purple. Minor paraphrase risk in “before memory fades” repetitions, but they’re motif-driven, not scaffold loops. Sentence variety supports momentum; final lines land with rhythmic precision. No artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong information density—e.g., “prick the bubble of routine” conveys mission and metaphor in five words. Sentence variety supports pacing, and paragraph cuts align with beat shifts. Minor flaw: slight overwriting in “liquid mirror”/“stars above… winked” constellation imagery risks purple prose. No loops or scaffold, but one register slip: “mechanical smile” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tides, gaps, light) and pays off in the inscription climax. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“spaces between thoughts, silences between words...”) edges toward redundancy, but rhythm sustains momentum. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Closure image is sharp, though one mixed metaphor (“threads of luminous ink”) slightly blurs tactile clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful, with high information density—each image serves theme or character. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with contemplative pacing. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: e.g., “seeing—truly seeing” followed by “seeing clearly what was always there” risks synonym churn. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final third avoids artifacts, though “vessels of meaning and beauty” leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional ebb and flow. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “granite-hard grief,” “celestial indifference,” and repeated metaphors of fracture verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally edges toward purple—yet never obscures closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; figurative language (“soap bubble,” “serene upheaval”) serves the Accumulative lens without muddling causality. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“dance of serene upheaval,” “celestial bodies aligning”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence variety sustains momentum, though two adjacent lines (“Each element... Each pattern...”) flirt with template cadence. Final paragraph’s bioluminescent algae payoff justifies earlier sensory buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“cartographer moved with practiced silence,” “ink smudged by a hurried hand”). Minor scaffold appears in the summary-like transition to the lab (“Back at her laboratory...”). One paraphrase loop: “resonances that persisted long after footsteps faded” / “echoes that suggested hidden chambers.” Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no muddle—but the final paragraph leans slightly abstract (“give voice to the silent witnesses”).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “Water conducted energy differently” advances world logic, character knowledge, and atmospheric tension. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mirrors as portals, heartbeat as bond) and never muddled. Minor redundancy appears in “possibilities beyond what ordinary eyes could perceive” / “paths unwritten, loves unexplored”—near-paraphrase—but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety sustains momentum; final paragraph’s “vanished… until spring called” echoes opening with earned resonance. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains pristine even in lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “scuffed against weathered stone” conveys history, wear, and place in five words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “flawed beauty” appears twice in closing beats, slightly dulling resonance. Figurative language is controlled—celestial bodies “dance,” shadows are “strange”—but never muddled. Final line’s lyricism (“life persisted...”) earns its weight without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “crystalline wasteland” and “fractured grace” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but not enough to blur sense. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Final image (“listened for birdsong that would never come… heard it anyway”) achieves poetic clarity without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density—e.g., “snowflakes caught in her hair like diamante witnesses” conveys image, symbol, and emotional weight. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “bodily poetic form,” “harvest of echoes,” and “prism sanctuary” recur with near-synonym variation (“threads of fate,” “silvery strands”), creating mild scaffold loops. No clarity loss at closure, but minor overwriting prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings. However, recurring phrases (“half-lit epiphany,” “uncommonly serene,” “meteor hush”) verge on scaffold loops—used three times each with minimal variation. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Momentum dips slightly in reflective passages, but compression remains strategic. One paraphrase loop: “reverse the narrative power dynamics” / “reverse another dominant narrative.”

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“living tapestry of orange and black,” “smoke in the wind”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“verdant grotto above the clouds” slightly redundant). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor figurative density in the dusk paragraph risks slight opacity but pays off in closure. Momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “snowmelt ardor,” “technically gentle,” “transcribed in light” fuse concept and image. Sentence variety supports momentum—longer during descent, clipped during braid work. One minor flaw: “faded forms of names already lost to time” slightly abstract for peak beat. Otherwise, zero loops, high propulsion, and figurative coherence (light/ice/memory motifs never contradict).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“nature had slowly reclaimed what humanity had abandoned” conveys setting, theme, and backstory). Sentence variety supports momentum, though a few adjacent clauses verge on paraphrase (“seeing only what had been and what would be, never what is” echoed later). Figurative language is coherent (storm = mental turbulence, dust motes = spirits), but “sugar in water” simile slightly flattens the transcendence beat. No scaffold loops or artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“scraped,” “uncloak,” “unfolded”) and selective sensory detail (cool tile, amethyst twilight, ink conservation). Sentence structures shift purposefully—fragmented urgency during ritual, flowing cadence in reflection. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “mathematics so perfect it seemed divine” flirts with abstraction, and “encrypted devotion” appears twice as thematic label. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“empirically ironic faith” echoes earlier phrasing) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs and concrete nouns (“knitting together with impossible elegance”). However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “cellular structure responding to this fundamental shift” edges into diagnostic label-speak. A paraphrase loop occurs in describing the music box’s reappearance (lines 12–14 vs. 28–30). Sentence variety is good, but the final paragraph’s cadence leans slightly ornamental. Closure image remains clear despite these hairline artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“crystallizing the mist into delicate patterns on his windowpanes” conveys time, setting, and mood). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “luminous butterfly of starlight and mathematics” borders on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold; rhythm supports propulsion. Final paragraph slightly risks abstraction (“windows that showed not just reflections but possibilities”), but closure image redeems it. No filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “lush orchard spanning its rafters like vines on forgotten architecture” establishes setting, metaphor, and theme in one breath. Sentences vary rhythmically (fragments for impact: “Breathing in the sweet scent…”; complex for reflection), and information multi-tasks (the bag “carried for years but never opened” implies history and hesitation). Minor overwriting in “deciduous vows flittered through her mind now—promises made and fallen away like autumn leaves”—slightly redundant—but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“growing stronger with each generation that tends it”) resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“the universe both laughed and wept”), but rhythm varies effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; sentences advance atmosphere and concept. However, peak beats rely heavily on abstraction (“collapse of stars,” “forbidden understanding”) over concrete sensation, slightly muddying closure impact. Final paragraph’s cadence powerfully echoes opening blossoms.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“traced,” “reshaped,” “woven”) and varied syntax. Occasional overwriting (“mercurial library spaces where books lived and breathed”) slightly muddles peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “unheard symphony” repeats without deepening its function. Final paragraph’s cadence effectively echoes opening motifs with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “blissfully aberrant,” “trapped freedom,” and “unkindled solace” recur with earned weight. Sentence variety supports momentum—longer cadences for memory immersion, shorter for decisive moments (“She descended below deck”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“a hundred stories, a thousand names, a multitude of forgotten lives”) borders on stacked modifiers but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line’s echo of “drifting” recharges the opening with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and purposeful. Sentences vary in structure and length, matching scene rhythm (e.g., short clauses during rope manipulation). High information density: “three strands intersecting at seven points” conveys both visual and narrative data. One paraphrase loop: “translate confusion into clarity” appears twice verbatim, slightly reducing freshness. No figurative muddle or scaffold clutter; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “bloom of hush,” “hammered repose” fuse concept and image without purple excess. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor artifact: slight synonym churn around “resonance”/“harmony” in mid-text, but no loops or scaffold. Closure beat remains clear—stone’s hue shift conveys integration without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “glass humming pavilion,” “shard of hush,” and “thistle-blown hope” carry thematic weight without overwriting. Sentences vary in length and structure, matching emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. One minor slip: “rekindled beacon, a harmony of past and future” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by the concrete image preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but precise: “memories dripping like the rain,” “shadows converged in a pattern like a signature” avoid mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“Elthion stood…”, “The quills he used…”, “Below him…”), and paragraphs shift length to mirror descent from sky to earth. Minor overwriting in “preemptively nostalgic heart aching” leans toward label-speak, but momentum holds. Closure beat (“ensuring that even after fog becomes solid…”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves accumulation (“petals unfurling in anticipation,” “gold that danced with playful seriousness”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“purple that sang, green that whispered”) risks slight muddle but pays off tonally. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent descriptions of color effects edge toward redundancy (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density—e.g., “the diaries she filled contained not just observations but the silences between creatures.” However, minor paraphrase loops appear: “fragile ecosystem through the changes” / “constantly shifting… yet maintaining”; “foresee the patterns” / “foresee a new approach.” Figurative language is consistent (cicada = metamorphosis, pools = transition), but the phrase “texture of time” repeats four times, verging on motif overuse. Final paragraph’s cadence slightly stalls with stacked abstractions (“uncertainties, pauses, and unexpected transformations”).

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence openings vary (“The bunker builder’s child…”, “Only her tiny porcelain doll…”, “Tomorrow would be different…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “intangibly tangible quality, something that could be felt in the soul but never truly captured” borders on redundant abstraction. The phrase “sprout new awareness” slightly muddles the botanical metaphor established by “seedling.” These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences often advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously (“The drifting prism terrace responded to his touch…”). Figurative language is consistent—silence is “vaulting,” crystals are “fortunetellers”—without mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“sonic landscape for healing that few would notice but many would feel”), slightly bloating a beat. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, and the final line echoes the opening train whistle with resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“digital fruits that glowed with the warmth of remembered sunlight”), but occasional overwriting dilutes momentum: “weathered by years of handling ancient artifacts” is redundant after establishing her role. Minor scaffold in “methodically work through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals beneath”—could be tighter. No loops or artifacts, but two adjacent sentences restate the ruby’s glow intensifying, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“memories turned to ash,” “cold as forgotten promises”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (ash/shadow/substance motifs) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “starlight gave way to dawn through the opening between their worlds” slightly softens impact, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“pulsed,” “thrums,” “crystallized”) and purposeful figurative language. Sentences modulate length to match scene needs. One paraphrase loop: “quantum promise” described twice in near-identical terms (lines 14 and 20). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum remains taut. Final paragraph’s “unlikely stage for Maya’s quantum redemption” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by the concrete image of glittering diamonds.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraphing. However, recurring phrases like “eloquently silent” and “bridge of intuition” verge on label-looping, and figurative density occasionally overwhelms propulsion (e.g., “golden shadows danced… casting long, warm fingers”). The final third avoids major artifacts, but the repeated use of “resonance” and “truth” edges toward thematic redundancy. Still, line-level craft largely serves atmosphere and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Dust rose like tiny spirits when he opened it” conveys action, atmosphere, and reverence). Rhythm varies effectively, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“shivering bliss washed over him… profound cold and transcendent warmth”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (lock releasing, transparent pages). Final line resonates without redundancy, recharging “whispered allegiances” from earlier. One slight register drift (“factually mystical”) edges toward abstraction but is grounded by context.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is precise and evocative (“radiating circles around the button,” “unfurred not just one man’s history”). High information density: each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One slight overwriting: “accumulated dust patterns of countless files” borders on abstraction, but closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “unraveled,” “slipped”) and sensory precision. Minor redundancy in “carefully resourceful rebel” (label + action) and one paraphrase loop (“fragments of realized memories before they vanished” / “erased histories”). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “tyranny of indifference… like fog” slightly clashes with the metallic/liquid motifs. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, landing cleanly on the key’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but over-reliant on repeated figurative phrasing (“quietly vivid,” “vested hush,” “eerie nostalgia”) creating near-synonym loops. Sentence openings vary, but high-pressure beats suffer from stacked modifiers (“mist-shrouded atrium,” “crystalline structure catching fragments of light”). No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally blurs propulsion—e.g., three consecutive lines describing light refraction without advancing action. Final paragraph avoids summarization, landing cleanly on earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“slumbering beast breathing,” “swirling light”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “mossy delight of discovery” slightly strains register, but no loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without redundancy. Information density remains high, though one near-duplicate (“transformed always… becoming and unbecoming”) nudges toward paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“cascading,” “pulsed,” “tucked”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though a few adjacent lines paraphrase (“frustration… constant companion, like a shadow”). One mixed metaphor: “ashes of his failed repairs” then “ashes of his rigid thinking”—conceptually linked but slightly repetitive. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing cleanly on the compass’s dance as life itself.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density—most lines advance character, theme, and atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“steam rising like a ghostly sigh,” “golden seam in his broken heart”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“fractured purpose” / “broken heart”; “luminous regret” repeated) creating mild synonym loops. No syntactic monotony, but “rain-washed” appears three times—functional yet slightly redundant. Closure image remains sharp despite minor scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“cowered,” “flickering,” “crystallizing”) and selective metaphor. Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“pockets heavy with whispered regrets”) borders on purple but serves voice. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or texture. Closure beat (“shimmering light that drifted upward”) is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs and concrete nouns (“pewter warmed,” “bark glowing faintly”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “avalanche of memory” followed by “automatic trauma responses” restates cause/effect without added pressure. Figurative language is consistent (pain as geography, light as truth), but “ultraviolet penance” borders on mixed metaphor—penance implies volition, yet Kai is passive initially.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“unfasten,” “resonating,” “flood”) and varied sentence openings. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “elusively tangible” repeats three times, and phrases like “eternal instant” verge on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally slows propulsion (e.g., “dreamscape suspended between childhood and now”). Closure image remains clear despite minor embellishment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“wisps of spiritual energy leaked like steam”) is coherent and recurring. Only slight overwriting in mid-section (“crumbling façade where wisps…”) and one paraphrase loop (“weightless burden” repeated without variation). Final paragraph’s ticking echo delivers clean propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“ink of impossible realities,” “dendritic frost patterns”) and varied syntax that propels momentum. Figurative language is coherent—light “shifted like breath,” words “swirling like golden leaves”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“characters from languages never spoken… glowing luminescence”) slightly slows beat, but no loops or scaffold. Closure image (“patterns reforming in morning frost”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (Time as golden dust, storm as rippling moments) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“chaotic, beautiful tapestry” borders on ornamental), but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. High information density without momentum loss; the final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative density increases with stakes without muddling cause/effect. Minor overwriting appears in early description (“symphony of echoes that lingered like perfume”), but peak beats avoid mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentence variety supports momentum, though two adjacent lines (“He wasn't mending... bridge between worlds”) verge on paraphrase-loop. Closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “polished obsidian reflecting the stars that would never reach it”). Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive; metaphors cohere (water as knowledge, compass as inner guide). Minor scaffold in “hinged awakening” repetition, but payoff justifies it. Final paragraph’s cadence (“breathed deeply, and smiled”) earns its lyricism without purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often evocative, but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“reimagine,” “layered meanings,” “perpetually learning”) and conceptual redundancy—e.g., “reimagine her understanding… through layered meanings” followed by “reimagine not just the archway, but her place…” Multiple sentences restate the same insight with slight variation, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, elevated diction (“timewoven alliances,” “scaffold complexity”) clashes with the driftwood sculptor’s likely lexicon. Final paragraph tightens well, but mid-story momentum sags under explanatory weight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “leaves danced outside like scattered embers” conveys season, motion, and mood in one image. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“umbral tenderness of the cathedral at night” borders on label-speak), and two adjacent sentences near the climax paraphrase the revelation. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally risks muddle. Final paragraph propels forward without redundancy, earning strong mid-9s despite slight ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “volcanic glass, each piece a potential word” does triple duty (setting, character, theme). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in “searing reverie of teargas” and “chromatic memories”—slightly strained modifiers. No paraphrase loops, but “truth in tension” recurs as near-synonym churn. Closure beat remains clear despite elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished but exhibits mild overwriting: adjacent lines restate ideas (“physical restoration alone could never truly revive… life support without actual life”), and phrases like “beating heart of true community” verge on cliché. Sentence variety holds, and rhythm supports mood, yet the final paragraph accumulates abstract nouns (“connection,” “meaning,” “shared purpose”) that dull tactile immediacy. No fatal artifacts, but density dips in thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“whisper of history etched in stone,” “essence of the speaker's soul”)—figurative language borders on ornamental without advancing causality. No loops or scaffolding, but two adjacent lines restate the prophecy’s impact (“downfall… guardians would fail”), triggering a small paraphrase penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language (“dancing shadows,” “captured fireflies,” “inverted tree”) coheres within an icy-botanical register. Minor overwriting in “universe of contained possibilities” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence—“fragile and yet eternal”—resonates without sentimentality. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“sky met the peaks like a whispered promise,” “bronze tongue sensitive to atmospheric changes”) and avoids purple excess. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the solstice hush, and paragraphs cut meaningfully. Minor overwriting in “chaotic dance of weather systems” leans slightly cliché, and “credulously curious” risks label-speak—but immediately grounded by action. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “ethereal痕迹” (untranslated Chinese character) breaks immersion, and phrases like “primal elegance of existence in its rawest form” verge on abstraction. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“transforming, their light not dying but rebirthing”). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports mood. No scaffold loops, but minor register inconsistencies in peak beats prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “sunlight fractured through cracked glass domes” conveys setting, mood, and decay simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “dance of mutual dependence that transcended mere pollination”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded by tactile details (warm glass, rusted extractors). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat (“dissolving into moon-bleached air”) is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (“numbers changed meaning during the Great Reckoning”). Figurative language is purposeful (“leaking moments like water”) and consistent. One paraphrase loop: “texture of time passing” recurs verbatim three times, slightly dulling impact. Final paragraph’s cadence swells effectively, though “infinite possibilities beyond measured time” flirts with abstraction. No scaffold or momentum loss; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative density increases with thematic pressure without muddling clarity. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“harmonizing discord - finding the music in crashing waves…”), where abstraction slightly dulls immediacy. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and key images carry multiple functions. No loops or scaffold, though one adjacent paraphrase (“incomplete… fragments… cracks”) nudges redundancy. Closure lines are taut and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “copper wire... became a language” compresses concept and action. Sentence openings vary (“Returning...”, “That night...”, “For the first month...”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “symphony of light and growth” slightly muddles peak beat, but figurative logic holds. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“spring petals cascaded around its base like celestial confetti” establishes setting, mood, and thematic tone), but occasional overwriting intrudes: “amplifying its bronze quiet” borders on mixed metaphor, and “whispered invitations from his own future” leans abstract. No loops or scaffold, yet three adjacent sentences use “as” constructions mid-story, creating mild cadence drag. Final paragraph’s “cleansing the world outside as understanding cleansed Elian’s mind” risks parallelism cliché, though rhythm recovers in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “seeds hitting earth was like a soft language of hope”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though minor scaffold appears (“he worked methodically… moving beyond…”). No loops or artifacts in closure. One mixed metaphor: “narrow vastness” strains logic but serves theme. Overall, momentum never sags; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“jigsaw puzzle of desiccated earth,” “mechanical breathing of the community”) with high information-per-line. Rhythm shifts with scene needs—longer sentences for memory, shorter for movement. Minor overwriting in “tinted revelations” phrase (used thrice), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“gift and a curse,” “blessed pariah… invaluable yet shunned”), creating mild redundancy loops. Figurative language is lush but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Final beat avoids scaffold, yet minor synonym churn (“resilience,” “testament,” “guide”) slightly dulls propulsion in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied (“sky too green, too vast, too full of impossible constellations”), with strong verbs (“frayed,” “retracted,” “emanated”). Occasional overwriting (“sacredly playful determination in his eyes”) edges toward label-speak, and the chess metaphor borders on repetitive. No scaffold loops or tense errors; momentum flows cleanly upward. Final paragraph’s warmth avoids sentimentality by anchoring in sensory detail (“bronze and intricate,” “golden light”).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “footsteps spelling ‘remember,’” “fire had consumed her home and family,” “pulsed with the life force of all its missing companions.” Figurative language is controlled, not overwhelming. Minor redundancy in “benevolently… ruthlessly” phrasing recurs, but not disruptively. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mercury glass as shield, thunder as promise) and pays off cohesively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are sharp. Slight overwriting in the rotunda climax (“pure light,” “tapestry woven with threads”) risks purple prose but remains legible. Sentence openings vary naturally; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and purposeful—most lines multitask (e.g., “fingers fidgeted productively” establishes trait, history, and present action). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“misleading memories that had accumulated like dust”) edges toward cliché but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts align with pressure shifts. One paraphrase loop (“woven hush… magical silence… suffocating blanket”) slightly dulls the artifact, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but suffers minor overwriting: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“refract a single truth into many shimmering perspectives” / “words, like light, could bend, split”), and metaphors occasionally stack (“mist curled around them like listening spirits” followed by “canyon itself seemed to breathe”). Final third avoids artifacts, and sentence variety supports momentum. Information density is high, though a few lines tell rather than dramatize (e.g., “Her defiance had drawn attention…”).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “corrosive emerald waters,” “heated wax” reality, “dire enchantment” all advance atmosphere and theme. Sentence openings vary (“Marcel pressed…”, “The tiny brass…”, “Uncertainty had been…”), and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “frayed tapestry… stitch by painstaking stitch” echoes “quilting memories” without added pressure. Figurative language is coherent (no mixed metaphors), though “kintsugi intentions” leans abstract mid-peak.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“barnacles clustered… sea salt crystals had formed a natural frame”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “fading memories” appears twice in close proximity. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “temporary eternity” risks conceptual overreach. Final beat avoids purple prose, landing cleanly on action (“brush moved with certainty”).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “cork that purified intentions” conveys function, mystery, and theme in five words. Minor overwriting in “screaming tenderness” risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate embodiment (tears, warm vial). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors dawn’s quiet spread—warmth “like a quiet sunrise”—tying syntax to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “patina bronze censer foot,” “waxing and weaker during the waning,” “blinking in recognition” all advance character, setting, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor redundancy (“fluctuates with moon phases” stated twice), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent (navigation as cartography of grief) and never muddled in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“clung stubbornly,” “occlude,” “recalibrating”) and rhythmic control. One paraphrase loop: “sanctuaries for those like Elara who could no longer control what they felt” followed by “involuntary truthfulness” slightly redundant. Figurative density is high but coherent—“arthritic fingers,” “frozen lightning”—though “fractured grace” borders on label-speak. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“moon-bleached bone,” “iridescent haze”) but avoids purple overload. Sentences vary in structure and length, creating rhythmic propulsion. One minor flaw: “softly persistent borrowed memories” leans slightly abstract, though quickly grounded in sensory fragments. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances character, atmosphere, or mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dust that coated his shelves was a testament to solitude” conveys setting, character, and theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with momentum. Minor overwriting in the cavern description (“phosphorescent flowers carpeted stone walls like stars”) borders on ornamental but pays off in the projection scene. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every image serves escalation or closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports the accumulative drive without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, high information density (“fingers finding purchase on razor-sharp rocks”), and rhythmic propulsion that mirrors ascent and revelation. Figurative language is mostly coherent—“lacy menace,” “bleeding starlight”—though “cosmic threads fell like luminescent tears” risks mixed metaphor. One paraphrase loop: “disenchanted monarch had grown tired… seeking meaning beyond ceremonial duties” echoes redundant dissatisfaction. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure image (“embers in the grotto entrance”) is sharp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pocket-suns—miniature spheres of captured light and heat—hummed softly…” conveys object, function, and mood). Minor overwriting appears in adjacent metaphors (“time compressed and expanded,” “twilight deepening and brightening”) that verge on simultaneity strain, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; every image feeds closure. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“snow sometimes fell upside down,” “mosaic of possibilities”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence, though occasional overwriting appears (“terrifying beauty of their own mortality etched in stone”). No scaffold or template cadence; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final paragraph’s auditory metaphor (“scratches… like mountain streams”) ties sound to setting with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally precise and evocative (“breathed the world through scents,” “mapping emotional terrain through the precision of gears”), with strong verbs and concrete nouns. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “humanizing the small object through her touch” edges into explanatory telling, and “occluded views” risks abstraction. No syntactic monotony or loops, but one paraphrase loop exists (“steady rhythm” used twice near end). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“parchment blank as newly fallen snow,” “vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding purple excess. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in two adjacent lines (“luminescent liquid… trimmed tip perfectly suited”), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, closing the breath motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins” merges setting, theme, and mood economically. Figurative language is consistent (glass, music, scent motifs) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “unsaid words and unshed tears” leans slightly abstract, but rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence (“sealing away… until next time”) closes with earned restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“contradictory truths swirled… creation and destruction…”), slightly muddying focus, but peak beats remain clear. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“resounding hush of completion”) is sharp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“razor edges refracting light,” “silence itself had layers”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence rhythms accelerate during the counting sequence, then settle into cadenced wisdom. Minor overwriting in “eminently peculiar task that few understood but all respected”—the adverb feels slightly ornamental. Otherwise, high information density: every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s aphorisms (“Give them silence…”) risk abstraction but are anchored by the whistle-blowing ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density: “quiet wildfire, burning without smoke” conveys embodied emotion and thematic weight in one image. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve cadence shifts (e.g., short punch before dawn arrival). Minimal loops—only slight redundancy in “permeable barrier” phrasing. Figurative language is coherent (fire, light, boundaries) and never muddled. One near-scaffold: “revolutionize her understanding… revolutionize not just intrusion detection…”—but not severe enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “leather shoes still damp” conveys setting, time, and mood in five words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor slip: “catalogued between lecture notes” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded by “weighted dice.” No loops or scaffold; every image pulls weight. Figurative language (“irony followed her like a personal shadow”) is consistent and purposeful. Final paragraph’s propulsion toward “peace” is seamless, with no purple prose muddying the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is evocative and largely precise, with strong verbs (“snaking,” “sweating,” “humming”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “cultivated estrangement from the world above wasn’t accidental but carefully maintained” edges toward explanatory redundancy. The phrase “melodically haunted” borders on label-speak but is redeemed by later embodiment. No fatal loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the end (“The wrong number friendships continued… each one a testament…”) verge on paraphrase. Momentum remains strong, and the final line resonates without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (e.g., “joy and sorrow entwined like stems”). Minor overwriting in “ghost of satisfaction amidst the anxiety of transformation” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening while reconfiguring stakes. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“steep,” “sealed,” “surrendered”) anchoring abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Archie Vesuvius III…”, “His laugh…”, “Yet behind…”), and paragraph lengths create rhythmic contrast. Minor overwriting appears in “polite anarchy of his operation,” a near-label that slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscures causality. The final line’s resonance (“grateful to him though they’d never know his name”) lands cleanly, free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density (e.g., “platinum compass ring... grew warm against his skin as it absorbed the forest's silent language”). Minor overwriting appears in the climax: “understanding, compassion, wisdom beyond words, the very essence of emotion distilled” risks stacked abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences near the end restate the internal compass idea with slight redundancy. Rhythm varies effectively, and the final line (“quiet blaze kindled within his soul”) powerfully echoes the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “dried-up fountain pen... held power” conveys object, history, and stakes). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“twisted ribbons,” “thresh meaning”) and pays off in the closure. Minor redundancy in “confidence and uncertainty” phrasing appears twice but doesn’t obscure causality; no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final line’s “strange comfort” echoes the opening anomaly, creating resonant propulsion without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density (“mapping the unspoken words that hung in the salt-tinged air like invisible threads”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“joyful sorrow” repeated three times), slightly diluting propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“gave voice to the wordless while knowing he would remain wordless”) nudges score down.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ashes of her past” conveys backstory and emotion). Sentence variety avoids monotony, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting: “volcanic tenderness” appears thrice, bordering on motif repetition without deepening. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “faded tapestry fragment” recurs with slight redundancy. Closure image remains sharp despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but purposeful—figurative language serves the sonic-textural motif without muddling causality. Minor overwriting in “notes becoming flowers of light, harmonies growing into trees” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies effectively. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its weight by crystallizing the central metaphor without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “boots splashing in puddles,” “hum with an eerie resonance,” “acoustic highways” all advance atmosphere and plot. Sentence variety supports momentum; no scaffold or loops. Minor overwriting in “arcane ritual” slightly strains metaphor, but doesn’t blur clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence (“cool to the touch… waiting for the next challenge”) lands with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension”) is consistent and payoff-driven, not decorative. Minor redundancy in “patterns within patterns, stars within stars” slightly dilutes momentum, but rhythm varies effectively—paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats. Final lines land with clean propulsion, and the dental mirror’s transformation from tool to key feels earned, not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“crept,” “pulsed,” “cradling”) and selective figurative language. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “forests of second thoughts” repeats three times, and phrases like “magnetic grotto” and “cobalt light” verge on decorative without always advancing pressure. One paraphrase loop occurs: “questions, alternatives, and the beautiful chaos of human creativity” restates the prior sentence’s idea. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character or atmosphere (“strength and fluid motion… woven into the fabric of her being”). Figurative language is purposeful—“liquid moonlight,” “salt sugar”—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “heart a battlefield of hope and fear” edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by immediate physicalization (“trembling fingers”). No loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Closure image (“dreams and reality seamlessly merge”) risks abstraction but is anchored by preceding concrete dissolution of scrimshaw.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery—wood curls “falling with significance,” turbines slicing sky “into rhythmic sections”—but avoids purple excess. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraphs shift purposefully between action, reflection, and description. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: “layers of expectation, layers of enforced sincerity” and “smiling, frowning, weeping, laughing” verge on templated cadence. The phrase “theater of existence” and repeated “remade hush” border on motif overuse, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “lantern-moth hush” appears three times, verging on motif-loop; “dissolving boundaries” repeats without evolution. Figurative density is high in climactic beats (“becoming part of it,” “tapestry of interconnected moments”) but risks blurring clarity. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional arc, yet phrases like “aesthetically driven soul rejoiced” lean into label-speak. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold in closing paragraph dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information yield per line (e.g., “concertina reed tongue tucked into her sleeve” conveys object, placement, and narrative weight). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and figurative language is purposeful (“trapped sliver of phoenix fire”). Minor overwriting in “wilted petals and vibrant leaves into patterns only she could fully comprehend” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Final lines achieve lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“dust motes danced like tiny spirits” earns its metaphor through context. Minor overwriting appears in “artificial pilgrimage through the acoustic landscape of human history,” slightly abstract for peak beat. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts serve emotional shifts, and the final lines resonate without redundancy. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “curtains of intention shimmered between worlds” conveys metaphysics economically. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with thematic rhythm. However, two adjacent sentences paraphrase (“Her creations were genuinely artificial… they carried genuine comfort”), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Figurative language is consistent (phoenix, bloom, withering), but “subdued ardor” risks label-speak. Closure beat remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“traced,” “creaked,” “intensifying”) and varied sentence openings. However, minor overwriting appears: “miniature world reflecting the turmoil” borders on mixed metaphor, and “steadily curious” repeats as label-like descriptor. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “predictable yet surprising conclusions” slightly muddles logic. Final paragraph’s “universe of possibility” risks abstraction, yet momentum holds through concrete action (tea, shared work).

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “atoms of nostalgia were said to reside… steadily unpredictable” conveys lore, rule, and tension). Figurative language is controlled—no purple overload—and metaphors cohere (light/memory, bronze/time). Minor scaffold: “anguished joy” repeats three times, verging on motif but slightly redundant. Final paragraph avoids artifact; closure image (“smiled through tears”) earns its weight. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though one run of participle phrases slows momentum mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “petal-soft leaves rustled against shelves holding humanity’s collected dreams” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shadows as origami, stone as bridge) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “haunting intentionality visible in each movement”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“where dreams were shared and shadows sometimes found freedom”) resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, though occasional overwriting appears (“quietly vivid display of nature's artistry,” “shimmering stillness”). The phrase “fragile convictions” repeats with minimal variation, creating a faint paraphrase loop. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph lengths support rhythm. However, the density of figurative language in reflective beats slightly blurs propulsion, costing full high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “meteor hush,” “displaced miracle,” “tunnel between worlds” carry thematic weight without purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor flaw: slight overuse of metaphor clusters in mid-story (“frosted hourglass… displaced miracle… scars… spirals”) risks density overload, but payoff justifies accumulation. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors stack (“quantum archive,” “cathedral,” “untended gardens”) without always clarifying. Minor paraphrase loops exist—e.g., “forgotten lyrics searched for their tune” appears twice with slight variation, functioning as motif but bordering on redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, peak beats suffer slight register drift (“psychometry reading,” “silver halide crystals”) that edges toward diagnostic diction, though not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“celestial hues of blue and green casting dancing shadows across her moonstruck face” leans decorative), and one paraphrase loop exists (“trapped creativity… prisoner behind bars… ice in her creative channels”). Still, line-level propulsion remains strong, with zero scaffolding or momentum drag near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (“fractured lullaby,” “living data… sang with silent voices”) without muddle. Minor redundancy appears in “glowing dune in bloom” (repeated thrice), slightly dulling momentum, but not enough to obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line’s sprouting seed delivers earned propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “copper needles,” “solar-panel leaves,” and “rotating silver bark” each convey species, material, and function in few words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum (“wild frontier of his mind” repeated verbatim), and “probable miracles” edges toward label-speak, but propulsion remains strong through tactile verbs (“uncurled,” “pulsed,” “shimmer”).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical but avoids overwriting; figurative language is pattern-taught (mist, stars, lullaby) and pays off. Minor scaffold in “gentle persistence of tides that never cease their pull” slightly echoes later “gentle persistence that defined them,” but not enough for loop penalty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One near-redundancy: “veiled ridgeway” and “ridgeway” in adjacent sentences, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“frostbitten hope—not the vibrant joy… but something fragile”). Figurative language is coherent (silence woven into foundation, tears through dust) and peaks without muddle. Minor scaffold in “he remained crouched… fascinated” slightly dulls immediacy, but closure beat (“singing, as snow… danced”) earns its lyricism. No loops, register drift, or syntactic monotony; rhythm breathes with emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ink that shimmered with the memory of what once was and what might yet be” does triple duty (character, object, theme). Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional stacked modifiers (“diminutive titan moved with purposeful silence”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves the central motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “digital coastlines bled across paper ones like watercolors left in the rain” merges image, theme, and emotion. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with thought cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “periodically eternal” repetition (three times), bordering on scaffold, but it’s thematically justified. No loops or simultaneity errors; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s propulsion matches the story’s accumulative drive without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “thunderous serenity,” “resonated with something deep inside her,” “revolution of the spirit” verge on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“broken ships and broken dreams,” “past and future, despair and hope”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density peaks in the climax without payoff—metaphors accumulate without clarifying stakes. No fatal artifacts, but slight inflation dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“pressed,” “hissed,” “cracked”) and selective sensory detail. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “warm and alive with possibility” verges on stock phrasing, and “burning in her mind” leans cliché. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony, but the phrase “implanted destiny” recurs with slight redundancy. These don’t obscure causality but prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—breath-like pauses during stillness rituals, urgency in panic sequences. One minor artifact: “quietly talented” appears twice with near-identical phrasing (lines 3 and 71), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Otherwise, zero scaffold, no purple prose, and metaphors remain coherent (oyster → stillness → resilience).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Strong verbs (“smudging,” “spilling,” “reconfigure”) and selective sensory detail create momentum. However, slight overwriting in peak beats (“luminescent ache” repeated thrice) edges toward motif insistence, and one paraphrase loop (“fragmented reality… scattered puzzle pieces… fragmented realities”) dulls propulsion marginally. No scaffold or syntax monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“white hair and pale skin stood in stark contrast to the deep shadows”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs (slow observation → rapid dissolution). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One slight overwriting risk: “woven into the fabric of the patterns” flirts with mixed metaphor but is grounded by immediate physicality (“dissolve at the edges”). Final line’s “scent of approaching rain” could feel ornamental, but it ties back to the encampment’s living atmosphere, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“dizzying quiet that had enveloped,” “revolutionary potential” twice). No paraphrase loops, but “echoing library under snow” recurs three times with diminishing returns—functional as motif but risks scaffold. Sentence variety supports momentum, and technical terms feel authentic. Final paragraph’s “quiet hum of history beginning to thaw” elegantly recharges earlier motifs without muddle, though “contraband truths” edges toward label-speak in last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Rhiannon slipped…”, “Her father had been…”, “Today she worked…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in “fierce desire to weave continuity through chaos”—slightly abstract for peak beats—but quickly grounded by tactile follow-up. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the “tranquil blaze” conceit remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery but avoids overwriting—each metaphor serves function (e.g., “feral lullaby” encapsulates method and tone). Sentence openings vary (“The cool-headed fisher…”, “In his weathered hand…”, “This was the timeframe…”), and paragraph cuts advance pressure. Minor redundancy in describing the rail spike’s transformation (“softer, more alive” then “hummed with captured echo”) slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or scaffold; figurative coherence remains intact even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“traced,” “scratched,” “unraveling”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears: “devotedly observant eyes” and “orbits of regret” verge on label-speak, and “solemn playfulness” is abstract. No fatal loops, but slight redundancy in describing the pen nib’s symbolism. Final paragraph’s clarity and propulsion offset these micro-slips, keeping closure sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hands as steady as the stars he inked” establishes voice immediately. Figurative language is pattern-taught (constellations → musical notes) and pays off. Minor density in mid-section (“haunted firmware that lurked… developed an uncanny attribute”) slightly bogs momentum, but closure beats are clean. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Final line crystallizes theme without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “lilac unease” conveys synesthetic emotion economically; “whispers merging with the grotto’s own voice” layers sound and setting. Minor overwriting in “deliberate and seemingly chaotic at once”—near-tautology—but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence breathes with resolution. One mixed metaphor (“exhaled an emergent hush”) slightly blurs physical logic but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled; figurative language serves accumulation (“shattered sky,” “arms of steel”) without muddle. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“fractured heavens above mirrored the fragments of civilization”), where metaphor edges toward redundancy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one template cadence (“Families picnicking… lovers embracing… merchants trading”) slightly flattens momentum. Final beat avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity—though “warm coldness” verges on oxymoronic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“translucent fingers clutched the hand-painted tarot coin”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (synesthesia) and payoff-integrated (golden threads stitching time). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“symphony of scents that painted memories and sounds that bloomed like flowers”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Repetitive phrasing (“fractally precise” x3, “static shock” x4) and synonym loops (“illuminate hidden pathways” / “retrain neural networks” / “map hidden pathways”) create scaffold drag. Elevated diction (“somatic markers,” “resonant reconfiguration”) occasionally clashes with POV lexicon. Final paragraph’s lyrical compression works, but mid-story density slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished with strong sentence variety and sensory specificity (“coastal winds swirled through her hair,” “gloves humming”). Minor overwriting in the fossil description (“factually mystical phenomenon”) leans abstract, and “emotional heat signatures that told a story” borders on explanatory. No loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “translating the unknown to the newly awakened” echoes earlier phrasing without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“measuring moments that others deemed too small to notice” conveys character, theme, and setting). Rhythm breathes with the narrative—contemplative cadence early, tighter beats during discovery. Minor overwriting in climax (“prophecies were transformed… one button at a time”) edges toward slogan, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar clarity. Final paragraph risks slight redundancy, yet propulsion remains intact, narrowly missing 9+ due to one near-purple flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally over-ornamented (“mist clinging… like a second skin,” “silver hush of the afternoon”). A paraphrase loop appears in the dual references to “fixing what’s broken” (lines 10 and 23), and “prudently daring” recurs with slight redundancy. Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “ashes have their own kind of power”) risks muddling immediacy. Still, rhythm supports emotional arc, and closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hooves silent on wet wooden planks,” “yarn needle pricked his thumb” do double duty. Minor overwriting in “percolating commitments” and “fabric of reality” risks abstraction, but figurative language remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors gutter silence—effective closure. One slight register drift (“distill complexity into essence”) borders academic but is anchored in character motive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“hands forming circles of air as if centering clay” establishes character, setting, and method). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and figurative language is coherent—light “bending,” timelines “fractured” then “resolved.” Minor deduction: slight overuse of “sharp gentleness” as a refrain borders on motif repetition without added pressure. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; closure image (“hands shaping invisible clay”) perfectly echoes opening.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“glided,” “crystallized,” “instill”) and purposeful figurative language. Sentence variety supports mood shifts—from contemplative opening to rhythmic rowing to quiet closure. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “wistfully pragmatic heart ache just a little more than usual” edges toward label-speak, and “quivering hush” repeats as motif without deepening. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize Mara’s connection to the tool rather than dramatizing it anew.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “books flowing in and out on currents of knowledge”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional figurative stacking (“golden light of acceptance”) borders on purple. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves theme or character. Minor register drift in peak beats (“atomically reflective”) slightly jars, but doesn’t obscure closure. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves the tidal motif.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “prismatic quiet” repeats four times, and adjacent sentences restate ideas (“emptier… given away pieces of her own heart”; “washed clean… revealing hidden patterns”). Figurative density peaks without payoff in the middle third, slowing momentum. Final paragraph avoids paraphrase loops, but “thread that connects all things” echoes too closely with earlier phrasing, creating slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“recalibrated,” “splintered,” “rupture”) and sensory layering. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: “cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself” and later “subtle manipulators who exploited human weaknesses” restate the same idea. The phrase “cautiously hopeful” is used twice verbatim, creating a scaffold echo. Final paragraph’s “cosmic game being played around them” slightly flattens the preceding tension with generic phrasing. Still, rhythm supports momentum, and closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “metal insect-like device,” “wistful rebellion,” “spatial mutiny” all do double duty. Sentence variety supports momentum—longer during reflection, staccato during pain. Minor overwriting in “cosmic possibility” and “impossible geometry” edges toward abstraction, but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final image of the compass clattering grounds the lyric climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative: “granite face met the morning fog,” “gold-and-silver threading still catching the dim light.” Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “furrowed hush” repetition (used thrice), slightly dulling its impact. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph compresses resolution efficiently, though “reconstruction... led to a confession” sacrifices scene for summary—a small momentum dip at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful: “spongey dread,” “blue light across panels,” “hurried burial.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing atmosphere and plot. Minor redundancy in “decoded stanzas” phrasing (lines 4 and 12), and “nervously confident” appears twice—slight paraphrase-loop. No figurative muddle; metaphors (“planet’s most unpredictable laboratory”) serve theme. Closure beat is clear, though one filter verb (“Eli watched”) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “pixelated—a dissolution of form into squares of light and shadow”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“tapestry of redemption encoded in light”) slightly blurs causality, but rhythm serves pressure. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety strong. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves motif cleanly, though one mixed metaphor (“ashes of ‘never’”) nudges clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“polished calm that belied his troubled heritage” followed by near-redundant “perceptively calm”), triggering a −0.3 density penalty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “dusky harmony” repeats with slight variation, bordering on motif reinforcement versus redundancy. Final paragraph achieves lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“tormented,” “crept,” “unlocked”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “sand through fingers,” “silent dance,” and “midnight solace” verge on stock lyricism. A paraphrase loop occurs in the final paragraph (“witnessed the connection… deciphered through a method… receive what the night sky had been signaling”) that restates the same insight. Information density is high, but the closure beat suffers slight scaffold inflation, dulling the final resonance just enough to disqualify 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “flesh-eating plant seed grew warm, responding to latent magic”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors—but occasionally leans ornate (“warlike serenity etched across her weathered face”). Minor scaffold: “Through expanding circles...” paragraph repeats “circle” structurally, creating slight template cadence. No loops or redundancies dull closure; final lines resonate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong verbs (“shimmered,” “clutched,” “pulsed”) and varied syntax. Figurative density peaks appropriately in the maze sequence without muddle. Minor scaffold: “anxious elation” repeats as label rather than evolving embodiment; “purposefully curious” feels tacked-on. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “future had arrived early” / “early arrival of what was meant to come later.” Final paragraph’s momentum slightly sags under summary, though closure image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or action. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“feathers of resolve rustled internally”)—a slight figurative excess that doesn’t obscure clarity but nudges away from 9.0+. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts mar momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and evocative, with high information density (“hollowed out like the abandoned quarry”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create rhythmic breath. Minor flaw: “resonated deeper than any crowd’s roar” borders on mixed metaphor (sound vs. depth), but it’s forgivable as character-bound lyricism. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances character, setting, or theme. Final image (“evidence bag… Leeds festival”) crystallizes closure with zero redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and dense, though occasionally over-figurative (“crackling with static energy that made the air… shimmer like a heat mirage”). Minor redundancy in describing the seed’s vibration twice. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “overwhelming desire to understand the physics of transition had consumed them” followed by similar phrasing later. Closure beat remains clear despite slight embellishment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“cold fire,” “story-silver”—and coheres within the established logic. Minor overwriting in “wintersun serenity” (slightly redundant), but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“And so the cycle continued…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“fear manifested in steel,” “hopes clinging like shadows”) without muddle. One paraphrase loop (“abandoned hopes… absorbed… acquiring abandoned hopes”) and slight overuse of “radiance” variants incur minor penalty. Final third avoids artifacts; rhythm varies effectively. Not flawless—two adjacent sentences restate the pearl’s effect—but propulsion remains strong and clarity unharmed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Minor overwriting in “bitter and sweet like the rivers she once chronicled” slightly strains metaphor coherence. Otherwise, strong verbs (“ivy clawed,” “motives danced”) and varied syntax avoid monotony. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or cipher logic. Figurative language is controlled (“mist clung like spectral garments”) and coherent. Minor overwriting appears in the phrase “cautious exuberance,” which borders on abstract label, but it’s redeemed by immediate embodiment in trembling hands and pressed letters. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, and the final line’s “unspoken gift” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“fruit left too long on the branch,” “chaotic 水下摄影”) and coheres within the story’s logic. Minor overwriting in “perforated destiny” phrasing risks abstraction, but it’s redeemed by concrete payoff (fractures become conduits). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic resolution—longer sentences taper into crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “her hands first honoring what was lost, then restoring what could be saved” establishes dual role economically). Figurative language is purposeful—aurora as amplifier, static as entropy—and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“strands of memory weaving together like threads across a loom, each colored by the woman's emotions”) edges toward paraphrase loop, but doesn’t obscure closure. Rhythm varies naturally; final paragraph’s cadence echoes opening, reinforcing Charged Poise without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“fingers finding familiar holds,” “clouds drifted below her feet as if solid”). Occasional overwriting in peak beats (“starlight illuminated pathways through the mist” borders on ornamental), and one paraphrase loop: “forgiving the unforgivable betrayal that had shattered her world” / “woman who had destroyed her life’s work.” Still, rhythm varies purposefully, and closure image avoids scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “hollow mirror shard... absorbing the weight of secrets it could never truly reflect” does character, theme, and object work. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor redundancy in “method of deciphering wind chime selections had been passed down... each adding their own understanding” slightly bloats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (cloak of doubt, winds of change). Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with explanatory wrap-up, but closure image redeems.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “sycamore hush” fuses sound and silence; “stone stopped mid-fall—its ripples never reach their full potential” avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “chronological paradox mirroring the lesson”—slightly academic for the lyrical tone. Sentence variety propels momentum, though “The floating rock platform trembled slightly...” repeats “platform” unnecessarily after prior mentions.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“ripples across an infinite pond,” “living constellations”), risking density in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, but some near-redundancy (“pulse left wandering” repeated without added pressure). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Final lines avoid scaffold, landing cleanly on the pulsing arrowhead. A few mixed metaphors (“sky-writings,” “harmonic key”) slightly blur clarity, but propulsion remains strong. Artifact penalties prevent 9+ eligibility despite high craft.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ice glistened with a brilliant dimness” conveys setting, mood, and theme). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “prescribed patterns of color” and “paradoxically bright yet lacking true radiance”—slight redundancy—but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and payoff-driven; closure beat remains lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “oil lamp casting dancing shadows” establishes mood, character, and setting in one phrase. Sentence variety supports rhythm, especially in the climactic symphony. One flaw: “luminous vow of pure silver light” risks mixed metaphor (vow as object), slightly muddying the transformation beat. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“tumbled,” “fracture,” “distill”) and varied syntax. However, recurring phrases like “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” verge on label-looping, and “backwards prophecy” is repeated without deepening. The line “I must distill the truth from these signals” borders on expository interiority. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting in cosmic descriptions (“symphony of human experience”) dilutes immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “tears of centuries” conveys backstory and emotion). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and metaphors cohere (“shadows made solid,” “voice like dry leaves”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “crystallized through scattered light” repeats slightly, and “formless dread into something manageable” edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy (“scattered light… crystallize” appears three times) warrants a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “fractured bronze ship’s bell that lay at his feet like a fallen giant” does setting, character, and stakes in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (water → intention → spectral bell) and pays off without muddle. Minor scaffold in “brittle devotion… faith that had somehow persisted” slightly flattens momentum, but no loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Final paragraph’s cadence varies effectively, avoiding syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sapphire-hued liqueur label,” “wind chime... fell silent,” “spinning silence into meaning” all do thematic and atmospheric work. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “muted shades of violet and indigo”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Closure line (“reclaimed truth”) risks abstraction but is anchored by preceding concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: phrases like “ancient freshness” and “touch of wonder” verge on abstraction. Minor redundancy appears in repeated references to “final transformation” and “harmonization.” Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “halo around her face,” “essence of ancient freshness”) slightly dulls immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative but occasionally over-ornamented: “soundless echo” recurs as near-paraphrase, and “attentively inventive”/“remembering through muscle memory” appear as templated refrains. Sentence openings vary well, yet some high-pressure beats stack figurative language (“infinite puzzle scattered across eternity”) without advancing causality. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold loops slightly dull propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “shed her former identity like a snake shedding skin” avoids cliché through specificity of action. Sentences vary in length and structure; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “kaleidoscope of genuine emotion” risks abstraction, but it’s anchored by contrast to Maya’s “fortress against feeling.” No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every line advances character, theme, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought: “storm-born silence,” “hush of possibility,” and “nocturnal sanctuary” verge on repetitive lyricism. Two adjacent sentences restate the seed’s mystery without added pressure (paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph tightens rhythm effectively, though “silent storm of creativity” risks cliché. Information density is strong—most lines serve atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but clear, with high information yield per line (e.g., “mournfully eager requiem” conveys motive, tone, and method). Minor redundancy in “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” appears three times, slightly dulling climax impact. Otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully—staccato for action, legato for memory—and metaphors cohere (sound as liquid, silence as crust). No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks mar momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ocean of liquid starlight,” “cities of glass under violet suns”) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the narrative’s ebb and flow. One minor flaw: the phrase “foggy lucidity” appears twice, slightly diluting its impact, but not enough to obscure closure. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—though a few modifiers edge toward overwriting (“corrupted crystal humming with power that ebbed and flowed like the tide…”).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“frozen bloom,” “embers like trapped fireflies”) and consistent. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weathered from countless failed experiments… shattered traditions”) edges toward redundancy. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“evolution,” “possibility”), dulling closure’s tactile impact.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes propulsion: “serenely electric piece of cosmic debris that hummed with latent energy” stacks modifiers without advancing action. No paraphrase loops, but “discarding assumptions” appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Sentence variety is strong, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and closure line resonates. One minor artifact: “quiet the mind, quiet the surroundings” uses template cadence, slightly dulling the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“water shimmered like liquid starlight,” “sands resembling neural pathways”) and varied syntax. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor artifacts include slight synonym churn (“translucent,” “ethereal,” “spectral” in close proximity) and one paraphrase loop (“fractured realities” / “fractured selves”). No scaffold sentences or momentum-dragging description; even exposition (“trained since childhood”) is anchored in present action. Closure beat remains unmarred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“sinew thread pulsing with memories,” “walls seemed to breathe with unsettling calm”) and high information density. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional escalation. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“cascades of color and sound, weaving new patterns in an endless dance”), where figurative language slightly dilutes propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative (“bioluminescent algae drift past like terrestrial stars”), with strong verbs and specific nouns. Occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “somber marvel of their altered reality” borders on abstract label. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences, though one near-redundancy exists (“unfolded horizons... opening new possibilities”). Final paragraph’s lyricism enhances closure without muddle. Information density is high—most lines advance theme, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “mist-clad atrium,” “pulse flickering like an irregular heartbeat” do double duty in atmosphere and tension. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “decades-old concern had transformed it”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded. No loops or scaffold; every line advances plot, character, or mood. Closure image (“framed her grandmother's last photograph anew”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “fibrous veins pulsing with humanity’s digital lifeblood” merges setting, metaphor, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught (gold flecks, crashing hush) and pays off. Deducted for slight overwriting in “psychic energy could travel through undersea cables during specific tidal conditions”—expository but necessary. No loops or scaffold; closure line (“sacred silence between”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “opal observatory pulses with energy under the snow globe of night” merges setting and emotion. Minimal scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. One slight redundancy (“defragment my fragmented memories”) slightly dulls a key beat. Otherwise, figurative language is precise (“ephemeral patterns in spilled ink”), rhythm varied, and closure image (“fresh coffee already made”) resonant without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or method. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“wrinkled skin, copper veins more prominent”) borders on scaffold but doesn’t loop. No figurative muddle—metaphors (canvas of craft, dying language) are consistent and physical. Closure beat is artifact-free and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gravitationally playful way the garden's resident gremlins danced upside down” conveys physics, behavior, and tone). Figurative language is coherent (“frostbitten hope” recurs with evolving resonance), and sentence openings vary. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph (“cosmic joke nature had played”) slightly softens the closure beat but doesn’t obscure it.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“gnarled,” “pulsed,” “entwined”) and varied sentence structures. Information density is high—each line advances setting, character, or theme. A slight paraphrase loop appears in descriptions of the statues (“rigid,” “petrified gazes”), and “resonantly soft” borders on label-like repetition. No scaffold or momentum loss; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and dense—“brittle hush,” “weathered face,” “scarred plastic table”—with strong verbs and concrete nouns. Figurative language is purposeful (storm = swallowed words), not overdone. One paraphrase loop: “linking absences” appears twice with near-identical phrasing, slightly dulling momentum. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, ending on resonant image. No register drift or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “misting hush” does atmospheric, thematic, and causal work. Sentence rhythms vary effectively, especially during the song crescendo. Minor overwriting in “creatures of light dancing to a melody that spoke of joy and sorrow…” slightly softens immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“creating magic from the misting hush”) recharges the opening motif with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“tattered fibers conducting analog memories like synapses”) and avoids purple excess. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths modulate rhythm effectively. However, mild overwriting appears in the middle third: “observed solitude was her natural state… invisible work she performed” paraphrases earlier ideas. The phrase “sanely eccentric” repeats verbatim, creating a small loop. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “books seemed to murmur secrets,” “luminous absence,” “vitalize the images” all do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “alchemical” and “improbable beginnings” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm crystallizes stakes without redundancy. One near-paraphrase (“capture... preserve” vs. “presence to acknowledge”) costs 0.3—but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “twilight painted the sky in shades of indigo and lavender” establishes tone, time, and mood in one stroke. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts align with beat shifts. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Deduction for mild overwriting: “enveloped secrets,” “cosmic possibility,” and “unassumingly bold” verge on ornamental abstraction, though redeemed by context. Closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “wooden hulls collapsed like skeletons surrendering” merges simile with thematic surrender. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “constellations above began to realign, mending themselves as her consciousness knit back together”—“knit” slightly mixed with celestial mechanics. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“fairy ring that refused to let her forget”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sunlight struggled through the arched windows” conveys both atmosphere and thematic weight. Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer clauses for ritual, staccato for tension. Minor overwriting in “fractured truths” and “combative tenderness” edges toward label-speak, but is redeemed by immediate embodiment. No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line’s “shadows lengthen” ties back with earned resonance, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “blue-white light emerged from her fingers, wrapping around the seed like a cocoon” risks purple prose. Figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats, without pattern-teaching payoff—metaphors accumulate but don’t cohere into a taught system. No paraphrase loops, but slight synonym churn (“radiant hush,” “verdant parapet,” “hush of budding hope”) creates minor redundancy. Final lines land cleanly, though artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “silence accumulated like dust,” “net coiled like the shed skin of some ancient sea beast”—metaphors are consistent and purposeful. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., “interlaced hush” repeated) is pattern-taught and pays off, not overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“methodically comparing silent video footage,” “celestial events that hadn't been recorded”). Sentence openings vary (“Her current project,” “The vault's ceiling,” “One rainy Tuesday”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “profound sense of shielded openness”—slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by action (“carefully repaired the torn map”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (rain “scours” frescoes, aligning with thematic erosion/recovery).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding template cadence. Figurative language (“water droplets rolling… like tears”) is purposeful and consistent. Minor overwriting in “sophisticated, almost beautiful in its clarity”—slightly abstract for peak beat—but quickly grounded by action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s propulsion crystallizes theme without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary (“In the ethereal realm…”, “This was the domain…”, “Elara existed…”), avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“tinkersong wonder that echoed through the digital ether”), slightly muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of stacked modifiers (“brilliant flash and the rumbling response”) edges toward purple prose without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “crystalline walls fracturing the light into scattered patterns” does triple duty (setting, motif, foreshadowing). Minimal loops; each floor advances knowledge or emotion. One slight redundancy: “encrypted diary” appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Final paragraph’s “scattered light and determined compassion” risks abstraction but is rescued by prior concrete grounding. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “swayed,” “memorialize”) and varied sentence structure. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “a prisoner of perspective” followed by “suspended between earth and sky” repeats spatial liminality without added pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; “dusty starlight” motif sustains without muddle. Final paragraph’s “memorializing the very concept of connection itself” edges toward abstraction, slightly dulling the otherwise concrete closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information yield per line—e.g., “posture, gestures, the way light caught hair” conveys method, limitation, and artistry in one breath. Minor overwriting appears in “fractally precise mapping system,” slightly academic for an artist’s internal voice, but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm effectively. No loops or scaffold—every image serves escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and generally propulsive, though occasional redundancy dulls momentum (“meticulously curious nature prevented him from giving up, even when the connection remained elusive”). Figurative language is controlled—“stranded luminance,” “starling murmurations”—but “sociable isolation” borders on diagnostic label-speak. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Minor scaffold in mid-section slows beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, each sentence advancing atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (driftwood = impermanence; mirrors = lineage), though “hauntingly bright” appears thrice with diminishing returns. No paraphrase loops, but “through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner” repeats verbatim—a scaffold artifact that mildly dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s rainbow reflections powerfully echo earlier motifs, earning high information density. Deduction for one repetitive phrase and slight over-reliance on visual metaphor in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though occasional overwriting appears (“elegant script,” “nebula of respite shimmered”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density intensifies in climactic beats without pattern-teaching (e.g., “brambled hope” introduced late). Final paragraph’s cadence (“forever interconnected, forever thriving”) borders on incantatory but earns its lyricism through accumulated motif. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing, though not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“threads of fractured starlight,” “frozen moonlight”—but avoids overwriting; each metaphor serves atmosphere or tactic. Sentence variety supports momentum, though one minor redundancy appears (“bruised purple and bruised orange”). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes opening, creating closure without loop. High information density: “pane of hush” does triple duty (setting, concept, acoustic condition).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “pulsing gently in his palm as if alive” conveys both sensation and mystery; “night frost would form with deadly precision” merges environment and threat. Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “reluctant caretaker” appears twice in similar constructions. Figurative language is restrained but potent—no muddle in peak beats. Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong sentence variation and purposeful figurative language (“river’s song seemed to harmonize,” “grief had loosened its grip”). However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “symphonically minded scientist had fled” uses elevated diction that borders on label-speak, and “molecular connections” / “human ones” risks therapy-adjacent abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize insight rather than dramatize the cognitive shift (“She had been seeing separation… should have recognized connection”).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glass trees grew between bookshelves, their transparent branches heavy with crystalline fruits that pulsed with captured narratives” advances setting, theme, and character in one breath. Figurative language is coherent—moonlight as quantified absence, shards as narrative tools—without mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“fragments of discarded memories, each carefully positioned to catch the moonlight at specific angles”) slightly stalls momentum, but closure beats (“watching them form a door where before there had been only empty air”) are crisp. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line: “brittle walls glistening,” “remorse crystallized like ice,” “sandpaper rough memories.” Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts advance momentum. However, light overwriting appears in peak beats—three consecutive sentences use “brittle” or “sturdy” with slight redundancy—and one paraphrase loop (“subsumed by stored remorse… experiencing their regrets as if his own”) dulls immediacy. No scaffold or template cadence; closure image remains sharp despite minor figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-figured: “hearts empty,” “tapestry of understanding,” “vigorous tender spirit” flirt with abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“disconnected timepiece and her disconnected community”). Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high. However, the phrase “borrowed starlight” appears twice verbatim—a small scaffold artifact. Closure image is clear, but elevated diction in peak moments slightly distances embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“moonlight painted circuit boards in ethereal blues”), but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “quaking reverie” repeats without evolution, and metaphors like “underground rivers of human aspiration” verge on abstraction. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, two adjacent lines restate the mirror’s purpose (“not as a damaged object but as the key…” / “restored not to perfection but to purpose”), triggering a paraphrase-loop deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-embellished: “clandestinely luminous” repeats four times, creating a paraphrase loop. Sentences like “The forgotten combinations she sought held the key to the seeds of vigilance planted by predecessors who had foreseen the coming darkness” suffer from stacked modifiers and passive abstraction. Momentum stalls in mid-story exposition about threshold effects already shown. Final paragraph recovers with concrete sensory closure (“taste of mist,” “weight of responsibility”), but earlier density hampers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “stress cracks that spiderwebbed” conveys age, damage, and musical notation simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent (fog as “whispered secrets,” tears as “prisms of sound”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “empathy in motion” phrasing, but no artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, though minor overwriting appears: “thoughtfully precise” repeats verbatim three times, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls immediacy. Otherwise, syntax varies naturally, sentences advance multiple aims (e.g., “The dent in the stone caught the last light…” conveys image, symbol, and closure). No mixed metaphors or scaffold; information density is high. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, trusting image over explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or method. Sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “Her fingers…”, “Tonight…”, “With theatrical sincerity…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shimmer between sorrow and acceptance”) edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by immediate action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity remains intact through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, advancing character and atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “pulsed with blue light” followed by “living library disguised by its morbid name” stacks abstraction. A paraphrase loop occurs in the final paragraph (“listen not just with my ears, but with my entire being” echoes earlier “undercurrent of wisdom”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 8.8+ line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“rivers tore free,” “roots waving freely”) and selective sensory detail. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “whirling silence that simultaneously filled Arion with both dread and wonder” risks abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “deafening void” / “whirling silence” borders on repetitive motif without escalation. Final paragraph lands cleanly with earned stasis and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally lean and evocative, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, recurring phrases like “rapidly adapting” and “hazy precision” verge on label-speak, and the patch’s reappearance feels slightly ornamental. Minor redundancy in describing wind patterns (“chaotic energy,” “unusual damage”) dilutes momentum. No fatal artifacts, but a few scaffold lines (“Her motivation went beyond solving…”) tell rather than dramatize, preventing 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density: “sculpted hush” does conceptual, atmospheric, and plot work. Sentence openings vary (“As one who...”, “Today, she carried...”, “Raising her hands...”), and rhythm breathes with the performance. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“tapestry of sound and color that danced together”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “avalanchingly quiet” recurs meaningfully, sentence lengths vary to mirror ritual pacing. Few artifacts—only “weathered leather case”/“weathered wood” verges on synonym churn. Figurative language is coherent (sound “grows exponentially,” air “pearlescence”). Deduction for one paraphrase loop: “solitude and profound reflection” → later “meditative” process restates intent without added pressure. Otherwise, high information density with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rhythmic clanking of the press,” “refracted moonlight into geometric patterns” do double duty. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shadows deepening where they should have lightened, angles defying logical measurement”) risks slight muddle but remains legible. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Final paragraph’s cadence shift to daylight routine creates earned stasis without redundancy. One paraphrase risk (“borrowing his personality like a library book” / “borrowed personalities not for pleasure”) but not adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“navigated,” “coax,” “germinate”) and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful—pendant “pulsing,” auroras “painting”—without purple excess. One paraphrase loop: “extend brief encounters into unforgettable moments” / “extend brief encounters into eternal stories.” Final paragraph’s “vibrating moment at a time” edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by concrete imagery (“earth itself remembered”). High information density; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic but occasionally overwrites: “shifted hush,” “truthful lies,” and “accumulated feelings trapped within the prism” lean into abstraction. Minor redundancy appears in repeated phrases like “quartz arbor in mist” and “timeframe when assumptions shatter.” Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, peak beats suffer slight register drift—elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing” implied) clashes with grounded mystic POV.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stoically sparkling,” “latent possibility”) and high information-per-line. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the narrative’s hush. Minor overwriting appears in “time's unraveling tapestry” (slightly redundant with “raveling silence”), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Closure beat is clean: touch → hum → return of sound. One mixed metaphor (“threads of undetectable sound”) slightly blurs physical logic but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely precise and propulsive, with strong verbs (“hammering,” “coax,” “conjure”) and purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting appears in the mine-shaft description (“shadows that seemed to dance in mocking recognition”), slightly diluting immediacy. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary naturally. The final paragraph’s lyricism (“echo of his determination… whisper of blue silk against steel”) earns its resonance through prior accumulation, though “broken dreams” edges toward abstraction—a rare slip in an otherwise concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong sentence-level propulsion and varied openings. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“shimmering possibilities that existed just beyond normal perception”), leaning into abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“forbidden texts behind the Archives' sealed doors”) edges toward generic fantasy diction. Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative softening.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and precise (“white tower piercing the morning fog like a solitary promise,” “stone stack balanced with impossible precision”). Figurative language is sparse in high-pressure beats, avoiding purple overload. Minor redundancy in “luminescent ache” appearing twice slightly dulls its impact, and “weathered by sea and time” edges toward cliché. Otherwise, high information density, varied sentence openings, and strong verbs (“piercing,” “enveloped,” “imbued”) sustain momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “laughter bubble up unexpectedly” conveys emotion and anomaly). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “shadowed elation” appears three times with diminishing returns. Figurative coherence holds—aurora, emerald, nebulas form consistent palette—but “unpredictable室白鲟” is a garbled artifact that breaks legibility, likely a generation error.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density—e.g., “quietly explosive” modifies both impact and understanding economically. Figurative language is coherent (light “caresses,” mist “embraces”) and tied to core motifs. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “sun trails of human connection,” which leans toward abstraction, but momentum holds. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; final line recharges the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information yield per line (e.g., “moonlight slicing through the high windows” conveys light, weather, architecture). Figurative language is purposeful (“swirling like liquid mercury”) and coherent. Minor redundancy in “deconstructing stubborn wall sections to reroute steam pipes” slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly balances revelation and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and stakes simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the keeper’s actions. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“brilliant tapestry of dawn”) slightly blurs specificity, and “bound release” borders on abstract label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “restore the balance… sundered in the great unraveling” / “rekindling of the dying realm.” Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—each line advances character or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“nestled paradoxes that defined Eleanor's existence”), leaning into figurative repetition without payoff. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines restate the paradox concept (“hidden in plain sight... known to few yet accessible”), triggering a slight paraphrase penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously (“wild sages and mint pushing through cracked flagstones” conveys resilience, decay, and Eliza’s attention). Rhythm varies effectively—longer descriptive lines give way to terse beats at climax. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “meaningful truths often hid in plain sight, changing so gradually…” restates the opening premise without new pressure. Figurative language is controlled, though “tenuous absolution” edges toward label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and generally propulsive, but suffers minor overwriting: “gently meticulous” appears three times, and “conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion” is repeated verbatim twice, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent—starlight, crystallized time, luminous vows form a consistent motif system. However, the phrase “quartz hush” borders on mixed metaphor (sound described as mineral), slightly muddying sensory logic. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “the silence that screams,” “trust shattered like dropped glass,” and “time slipping through her fingers like damp sea air” avoid cliché through precise metaphor. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating toward the climax. Minor redundancy in “false starts and calculated misdirection” followed by listing the lies slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar the closure beat. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot—but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats (e.g., “futuristic nostalgia” appears twice, slightly redundant). Figurative language is mostly coherent (aurora as voting algorithms, forests holding elections), though “democratic processes of the forest” borders on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm accelerates toward convergence. Minor scaffold in “terrestrially cosmic” repetition, but no loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with image and metaphor, often doing triple duty—advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. However, figurative language occasionally overloads: “auroral sorrow,” “luminous regret,” “art’s version of a broken combination lock” risk mixed-register strain. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive phrasing (“after silence, after sorrow, after rediscovery”). Final paragraph avoids purple excess, grounding epiphany in physical gesture—charcoal fingers on canvas—preserving momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“fingers leaving trails of liquid gold that cured permanently when she spoke her deepest truths aloud”). Figurative language is controlled and coherent (truth as botanical life raft, conversations as evaporated tears). Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“desperate botanical life raft” borders on mixed metaphor), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final image (“keys to a kingdom not of wealth, but of restored truth”) lands with clean propulsion and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “crystal clear and seemingly infinite in its overtones” conveys sound, rarity, and emotional impact in one phrase. Sentence openings vary (“During winter months...” / “One spring morning...” / “As she held it...”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching thematic cadence. Minor overwriting in “feverish diligence” (slightly generic modifier), but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line (“silent music of light”) masterfully recharges motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “magnetic north began its irreversible shift” opens with stakes and voice. Sentences vary rhythmically, avoiding monotony. One paraphrase loop: “fragmentation spread… each cluster… separating yet maintaining connection” slightly redundant. Figurative language (“bio-luminescent petals dimming”) stays coherent. Closure image (“roots connecting… to the garden soil”) lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“polished,” “intruded,” “reconfigured”) and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple layers: “The aged locket was Leo's key—not literally, but symbolically” efficiently merges object and theme. Minor overwriting in “sandstorm calm persisted among the residents”—slightly abstract—but quickly grounded in action. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat (“listening truly had healed something in all of them”) avoids sentimentality through concrete antecedent (reading letters).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“traced,” “pulsed,” “woven”) and selective sensory detail. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “purposeful grace,” “calm defiance,” and “mysterious familiarity” verge on label-speak. The phrase “as a spider spins its web” repeats verbatim three times—a scaffold loop that dulls momentum. Otherwise, line-level craft supports propulsion and theme effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “geometric crystals climbed the walls like frozen light” does triple duty (image, setting, metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor flaw: “gleaming silence” repeats four times—effective as motif but borders on overuse. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“relit the lanterns… continuing her work…”) closes with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in key moments: phrases like “terrestrially cosmic forces mingled freely” and “smoothed hush” verge on self-contradictory abstraction. Repetition of “quiet brook,” “nocturnal haven,” and “whispered secrets” creates paraphrase loops that dilute momentum. While rhythm varies admirably, high-pressure beats suffer from figurative density without payoff—e.g., “tranquil blaze” is evocative but never grounded in physical sensation. These artifacts dull the closure’s impact, preventing higher-band entry despite strong imagery elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is precise and evocative: “ephemeral as forgotten words,” “grace that belied his eighty-some years.” Sentences vary in structure and length, advancing atmosphere and plot without padding. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves the accumulative design. Figurative language is coherent (meteors = forgotten words; seal = key), and the final line resonates without overstatement. Minor deduction: “patiently nimble” edges toward label, but is immediately grounded in action (“measuring sugar with hands that trembled only slightly”).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially in climax (“The velvet garden seemed to hold its breath…”). However, adjacent paraphrase-loop in “isolation had indeed transformed into independence, achieved through the ghostly resolve…” weakens propulsion. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Closure beat remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“traced,” “dissolved,” “pricked”) and selective sensory detail. Minor overwriting in “ethereal blues to soft purples” slightly dilutes momentum, and “calibrated treason” appears twice with near-identical phrasing—a faint loop. Yet information density is high: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Final paragraph avoids redundancy, closing with resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“whispering seashell half murmured fragments of ancient conversations, webs of intrigue spun across generations”). However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “reed-blown melancholy” recurs as label more than embodied sensation, and “webs of intrigue” verges on mixed metaphor (sonic echoes vs. visual webs). No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally borders on purple in the middle third. Final paragraph achieves clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive—“coral-encrusted beams,” “frozen tears” do double duty. Figurative language is restrained in high-pressure beats (ocean search uses concrete verbs: “cutting,” “nestled”). Minor scaffold: “piecing together a pattern the spirits were trying to expose” slightly paraphrases prior “fragments.” Final paragraph’s “woven truth carefully until it became something beautiful” edges toward abstraction but is anchored by the glowing snow globe. No loops or syntactic monotony; read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “hexagonal openings that mirrored honeycomb efficiency” conveys form, function, and theme in one image. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Minor overwriting in “demure audacity” and “scintillatingly somber”—elevated diction slightly jars—but these don’t obscure causality or dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“fruit impossibly perfect amid radioactive dust storms”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs shift visually. One paraphrase loop: “sharply observant eyes” appears twice verbatim—a scaffold slip that mildly dulls immediacy. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing on concrete hope. Artifact penalty applied for repetitive phrasing, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“cobweb patterns,” “static” as truth-carrier) without muddle. Minor redundancy in describing the portico’s function twice slightly dulls momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Final paragraph propels cleanly, with “smiled at the fragmented radio frequencies” echoing earlier motifs without restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “positively wistful,” “gleaned redemption,” and “theater of his solitary existence” do thematic and atmospheric work. Minor overwriting in the opening (“shifting sands above created a natural ceiling that filtered light in mysterious patterns”) edges toward purple, but most figurative language is controlled. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final line crystallizes the arc without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“raced,” “billowed,” “pulsed”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (“ice cracked like distant bones,” “darkness embracing him like an old friend”). Minor overwriting in “fleshly ethereal” and “numinous yet deeply physical” risks abstraction, and “logically emotional” verges on label-speak. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“polished obsidian mirror,” “softly purposeful” repeated). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the end restate the revolution’s nature with slight synonym churn (“true change rarely comes… quiet persistence”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line lands with earned simplicity, avoiding purple prose at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with varied sentence lengths and strong verbs (“clutched,” “reverberate,” “pry”). Minor overwriting appears in “entangled memories she’d kept carefully compartmentalized”—slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “watchfully calm” repeats as label rather than action. Final paragraph avoids purple prose; closure image (“lantern’s light... illuminate her path”) lands with clarity. One template cadence (“She documented... photographed... noticed”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “dust particles visible in the late afternoon light” conveys both setting and emotional weight. Sentence variety supports rhythm—short clauses during tension, lyrical flow in reflection. One paraphrase loop: “broken things” repeated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Figurative language is coherent (heart as mechanism, light as revelation), though “spirit trapped between worlds” borders on generic. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“coasted,” “transliterate,” “recalibrated”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“irreverent awe filled the glider’s processors”)—register drift toward human-centric idiom. No paraphrase loops, but “steadily curious” repeats as a label rather than evolving embodiment. Final lines avoid scaffold, though “gloriously unique—a pioneering cart indeed” edges toward declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, plot, or character. Strong verbs (“skipped her breath,” “burning a hole in her memory”) and selective sensory detail create momentum. Minor artifact: slight overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (“screaming out to be found,” “malevolent eyes”) edges toward purple prose without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Final line resonates without summary, closing the motif loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “purple and deep, like the twilight hour when shadows rule but light has not fully surrendered” risks purple prose in a high-pressure beat. Minor paraphrase loops (“weighted breath before reply” / “weighted breath had been exhaled”) and repetitive stems (“each reflection… each glimpse…”) create slight drag. Otherwise, strong verbs (“clutched,” “groaned,” “shuddered”) and varied syntax sustain momentum. Closure image remains clear despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ice cracked and moaned like living things” conveys sound, movement, and metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“delicate but strong, beautiful but functional”), risking paraphrase-loop. Figurative language is consistent—ice, wind, light recur with evolving valence—but “windborne solace” edges toward abstraction. No scaffold or register drift; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose suffers from significant paraphrase loops: the phrase “after the final bus departed the vacant station” repeats verbatim three times, creating scaffold fatigue. Adjacent sentences frequently restate ideas (“destined mismatches… incompatible like wine and spoiled fruit” / “destined mismatches were not failures but opportunities”). Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, template cadence (“He… He… He…”) and filter-verb reliance (“he began to see,” “he realized,” “he remembered”) dull immediacy. These artifacts obscure momentum without breaking clarity, but prevent high-band scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “conjuring clearings between realities” and “ley lines converging” verge on abstraction without grounding. Minor scaffold in repeated “through peripheral awareness” phrasing. Yet rhythm varies skillfully, sentences multitask (e.g., “sand… held memories” conveys setting, theme, and backstory), and closure image (“truth could grow wild”) is crystalline. One paraphrase loop (“preserved understanding transcending words” / “echo of wisdom”) slightly dulls peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density (“metal bones slowly being reclaimed by nature”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “masterpiece of shared understanding” edges into abstraction, and “pulse with energy” verges on stock phrasing. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize healing’s effect rather than dramatize it (“something magical began to happen... air thickened”). Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative softness.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “weathered innocence clung to him like the scent of old paper”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: three adjacent sentences use “fractured sequences” with near-identical phrasing, creating a paraphrase loop. Also, “sonically reflective properties” is slightly technical for the lyrical register—a minor register drift. These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ships in a misty harbor,” “a thousand sighs layered together,” “tidal longing”—each image advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the fog’s rhythm. One minor artifact: “fleeting” and “echoes” slightly overlap in adjacent lines, but not enough to dull propulsion. Final line (“arranging driftwood as directional markers for his journey home”) perfectly echoes the opening method, closing the loop with earned poise—no overwriting, no redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful; figurative language (“silence thick enough to touch,” “clouds like waves in an ocean of darkness”) serves atmosphere and theme. However, slight overwriting in peak beats (“luminous ache of recognition deep within her”) edges toward label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax paraphrase the clock’s meaning (“map, not a malfunction” / “subtle signs...restructured understanding”), costing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density (“breathing becomes the only metronome”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and metaphors cohere (music as bridge, scent as hope). Minor overwriting in “radiant haven above the clouds” borders on abstraction, but the phrase pays off thematically. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Closure image is sharp, with zero muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor scaffold in “closing loops of energy… piece together fractured knowledge” slightly paraphrases. Figurative language is controlled, though “spoons bent reality” risks whimsy without payoff. No syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Closure beat is clean but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “iridescent luminescence,” “perpetual twilight,” “flesh and shadow” do double duty. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One minor artifact: “defying all rational explanation” slightly drifts toward summary, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (tooth dissolves into light completing “exchange”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-figured (“earthbound star watcher,” “zephyr bloom,” “pearl of stillness” cluster near closure). No paraphrase loops, but “reflectively vibrant” appears twice with minimal variation. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. High information density—most lines advance theme, character, or setting. However, “fireless and pure” risks label-speak; slight purple hue in final paragraph dulls closure’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line payoff. Sentence variety supports cadence; paragraph cuts feel intentional. Minor overwriting in “protected vulnerability” and “quietly proactive” edges toward label-speak, but not in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (moss, spiral, amber). Final paragraph avoids purple prose while delivering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“lucidly watchful” x3, “swirling hush” x2, “against the current” x2) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “bittersweet conclusion” / “closing pages” / “final paragraph”). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled (“feral nexus,” “mathematical geometry” juxtaposed with “fiction as true calling”). Sentence openings vary adequately, yet template cadence appears in middle paragraphs (“Through ephemeral cameo…”, “His profound motivation…”). Final third contains register drift (“solemnize,” “resonating with each carefully chosen word”) that borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “luminescence, pulsing as if it held a heartbeat” merges image and implication. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent descriptive clauses (“half-finished inventions and scattered notes, each bearing the mark…”), slightly slowing momentum—but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines (“When everything aligns again…”) resonate without redundancy, closing the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but occasional overwriting appears: “skeletal fingers,” “dance between what is and what could be,” and “pregnant with possibility” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“movement – the slow, deliberate gestures… the gradual formation… the anticipation”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports escalation. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but figurative density slightly dulls peak-beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“marble walls growing warmer as she worked”). Figurative language is consistent (light as language, echoes as harvest) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “wounded season” phrasing (used 4x), but never adjacent. Final paragraph’s cadence accelerates then settles, mirroring the timer’s awakening—no scaffold, no loops, high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “calcified into stone” concretizes metaphor; “shingled hush” merges sound and structure. Sentence variety supports momentum—e.g., short imperative “‘Burden,’ whispered…” amid flowing description. Minimal artifacts: “whalebone reverie” appears twice but evolves from state to insight. One near-loop: “orienting properly” repeats, but the second instance shows adjusted positioning under brighter starlight, adding tactical pressure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Boundary-lessly trapped… boundary-lessly connected”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting in “crystallized time” metaphor slightly risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by concrete anchors (kettle, rain, wood). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One near-redundancy: “hauntingly practical” appears twice, but second use reframes it as legacy, justifying recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“waters still now after the celestial carousel had ground to an abrupt halt”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language remains coherent (e.g., ambitions “settled like silt”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“translucent images formed in the air before him in mesmerizing patterns”), slightly blurring immediacy. No scaffold artifacts or register drift compromise clarity, though the final paragraph’s “liquid peace” edges toward abstraction without grounding in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“brushed away,” “threw the main switch”) and varied sentence openings. A few near-redundancies (“maze of intentions” repeated without deepening) and one overwrought metaphor (“sleeping giants” for transformers) slightly dull momentum. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; closure beat remains clear. Information density is high—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high information density: "excruiciatingly gentle fingers" conveys physical precision and emotional fragility simultaneously. Minor overwriting in "multifaceted surfaces catching earliest light like distant stars" slightly dilutes crystal uniqueness. No paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve rhythm (e.g., bear’s entrance as single-sentence paragraph). Final line’s "gears turn in mind" risks cliché but redeems through mechanical specificity earlier established.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely polished with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “serene upheaval—a calm certainty about the deception, yet turbulent in its implications” edges toward label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences restate the sundial’s metaphorical function (“more than a timekeeping device… a metaphor…”), slightly dulling propulsion. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully, and the final paragraph resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “snow began to dust the weathered planks” conveys setting, mood, and fragility in one stroke. Figurative language is controlled—fulgurite as “lightning captured in sand” resonates without overreach. Minor redundancy appears in “infinitely patient and infinitely grateful” (final paragraph), a slight register drift toward abstraction. Otherwise, every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme; rhythm breathes with the scene’s ebb and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“autumn leaves danced around him like spirits preparing for winter” establishes setting, mood, and foreshadowing). Figurative language is coherent—thread metaphors sustain throughout without contradiction. Minor overwriting in “projection of presence had become a defense…” slightly drifts toward abstraction, but remains grounded in embodied cost. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary; final paragraph’s cadence accelerates appropriately. Closure image (“gleamed in the starlight”) avoids purple prose while resonating.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“swayed,” “pulsed,” “dismantling”) and varied syntax that breathes during reflection and accelerates during assembly. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: “The egg pulsed gently, as if aware…” followed by “The egg’s light began to fade…” creates mild redundancy. Figurative language is dense but coherent—no mixed metaphors—and the final line (“dreaming of flight”) recharges the opening motif effectively. A slight overwriting tendency appears in mid-section (“bitter sweetness filled Elorian’s heart…”), but clarity and propulsion remain intact, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“obsidian lagoon shimmered, its waters dark as the past”), but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats: “gracefully alert” appears three times, verging on scaffold. Sentence openings vary well, yet two adjacent lines restate “transformation requires both fire and water, destruction and grafting” → paraphrase loop. Final paragraph’s momentum sags slightly with summary (“her journey had taught her…”).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“hair catching dim light like a luminous skeptic”—but occasionally overwrites: “stone throats,” “defiant hush,” and “sidereal patience” risk abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, slightly blurring clarity at the climax. Final lines land cleanly, though: “water danced... reflecting stars” ties motif to closure with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“approximating infinity with each rotation” repeats near-identically three times). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“across the quiet sigh of falling petals” appears verbatim four times), dulling momentum slightly. Figurative language is coherent within its own logic, though density in high-pressure beats borders on ornamental. Final paragraph avoids artifacts; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust motes dancing above his workbench like unsettled spirits” does atmosphere, character, and motif in one. Figurative language is controlled—no purple excess—and metaphors cohere (thundering calm, grief as shape). Minor redundancy in “amber wings” appearing twice, and slight overuse of “woven ribbon” as refrain, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—calm, inevitable, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“marched,” “glinted,” “wove”) and varied sentence structures. Information density is high—each line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats (“searing reverie of memory washing over him”) and minor synonym churn (“precision,” “exactness,” “meticulous”). No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“restore what we broke alone” / “cannot restore… alone”) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (“velveteen gloom,” “water over stones”) and pattern-taught. Minor redundancy in describing the sovereign case twice slightly dulls momentum, and “tenderly organized” appears as label without immediate action cost. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final image resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, though occasionally ornate (“shimmered with iridescent blues,” “sustaining transformation”). Minor redundancy in describing her method (“predictive modeling” appears three times). Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports momentum. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “write the future” / “writing the future.” Closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though minor overwriting occurs (“mist-shrouded hillside,” “thistled calm” risks preciousness). One paraphrase loop: “silent and forgotten” / “forgotten remember and the silenced speak.” Sentence openings vary well; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. Figurative language is coherent (dust as storyteller, stories as water) but slightly dense in mid-section. Final image (“dust would continue to whisper”) lands cleanly without scaffold. No grammar errors or simultaneity flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and controlled, with strong verbs (“weaved,” “crystallized,” “recede”) and varied sentence structures. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “shattered porcelain shards” (redundant), and two adjacent sentences restate that masks “question what reality truly meant” / “invite viewers into a dialogue with their own uncertainties.” The final third contains one paraphrase loop about safety’s mirage. These artifacts slightly dull the closure but don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “chest-deep in the murky waters that now claimed most of the sunken city ruins” advances setting, character, and theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “preserved ancient methods not merely for nostalgia but for the knowledge they offered…” followed by near-redundant lines about mathematical principles. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (no mixed metaphors). Final line’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening’s sediment motif.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density and rhythmic variation. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: “her motivation clear… to braid diverse voices” followed by near-identical restatement later. The phrase “traveled stillness” appears twice without deepening, risking scaffold repetition. Figurative language is mostly coherent, but “decay art forms contained seeds of renewal” leans toward mixed metaphor. No fatal artifacts, but minor loops prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong information density—most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional figurative density (“dust motes dancing,” “consciousness connected through soil’s network”) borders on overwriting without payoff. No paraphrase loops, but “synaptic plasticity” appears twice with minimal integration, creating slight scaffold. Closure image remains sharp despite minor texture bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gilded the lightning collection tower’s massive conductors” merges visual and thematic charge in one phrase. Sentence rhythms vary effectively, and paragraph cuts heighten momentum during the ascent. Minor overwriting appears in “cryptic riddle written in gold ink”—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “a hushed blaze,” “shard of hush,” “sanctify the spaces between memory and presence”—each phrase pulls double duty. Minor overwriting in “inadvertently profound, revealing without intention the essence of emptiness that might also be a form of presence” slightly bogs momentum with abstraction. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with the predawn walk, and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors sunrise—gradual, inevitable, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “foxglove-stained glass ampoule” merges object and symbolism economically. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. Minor overwriting in “spectral forms... faces filled with the same certainty”—could tighten. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure image (“silt that had preserved...”) perfectly echoes opening, with high information density and zero redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“mathematical proofs that might rupture his confinement” / “equations that might capture the texture”) slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is controlled (“sound like shattering glass”), but “grim optimism hardened into resolve” leans toward stock phrasing. Otherwise, clean syntax, strong verbs, and purposeful diction support propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful—each image ties to theme or character. Minor overwriting in “vivid daydreams in her sleep-deprived mind” (filter verb + abstraction), and one paraphrase loop: “forgotten scripts lay universal truths” / “lost voices spanning continents.” Sentence variety sustains momentum, and the final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure. No scaffold or momentum-dragging artifacts mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: metaphors (“whispers clinging like moss”) serve texture without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts align with emotional beats (e.g., shift to baker’s hollow). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater”) slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“spark igniting the long darkness”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: sentences vary in length and structure, advancing plot and character simultaneously (“Her clocks had always run backward… just as she now defied…”). Figurative language is purposeful (“slow exhale of low tide,” “tapestry of fate”) without muddle. Minor redundancy in “latent radiance” mentions, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“She had stepped… never run…”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“decay offering both repulsion and allure”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Overwriting appears in peak moments (“sickly, beautiful light that made my skin crawl while drawing me deeper”)—slightly mixed sensory logic. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase pair: “running from death; now, I understood how to transform the relationship.”

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“ocean into mercury”) is consistent and clarifying, not purple. Minor redundancy in “fractal generating shapes that held secrets… what lay beneath the waves” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar key beats. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors cyclical theme without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information yield per line (“salt air that permeated everything,” “whispers to him day and night”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “sunwashed dread” (used thrice) edges toward motif repetition without full payoff, and “patterns that whispered” leans slightly metaphorical in a high-stakes beat. Otherwise, syntax accelerates appropriately at the crack, and the final whistle-raising lands with clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs (“clawed,” “recapture,” “concealment”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story abstractions (“elaborate web of noble lies,” “profound human cost”), slightly diluting momentum. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize the accident’s cover-up rather than dramatizing it. Final paragraph tightens effectively, though “rescuing history from the pit of lies” echoes earlier phrasing without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “interlaced absence,” “hushed blaze,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams” avoid cliché through specificity. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Minor overwriting in “waterlogged timbers and eroded carvings” borders on stacked modifiers, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final image (“carrying... the hushed blaze”) recharges earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density (e.g., “tranquilly perceptive nature adapted quickly to the dim emergency lighting casting patches of illumination like dappled sunlight through water”). Minor redundancy appears in repeated use of “readjust” and “dappled resolve”; the latter’s recurrence edges toward motif inflation without sufficient functional evolution. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled (“architectural paradox that descended while ascending”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“theater of the past,” “vessels of hope”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph achieves earned cadence without sentimentality. Closure image (“peace… surrounded by gems yet to be polished”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and varied, with strong opening and closing lines. However, repetitive phrasing appears (“intangibly tangible” used twice identically; “bleak exhilaration” three times) and “perturbation theory” is invoked mechanically without integration into action. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats (“potential pooled like liquid light”) but occasionally veers toward mixed metaphor (“compass,” “reservoir,” “currents” competing). Minor scaffold in mid-section slows momentum, though closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, though occasionally over-reliant on figurative density (“liquid night,” “brilliant dimness” used thrice). Minor redundancy in describing the chip’s function and the drone’s path slightly dulls momentum. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. However, “perpetually surprised” recurs as a static label rather than evolving embodiment, creating a small scaffold loop.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance character, setting, and theme. Sentence openings vary (“Martin Mercer crouched…”, “The guilt-ridden…”, “His fingers trembled…”). Minor paraphrase loop in “manufactured false memories” / “fabricated family trees” and slight overuse of “sieved hush” (three mentions) create faint scaffold. No figurative muddle; metaphors cohere (shifting sands of memory, temple of trade). Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong rhythmic variation and concrete diction (“storm-worn parapet,” “waxing crescent”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “mist swirled like forgotten ghosts” followed by “furrowed hush” and “supernatural opening” creates slight metaphor bloat in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop: “untether not just the prisoners… but also both sides from years of resentments that bound them” restates the core conflict redundantly. Closure image remains clear despite minor overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “the heavy cloak of her regrets settle around her shoulders like the mist” merges atmosphere and emotion efficiently. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears (“merrily melancholic state had become her constant companion”)—a slight register lift—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every line advances character, setting, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“shattered mirrors,” “time-weathered fingers”), and sentences vary rhythmically. However, “delicately robust” appears twice as a near-tautological descriptor without evolving meaning—borderline scaffold. Also, “clean slate seeker” and “fractured underground society” verge on label-speak. No fatal loops, but slight overwriting in peak beats (“jaded wonder,” “embrace of the earth”) dilutes immediacy just enough to prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spice-scented breath forming visible glyphs” does triple duty (action, atmosphere, theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (cosmic dust → constellations → newborn wings) and payoff-clean. Avoids purple prose by grounding abstractions in sensory verbs (“drinking moonlight,” “buzzed with possibility”). One slight redundancy: “transformed herself... into something between human and something else” momentarily falters before recovering with “bridge between worlds.”

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “time had grown slippery, sliding through her fingers like the mist”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “embracing confusion could she find clarity” / “willingly perplexed” risks conceptual redundancy. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “choking beauty” borders on strained metaphor in repetition. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“spectral ghost of Earth,” “quantum energies pulsed around a temporal rift”). Minor paraphrase risk in describing the tear’s resonance twice. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final lines land with propulsion. No scaffold loops, but one or two stacked modifiers slightly blur clarity in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density: “black sand forged in fire yet cool to the touch” conveys setting, theme, and character insight. However, repetitive motifs (“vibrant hush,” “whispering hush”) border on scaffold, and “orchestrates coincidences” appears as label without dramatization. No fatal artifacts, but minor overwriting in celestial descriptions slightly dulls peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“cradle of sparks needed only the right whisper to ignite…”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow, angles as language) and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “calm inventiveness” phrasing and one paraphrase loop (“vigilant lock sentinel… guarding dangerous knowledge”) slightly dull immediacy. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure image remains sharp despite slight overwriting in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “friction had long since disappeared” implies backstory economically; “colors that defied the fading light” merges visual and conceptual. Sentence openings vary (“She had made…”, “With trembling fingers…”, “The eels…”), and paragraphs shift length to mirror ritual pacing. Minor overwriting in “impossible colors that defied the fading light”—“impossible” slightly redundant given context—but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line’s “peace in a world without friction” resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “clouds that gathered like suppressed words”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “pen scratching like the claws of something fighting to be born” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally borders on purple (“storm-kissed wonder” repeated). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent lines use “bathed... in storm-kissed wonder” / “storm-kissed wonder of existence,” triggering slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “prismatic chaos,” “dignified chaos,” “coded angles” do triple duty—image, theme, atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “mechanical arm whirring softly as he adjusted his silver cufflink”—slightly ornamental, but forgivable. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“sunlight continued its journey…”) perfectly echoes opening, closing the textural loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Strong verbs (“molted,” “forged,” “cracked”) and specific nouns (“dented coffee tin,” “whetstone,” “brittle texts”) avoid modifiers. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “luminous fracture described everything here” risks abstraction, and “cerebral cathedral” borders on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines restate the mission (“beauty the authorities couldn't burn, resistance they couldn't imprison”), slightly dulling propulsion. Closure image remains sharp despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“His music echoed through the grand concourse… swayed gently in the atmospheric currents”) that advance setting, character, and mood. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching narrative beats. Minor overwriting appears in peak moments (“steely longing manifested as art”)—slightly elevated diction that borders on label-speak—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Final line’s “unplanned encore” resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“emerald canopy stretching toward distant mountains, every flower in bloom as if celebrating…”). Minor paraphrase-loop in describing the seed’s glow across adjacent sentences. Final paragraph’s “luminous doubt” is strong, though “empirical and whimsical had once again preserved” risks abstract summary. Overall momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: “petrichor mingled with salt,” “gnarled trunks seeming to lean inward,” “prismatic colors… shifting across lace.” But occasional overwriting—“weathered fingers,” “transcendent beauty”—edges toward purple prose. Minor scaffold in “tides of remembrance” repetition (lines 4, 28, 34); not looped but slightly redundant. Final paragraph’s “true direction once more” risks abstraction, though “closed the glass case with reverence” grounds it. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, varied.
