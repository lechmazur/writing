    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with strong imagery (frost outlining wagon ruts, red rock like frozen flame). Information density is high in setting passages. However, pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "steadily adaptive" recurs three times in similar constructions; "scorched testament" appears four times with minimal variation; "purpose in the pauses" is both stated and restated. Multiple sentences open with "She + [verb]" or "The + [noun]" across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors (stars without judgment, struck bell) and therapy-speak labels ("desperate luminosity," "drifting resonance") cluster in peak beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 for loops and cadence, −0.3 for register drift. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("The scorched testament had taught her…"), triggering the disallow-9+ flag globally.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("frost flowers," "thermal cartography," "luminous cathedral"), but the concentration—metaphor in nearly every sentence—risks overwriting, especially in high-pressure beats where clarity would better serve momentum. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "that she could still create…that silence itself possessed…that music could exist." Two paraphrase loops: "the trauma that had frozen her" restates earlier cold/capsizing imagery without new pressure; "rectify" appears twice with overlapping meaning (trauma rectification, injustice rectification). Minor clarity slips and density overload lower the band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion and imagery: "ocean had opened like a wound," "geography that occupied the breath between moments," "folding the impossible space into something denser." Information density is high. Minor figurative clutter: "jagged glass cradled in her arms" + "broken lens" + "largest shard" cycles synonyms; "fractured prism" adds a fourth. "Clicking it into a fixture" underplays the climax's mechanical action when the metaphysical stakes are so high. No loops or scaffold, but the elevated register is unrelenting—one plain-syntax breath would sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the descent and delivery beats. Sentence openings are varied and propulsion is consistent. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The midnight food runs had become ritual" is immediately paraphrased by "these midnight runs" and "the midnight runs" across adjacent paragraphs, creating synonym churn. "Amplified quiet" appears three times without pattern-teaching. The closure paragraph compresses well, but earlier beats carry minor redundancy (−0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.2 for repeated anchor "midnight runs").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.9)
    Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "pilgrim of sparks," "reservoir to irrigate the deserts of abandoned affection," "bellows to fan the embers of hidden truth into flame," "circulatory system of capillary cracks." Mixed metaphors cluster—sparks/embers/fire blend with irrigation/reservoir, and the viaduct breathes yet also has capillary cracks. Paraphrase loops: "unused love...stored...withheld tenderness...stored love...unused love is stored" across three beats. Template stems recur: "She saw...She felt...She had come...She pressed...She understood." Information density is low; many sentences restate the theme without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence ("sentient pulse," "rhizomatic intelligence," "chlorophyll dreams," "palimpsest of temporal residue") without pattern-teaching or functional payoff at closure (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "temporal residue" / "texture of time" / "temporal folds" / "temporal layers" recur with synonym churn across multiple beats (−0.4). Register remains elevated throughout, limiting propulsion. The final three paragraphs repeat the dissolution concept with ornamental variation rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. However, a paraphrase loop appears in paragraph two: "Elara had to impede their entry without raising a hand against them, for she was patiently strategic, a guardian who believed that force would only breed more destruction" restates the same constraint three ways without added pressure (–0.3). The arrow's description—"feathers not from any living bird, but pressed from the seed-pods of extinct prairie grasses, arranged in a double-helix pattern that matched the genetic sequence of drought-resistant wheat"—stacks technical detail that slows momentum at a high-pressure moment. "Staggering grace" and "genetic memory" are elevated phrases that drift outside the grounded physicality of most narration.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, several lines carry elevated diction that drifts from the working scientist's idiom: "the ghosts of apples that never fell," "darker acoustics," "spectral frequencies," "sympathetic frequencies." These accumulate in the opening and middle thirds without clear pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "cells divided in her deteriorating marrow—a clock she felt rather than saw" is restated as "the cells in her blood continued their mindless division, marking time she no longer had." "The greenhouse was not a tomb but a library of silences" recaps prior material without added pressure. The closure beat is clean. Deductions: −0.6 for register drift, −0.4 for paraphrase loops = baseline ~7.9, adjusted to 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the flower-code and moonbeam descriptions. Overwriting check: figurative language saturates most sentences—"amber light that made the brass fixtures burn like small suns," "silver light fought with the painted gold," "cathedral of shadows and blue light"—without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond atmosphere; apply −0.5. Loop check: "illuminated moment" / "illuminated moments" / "golden hour" recur without functional shift; minor scaffold. Mixed metaphor: "heart pressing like a fist trying to reach through flesh to press your ear against destiny's door" conflates body parts and agency awkwardly; −0.3 coherence penalty. Stock phrase "the world blinked" in the opening; −0.2. Cumulative: −1.0 total in Q7. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or character. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "slow, deliberate, inevitable" stacks modifiers; "not prisons but possibilities, crystalline classrooms" offers paraphrase within the same sentence; "weighty lightness...heavy with meaning yet buoyant with hope" loops the same contrast. Template cadence appears in adjacent descriptors: "thoughtfully spirited," "transparent shelters," "frozen prayers." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull line-level precision, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (each paragraph advances situation and interiority). Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. Deductions accumulate: "trembling certainty" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment; "transformative betrayal that cut both ways" is abstract summary rather than enacted cost; "the rusted silence beneath indifferent stars" stacks modifiers; and the phrase "phobia-ridden survivor who understood that vulnerability was not the opposite of power, but its source" is thesis-speak that flattens the closure beat. Template cadence in the mid-section ("Their father had believed...," "Their father emerged...," "They descended...") creates rhythmic monotony. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but figurative language in high-pressure moments (stars as "crushing weight," seashell "whispering approval") tilts decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates purposeful repetition ("hush" variants, "silence" motifs) and varied sentence rhythm that supports the accumulative design. Information density is generally high, with lines like "the silence between the first foundation stone and the last...lasted forty years" doing multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "map of an endless night" / "endless night was not a destination" / "map was finished" cycles the core concept without added pressure, and phrases like "merely punctuation" / "merely a vessel" repeat the same deflating move. The metaphor of gold leaf "shedding memories like scales" mixes vehicles (botanical/reptilian) without clear coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative design. Information density is high; most lines advance image or concept. However, scaffold phrases recur: "remarkably composed" (three times), "the Second Chance Program" (three formal repetitions), and near-paraphrase loops ("amalgamate" appears five times across adjacent beats without escalating meaning). The final paragraph's "remarkably composed" feels like a template closer. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "water dripping upward" is vivid. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several runs lean toward overwriting: "the resonant hush of ventilation and settling foundations," "the timeframe after words become unnecessary, when truth could be transmitted through presence alone," and "a cathedral of resonance where secrets had no mass" stack figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in "She stepped…She placed…She spoke…She walked," a four-sentence stem run in the climax section. One paraphrase loop: "honesty opened the space" and "freed by honesty" restate the same concept within two paragraphs. Clarity remains high, and no loops obscure causality or closure, so deductions stay within the non-closure cap. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated abstraction ("statistical curves hung like visible mist," "papery ash," "river deltas or the veins of an ancient hand"). Paraphrase loops appear—paragraphs 4 and 5 both explain the deception-and-repair philosophy in adjacent summary blocks. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She + past-tense verb" or "The + noun." Synonym churn: "mended deception," "strategic dishonesty," "necessary lies" cycle without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger cumulative deductions in Q7 (−0.6 baseline for density + loops, −0.3 for template stems, total ~−0.9, plus minor register drift). Applying the non-closure accumulation cap and routing to Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "that defied the glacial winds," "a silence so profound it seemed to thicken the air itself into something measurable and dense," "lever open the barrier between moments," "validation mingling with the cold air, hope crystallizing into certainty." Figurative density stacks without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: the Drake's temporal ability is described three times in adjacent paragraphs (anticipating storms, remembering未来 events, biological clocks sliding laterally). Template cadence: "He checked... He had observed... He could capture... His hand hovered... Kael pulled." The closure image—"moments could slide sideways like skiffs across ice"—adds a late metaphor rather than recharging prior material. Artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere and situation. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the performance. Clarity remains strong through complex spatial choreography. Weaknesses: overwriting in multiple passages—"in between space where the boundary between liquid and air dissolved into silver shimmers," "hydraulic ghost finally heard"—stacks metaphor without added meaning. Paraphrase loop: "unstruck chords" concept recycled across opening, middle, and close without fresh angle. Template cadence in several beats: "She understood... She was meant to... She positioned..." Minor filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph. These artifacts don't obscure causality but reduce propulsion. Deduction: −0.8 for density issues and loops touching multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and opening/closing images are strong. Information density is high throughout, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of paragraphs 1, 4, and 6—"auroral sorrow," "luminous," "finger pointing," "swaying certainties," "vessel at sea," "watercolor washes," "skin too tight," "bruised purple," "charged particles of grief"—creating moderate overwriting that slightly dulls momentum during high-pressure beats. The accumulation doesn't fully obscure causality but adds texture where directness would sharpen. Minor filter-verb presence ("seemed to pitch," "realized she had been") is acceptable but clusters in paragraph 4. No loops or template cadence. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines doing double work (tunnel description simultaneously grounds setting and mirrors moral decay). Two areas harm momentum: the opening sentence's extended metaphor stack ("hush that followed...pressed against her eardrums, heavier than the humidity seeping from the lake") compresses three figures in quick succession without pattern-teaching, creating minor density overload (−0.3). A paraphrase-loop appears mid-story: "each bead representing a prayer or a name whispered into the dark" closely echoes the prior radio caller's description, restating without added pressure (−0.2). The final paragraph's "drowsy alertness" callback and "negative space carved from conscience and concrete" show strong figurative control, but earlier filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "felt the presence," "understood") in the tunnel-breath passage slightly dull immediacy (−0.3). Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no causality breaks. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages, but repetitive thematic phrasing appears across beats: "gripping reality loosely" recurs verbatim, "regenerative silence" is used four times, "drift of untold seasons" appears twice, and "crumbling peace" is restated. Template cadence runs of "She [verb]" openings span multiple paragraphs without taught pattern. These loops dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6). Mixed metaphor: "roots have cracked the masonry in slow, patient violence" contradicts "crumbling peace" without ironic framing (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: "water finding cracks in stone," "filament of sound," "roots dreaming," "biological time," "ordinary magic" all cluster without pattern-teaching or clear payoff differentiation. Several phrases loop conceptually: "softly adaptive" appears three times, "ordinary magic" twice, "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" bookends without meaningful reweighting. The penultimate paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "demonstrating that connection could survive even when words failed" tells what the prior beat showed. Template cadence appears in the eclipse sequence with repeated participial openers. Information density is strong in sensory detail but diluted by abstract phrasing in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose carries strong imagery ("crumbled like dead leaves," "the dragon's eye a single knot of crimson"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening two sentences both describe the silo's transformation; "sensitively perceptive" is named and then immediately restated as "biological necessity." The phrase "the bronze quiet of a world turned sideways" and later "the bronze quiet deepened" recycle the motif without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("she found," "she realized," "she felt") in the discovery sequence dull immediacy. These artifacts lower density and create minor momentum drag without fully obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, though the musical metaphors (transpose, modulate, key change) loop across paragraphs without added pressure—a mild paraphrase-loop issue. Figurative language ("tide pools filling with moonlight," "current itself") is vivid but dense in high-reflection beats, risking overwriting. No grammar errors or spatial confusion. Sentence openings vary. The final line offers resonance but edges toward thematic summarizing. Minor template cadence in the opening stems ("The method had come," "By directing flow," "After last orders") warrants −0.3 within band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high and often muddles clarity: "stillness as one might frame a portrait," "air grew heavy with the texture of unraveled stillness," "rhetorical device locking into place like tumblers of a safe." Mixed metaphors and register drift into academic abstraction ("employing antimetabole," "aporia to force the entity into logical paralysis") appear frequently, especially in peak beats, triggering deductions for overwriting and coherence. Paraphrase loops are present—"the muffled clarity resolved into pure understanding" restates earlier concepts without advancing pressure. Template cadence ("He dipped...He continued...He worked...He stood") across multiple sentences reduces propulsion. Line-level opacity in the closure paragraph ("accountable, articulated quiet") dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstract figuration ("upturned hush," "pregnant silence," "visible chords and melodies made manifest in color"). Mixed metaphors appear ("ice sang," "silence between notes," "chronological homesickness"). Template cadence in paragraph three: "Each mapped memory emitted...the summer of his seventh year sang...the winter of his father's departure resonated..." Paraphrase loops recur (fortune-writing backstory restated across multiple beats). Density penalty (−0.5), coherence penalty for mixed vehicles (−0.5), and loop penalty (−0.4) in Q7 only; no separate causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstraction ("impossible timeframe where a raindrop hung suspended between cloud and puddle," "fractured timelines visible at the edge of her vision"), creating density without clarity. Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "[concept] that [elaboration]" structures repeat. Paraphrase loops summarize the same self-integration idea in adjacent lines. Filter verbs and nominalizations dull immediacy. The closure beat—tablet crumbling, tattoos pulsing—is buried in abstract phrasing ("her selves finally unified into one gravity-defying truth") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful in most beats. However, the piece exhibits template cadence in the final third: "She felt...She understood...She reached...Elara reached" creates stem-repetition. Mixed metaphor: "drum skin...beneath the phonograph's horn" and "needle dropped into the groove" imply the needle contacts the cylinder record, not the drum, creating spatial confusion at the closure mechanism. "Filament of hush" is invoked multiple times without evolving pressure. The phrase "audibly muted" is repeated as both an attribute and a descriptor without variation, edging toward synonym loop.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats approaches overwriting: "shadows pooled like ink," "specific gravity of surveillance," "coiling in her chest," "velvet silence" cluster without clear pattern-teaching. Several phrases loop conceptually: "lateral evasion" / "progressing laterally" / "lateral and inevitable" / "lateral path" recurs without functional escalation. The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("greenhouse for facts," "integrity that required no witness but the wind") where simpler image work would sharpen closure. Clarity remains intact but momentum occasionally stalls under lyric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and several images are striking ("frayed ends whispering against the clay in rhythms that matched his breathing"). However, multiple sentences loop conceptually—repeating the poet's stance on ambiguity and refusal across adjacent beats without adding new pressure—and a few figurative phrases in high-density clusters ("pulsed," "shimmer," "danced in frequencies") risk overwriting. The closure beat remains clear, capping non-closure artifact penalties, but pervasive near-paraphrase and filter verbs ("understood," "wondered," "seemed") in reflective passages lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("the world had swallowed its own tongue," "rusted ribs creating a cathedral of decay"). However, the piece suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She gathered driftwood... She drew her bow... She was unbinding... She played..." clusters identical sentence stems across the performance sequence. Stock phrases recur without reweighting: "magnificent simplicity" appears three times, "chronic hush" five times, "acoustically perceptive" twice, often as near-synonyms for the same idea. The final third stacks redundant thematic restatements ("honor the broken," "praise the partial," "incomplete, resonant, and radiantly undone") that dull momentum. Information density is high in places but scaffolding churn ("not to restore... but to honor," "not what should be... but what is") flattens propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is vivid and controlled with strong figurative language ("amber grotto breathed," "silk around a knife"). Information density is high in the transformation beats. However, template cadence appears: "Kael [verb]" stems run across multiple sentences ("Kael stood," "Kael withdrew," "Kael understood," "Kael applied," "Kael felt," "Kael stepped," "Kael looked"), creating mechanical rhythm in the first half. Paraphrase loop: "professionally thorough" appears three times without variation, flattening momentum. The blotter petal's description is vivid but the chemistry exposition ("synthetic compound," "chemical mimicry of compassion") abstracts rather than grounds the moment. Closure beats are clean and propulsive. Apply template-cadence penalty and paraphrase-loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., paragraphs 10–11 restate the foundation concept without advancing pressure) and elevated diction that obscures immediacy ("whimsically attentive," "cycles of compassion," "vessels of gratitude"). Template cadence appears in repeated abstract noun phrases across beats (−0.6). Several sentences exceed their informational load with ornamental modifiers. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses rather than delivering a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language density is high throughout ("fruit hung like frozen starlight," "voice breaking with luminescent ache"), creating a lyric texture but occasionally obscuring causality in peak beats. The final paragraph's paraphrase loop ("webs of kinship tightened, crystallized, became permanent structures" restates the prior bridge image without added pressure) and template cadence in the opening (repeated "who" clauses for eight inhabitants) dull momentum. Stock metaphors ("spider silk," "sugar in rain") and the therapy-adjacent "graft oneself onto community" reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences prioritize ornament over advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer world-building, action, and metaphor. However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "acoustic womb from which all reverberations first breathed before they learned to fade and die" and "eating its own tail in endless hunger" cluster figurative language without earned payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed time that didn't belong to her" followed immediately by "she was borrowing time," and "the universe demanded payment in symmetry, in balance, in the precise accounting" restates the debt concept. Template cadence in the opening third: "She touched... She needed... Her fingers trembled... She spoke..." Apply −0.6 for density + loop issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: "ambiguous loss that refused to solve itself, leaving him suspended between mourning and waiting" is restated multiple times in different phrasing. Figurative language is dense but often mixed ("dovetail the geometry of grief with the calculus of hope," "threading the needle between acceptance and faith"). Template cadence appears in reflection: "The orchard remained underground, and his sister remained missing, yet he had mapped…" Stock metaphors ("bending space around absence like light around gravity") appear without fresh inflection. Proximity to the closure image mitigates severity but prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the second paragraph explains that fragments are "not merely obsolete media; they were vessels of sense memory" and then immediately restates "preserving not just words but the breath, the hesitation…" in adjacent lines. The phrase "methodically, kindly" recurs across paragraphs as a template stem. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "pipe chases that ran like arteries," "curled like metallic insects." The final paragraph contains a soft scaffold: "her work would remain, magnetic memories humming in the walls, waiting for the hands that needed to find them" paraphrases the prior distribution without adding pressure. Applying the paraphrase-loop and template-cadence checks: −0.6 cumulative in Q7. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("glass cathedral of domination," "weather pattern" as metaphor for metamorphosis), but stacks in adjacent sentences without breathing room: the moss paragraph layers "not by directing...but by surrendering" immediately after "not in defiance...but in accommodation." Paraphrase loops appear: "reluctant metamorphosis" is rephrased as "uncomfortable and necessary," then "reluctant" reappears in paragraph 16, and "sustaining transformation" is repeated in the final two paragraphs. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" openings across paragraphs 8–10, 14, 22–24. Information density is high, but scaffold phrases ("with the circuitously sincere clarity of someone who") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentences anchor voice and world. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or world-building. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("salt ate her canvases," "gray ribbon," "golden coffin"). Two areas reduce clarity: "cataloging erosion" and "thresh meaning from experience" repeat the same metaphor across beats without added pressure, creating mild conceptual redundancy. The final paragraph's "terrible, exhausted clarity" and "stories we tell to keep the water at bay" border on summary-of-theme rather than pure image. No major loops or template cadence, but figurative density in non-peak beats nudges toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is often lyric and purposeful ("silver laughter echoing from impossibly distant corners"), but figurative density pervades without clear pattern-teaching: "bright darkness," "oil on water," "melody made mineral," "ripples in the air...humming lullabies to the stone" all appear within tight quarters. Template cadence runs appear: "Elara watched," "Elara realized," "Elara understood," "Elara touched" across key beats. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" recurs three times as a label without evolving. Synonym loops: "transformation"/"miracle," "witnessed"/"anchor," "anticipating"/"foresight." These artifacts cluster in the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "pale stones resembling bones" anchors setting and theme). However, paraphrase loops appear: "compile fragments into meaning" recurs verbatim across beats without reweighting; "staggered intervals" is repeated mechanically; "navigated absences" becomes a stock phrase. The final paragraph stacks abstract concepts ("enduring connection," "loss became legible," "meaning does not arrive whole") that summarize rather than propel. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("He saw the moment… the valve sticking, the note dying") flattens momentum. These artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure, so penalties remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "fortress of unspoken truths" is spatial metaphor, then clarified as "infinite archive"; "locomotive constructed of forgotten appointments and midnight confessions" strains coherence. Template cadence appears in paired clauses ("not steel but suggestion," "analyzing…recognizing," "waiting for…training her") across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: the cracks "guide her feet" and "form arrows that pointed deeper" within adjacent lines. Stock phrases ("every fiber," "heart hammered…in Morse code," "trembling certainty") recur. Propulsion is uneven: the middle third stacks description (punch, train, ticket) without forward movement. Readability remains high but information density is diluted by synonym churn and scaffolding connectors.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("copper-green comet," "burned cold, then warm"), but the piece exhibits multiple line-level artifacts: paraphrase loops ("creating a sanctuary where...could briefly touch" / "sculpting...a space where...could finally be heard together"), template cadence in the vision sequence, and stock metaphors ("falling stars," "heartbeat"). Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("understood that," "realized her skepticism"). The final third accumulates synonym churn ("transcribed...translated...mapped") that dulls propulsion. Deductions: −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks = baseline ~6.9, further lowered to 6.1 for artifacts touching closure gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is often striking ("hushed thunder," "quantum strings that defined departure itself vibrating"). Overwriting is evident: nearly every sentence in the climax deploys figurative or elevated language without breathing room ("topology of continuance," "magnetic signature of what came after"). Some paraphrase loops appear: "dimensionally aware" is restated multiple times across the opening third; "spatial mutiny" and "rebellious space" recur without fresh pressure. Template cadence is minimal, but density in peak beats obscures causal momentum slightly, per the overwriting check.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant loop and scaffold issues undermine momentum. "Deathly vitality" appears three times as a thematic label without earned variation. Paraphrase loops: "waiting actively" is restated across multiple paragraphs; the ink pot's effects are described, then re-described. Sentence stems repeat: "She had always been," "She understood that," "Maya recognized." The final third stacks conceptual claims—"radical honesty required," "waiting actively required," "the mathematics of a fair trade demanded"—in place of scene pressure. Register drifts into philosophical abstraction ("liquefied rigid thinking," "absolutism dissolving like sugar") that clashes with the prep-room immediacy. Template cadence is evident in the closing sequence of declarative will-statements.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"roots gripping stone like frozen lightning," "prisms against the walls, each spectrum containing a ghost"—which risks overwriting but remains mostly coherent. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions and parallel "the [noun] of [year/day/laughter]" phrases. Information density is strong; most lines serve multiple functions (world, character, theme). The final beat's propulsion is clean, but earlier passages loop conceptually (invented histories restated across several paragraphs) without adding pressure, triggering modest line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent (rust as accretion, containers as identity vessels, tides as rhythm), but several lines veer into overwriting: "the porous boundary between living and being archived" and "the texture of velvet—soft, dense, hiding something precious" stack metaphors without clear causal pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs ("They understood that memory was not recollection but accretion, the way rust layers upon metal, the way containers stack..."). Paraphrase loops occur: the third-to-last and second-to-last paragraphs restate the layering/texture thesis with minor variation. Information density is high, but momentum occasionally stalls under figurative weight. No grammatical errors; syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled. Significant paraphrase loop detected: paragraphs four and five restate the theme of myth-becoming with synonym variation ("retell," "reimagine," "variations on a theme") without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "she smiled, understanding… she placed… she walked" uses parallel stems across three consecutive moves. These artifacts dull momentum at closure, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The raft city of Carnevale had never known silence" establishes setting, character history, and current tension). However, several passages loop conceptually: the dual allegiance is restated three times in the opening (lapel badge vs. grandmother's tokens, boardroom vs. salt-crusted community, straddling worlds), and "orderly intuitive" is both told as trait and then explained as "mapping complex systems while her gut read emotional currents." The phrase "hopeful desperation" appears twice, once as label and once as embodied "rise in her chest like tide water"—the second instance is stronger but the repetition signals scaffold. Figurative language occasionally stacks without adding pressure: "threatening and buoyant all at once" reads as decorative balance. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density and propulsion; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Rhythm varies appropriately—longer technical exposition early, tighter syntax during the cold vigil, measured cadence at closure. Minor overwriting in the opening: "blinding lunar glare" and "moonlit peak" in consecutive sentences create mild redundancy, and "blue marble drowning in black velvet" is a stock Earth-from-space image. The phrase "made her heart seem thunderous in its cage" approaches cliché. No major loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the Earth paragraph slightly exceeds the surrounding pressure level.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and moves the action forward, but several patterns reduce density and propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("the sound resonated...signaling" restates "the horn sounded"), and stock metaphors accumulate ("spider-webbed," "breathing rhythm," "seabed of her guilt"). The final paragraph especially stacks abstractions: "magnetic calm settled deeper," "weight of purpose fulfilled, heavy and real and anchoring," "transformed broken signals into guidance, darkness into direction." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She placed...She had built...She needed...She released"). The technical repair sequence maintains clarity but several beats offer atmospheric restatement rather than advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high; most lines advance setting, method, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, though a handful of openings recycle structure ("He was," "He stood," "He removed," "He punched"). The phrase "worrying tranquility" appears three times, creating mild template echo. Figurative language (condensation as braille, world folding like a paper map, falcon's gaze accusatory) is coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor overwriting: "the unseeable into grid lines and legend" and "the civilized world" edge toward elevated diction without undercutting clarity. Grammar and sequence are clean; no ambiguity or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Paraphrase loops appear: "infinitely patient" (twice within four lines), "wild hush" (three times), and the cobblestones/footsteps/rhythm cluster repeats without new detail. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences. Figurative density is purposeful and pattern-taught (rhythm, resonance, tuning motifs), but "pregnant with the possibility of return" and "held breath about to become a name" edge into stock metaphor. Clarity remains intact; momentum flags briefly in the reflection on merchant greed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    Recurring phrases—"gathered hush" (four instances), "lonesome splendor" (three), "ephemeral" (six), "touched memories" (three)—create intentional motif pattern but border on template cadence in peak beats. "The gathered hush intensified until she could hear her own heartbeat synchronizing with the temple's dormant machinery" stacks abstractions. Mixed metaphor: "eddies that seemed to unsnarl themselves only to retangle" anthropomorphizes water illogically. Paraphrase loop: "override instinct" / "overriding instinct" / "overridden the instinct" across three paragraphs. Information density is high in the dive sequence but the apartment coda adds redundancy without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.6)
    Heavy metaphor density without pattern-teaching or payoff: "copperlight repose," "scuffs on a narrow door," "lattice...breaking wind into manageable fictions," "rope of lies strong enough to climb," "chasing hush," "thread a labyrinth with your own story"—most appear once, ornamentally. Template cadence in paragraph 3: "that the cellar held wine...that he was simple...that the boy who cried wolf's son..." (three parallel "that" clauses). "Sustains impossibilities" repeats twice without functional shift. Propulsion is steady but information density is diluted by figurative surplus. Peak beat (hovering, descent) remains clear but the metaphor stack in earlier paragraphs drags momentum without accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "lovingly venomous, honey wrapped around broken glass," "the ecstasy of recognition and the agony of ancestral guilt flooding his nervous system like alchemical quicksilver," and "mournful elation of the repaid echoing in his chest like a second heart learning to beat" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen the moment. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "gratitude mixed with goodbye, sorrow inseparable from release" and "beautiful and deadly and brief" deploy parallel construction mechanically. Paraphrase loop: "resonant awakenings" is named three times across the text without distinct meaning shifts, and "ephemeral cameo appearances" is repeated verbatim in beats that restate rather than advance. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is lyric and image-rich, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "She sought to carve a path from ruin to reverence, stitching together the fractured history" is immediately followed by "With orchid solace threading through her heart, Maren pierced the stone itself"—two lines restating her mission without advancing it. Runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Maren [verb]" create rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("spider-webbed across the ancient walls," "arterial red") and elevated diction ("liturgy," "amphitheater," "evolution") cluster without earning their weight. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes, and the closure paragraph ("the path from ruin to reverence had been carved...") explains rather than showing the image. No single artifact breaks causality, but the accumulation dulls momentum and obscures the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and concrete sensory anchors (femurs, vertebrae, pitted granite). Information density is high, with most lines advancing setting, character, or theme. However, several passages loop conceptually: "interrupted journey" appears four times across similar constructions (cousin/aunt/father), and "cautious enchantment" / "warmly curious" recur as labels rather than evolving through action. The phrase "warmly curious" in particular ("her hands moved warmly curious," "warmly curious insistence") reads as template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; no major clarity breaks. Minor scaffold: "Each tree marked an interrupted journey" followed immediately by three parallel examples without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and vivid images ("angular black bird with pneumatic tubes for talons"). However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "The clipboard felt lighter now, its burden transferred" echoes the opening's "clipboard that felt heavy"; "already composing... already searching" is a template cadence. Stock metaphors cluster: "archaeologist brushing dust from fossilized bone," "ultimate subversion," "cathedral to tactile experience." These accumulate in the final third, dulling momentum. Information density is high in the decoding sequence but reflective paragraphs (surface mail as subversion, anonymity requiring artifacts) tell more than they show. Apply −0.8 for loops and stock phrasing touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "harmless as a moth circling dull flame," "timelines brushing close to this one like ghosts breathing on glass," "stories that existed only in gaps between words." While individually vivid, the metaphor layer rarely pauses, risking decorative accumulation in a high-concept piece where clarity of method matters. A few constructions lean ornamental ("the Candle Keeper's quadrant is wrong" as pure setup feels slightly scaffolded). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax varies purposefully. Momentum holds, but line-level clarity would benefit from one or two beats of plain declaration amid the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and no clear loops. However, density suffers from decorative figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats: "bloom into fog that swallowed the mangrove darkness," "timeframe where an apology waits unspoken," "lunar influence," "liminal eddy," "pocket of time folded upon itself like wet origami." Mixed metaphors appear ("wounds shimmered silver, flesh knitting") where moonlight both shimmers and knits without a clear vehicle. The final beat stacks abstractions—"circuit of love interrupted," "healing the wound of absence"—that tell theme rather than anchor in concrete image. Filter verbs ("watched her breath bloom," "saw herself," "observed this transformation") cluster in the opening third, dulling immediacy. Paragraph cut test: the third paragraph (moonlight healing) could be removed without altering knowledge or stakes, as the trait is never leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "breathing thing of vapor," "chemical surrender," "calcium channels reminding her of neural networks," "lotus-hearted ache," "carrying the smudged lexicon of fear in her own marrow." In the middle beats, metaphors stack without clear propulsion, creating textural richness at the cost of momentum. Template cadence appears in paragraph-opening stems: "She turned it over… She leaned closer… She recognized… She began to unknot… She understood… She had come… She would tell." Paraphrase loop: "converting isolation into shared ritual, turning the fragment of a broken reef into a promise of grafted wholeness" restates the prior sentence's content. No text artifacts touch the closure image directly, but pervasive density and loops lower the score by −0.8 to −1.0 in mid-passage.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with strong individual images ("fog curled like stale wool," "silver halides eager to receive new information"). Information density is high in the opening third; middle beats begin paraphrasing the same creative rekindling across multiple sentences ("shadows that crept into her workshop and silenced her brushes" / "years of ash" / "darkness lately"). Template cadence appears in the film-hanging, pigment-opening, painting sequence where each beat follows "Then she [verb]" structure. The photographic metaphor system (exposed, latent, developer's tray, sensitive) recurs with purpose but borders on over-saturation in the final third. Figurative language clusters densely without always advancing pressure: "dissolving like sugar in tea," "folded like soft dough," "like prayer flags" within close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "nested awakenings" appears four times, "methodically playful" three times, each usage restating rather than advancing. Figurative language stacks without coherence—"possibility hums," "question mark made of earth," "sonic womb gestating new ways of hearing"—creating mixed metaphors (how does a garden gestate hearing?). Register drift into abstract academic phrasing ("colonized the territory where certainty once stood guard") clashes with the POV. The final third is dense with scaffold ("each realization containing the seed of the next"), triggering artifact penalties (−1.2) and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm, but several artifacts dull momentum: paraphrase loops ("secret language club...communicating through root systems" restates "message patterns in...marigolds and thyme"), template cadence in the opening beats ("His pockets held...its dried seeds whispering"), and stacked modifiers without fresh specificity ("charming rogue scholar," "candidly cryptic people"). The final paragraph's "knowledge that somewhere, a beanstalk spelled out liberty" hedges into exposition rather than trusting the moth image alone. No major clarity breaks, but density suffers from synonym churn ("fragile ecosystem," "frost of authoritarian control") and filter verbs at pressure points ("understood his motivation").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and imagery is often layered—"the calcium carbonate of loss," "smoke through cathedral rafters"—but figurative density appears in most sentences without always advancing causality, triggering mild overwriting. Some paraphrase loops appear: "her pain, once sharp enough to cut steel, had dissolved into nutrients" echoes the earlier photosynthesize-pain-into-beauty formulation. Template cadence is minimal, and the piece avoids scaffold, but elevated diction ("ensconse," "polyps," "bioluminescence") occasionally clashes with the intimate scale of grief. The final paragraph sustains momentum and the closing image is clean, keeping line-level issues from touching closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "cloud-mist," "frozen moonlight," "violet nostalgia," "rusted triumph," "foxglove regret" stack without functional payoff. Sentence openings show some variety, though "She [verb]" recurs frequently in the second half. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("gently systematic" echoed, "deserted marvels" repeated). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the caretaker's return, flattening momentum. Template cadence is noticeable in the middle third ("She walked… She understood… She climbed… She positioned… She tapped").

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level clarity is high; no grammatical errors or ambiguous references. However, multiple sentences loop conceptually: "silence fell between them" / "mutual quiet had been no accident" / "let silence metastasize" restates the problem across three beats without adding pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "She moved… She selected… She arranged… She began" stacks identical stems without purposeful effect. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed: ink "chimed like struck crystal" (auditory) then "dried in the air, solidifying into a bridge of light" (visual/tactile)—the metaphor vehicle shifts mid-image. Opening and closing lines are strong, but scaffold phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") recurs without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Information density is high; nearly every clause advances setting or stakes. However, the prose suffers from pervasive overwriting: figurative language ("stone ribs expanding," "whisper rather than roar," "dappled resolve," "conspiracies of kindness") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating decorative drag. Template cadence runs appear ("he had worked," "he had discovered," "he had risked," "he would not authorize") and synonym loops recur (tremor/tremble, breath/exhale/sigh). Mixed metaphors cluster: the amphitheater simultaneously "groans," "breathes," and "sighs," blurring coherence. The final third remains ornate where compression would serve momentum. Baseline −0.8 for density overload, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high; the opening efficiently establishes setting and method. However, multiple lines loop thematically without advancing action: "blooming withering" appears twice in similar phrasing, "paper trails" is restated in adjacent beats, and several reflective sentences paraphrase the same idea (reinvention dissolving, trust replacing fear) across the final third. A run of "She [verb]" stems in the middle third (She understood, She stood, She touched, She could, She whispered, She watched, She imagined, She remained) creates template cadence. The metaphor "dust motes…each particle a fragment of forgotten stories" is evocative but borders on stock lyricism. Applying the paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties: −0.6 baseline, escalated slightly because artifacts appear in the closure section.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "spectral geometries," "cartographer reading braille," "bow to one another without touching," "congregation of herself" cluster in adjacent lines, muddling rather than sharpening sense (−0.5). "Featherly determined" in the opening and "fractured hush" in the final paragraph read as stock literary ornament. Two paraphrase loops: the second paragraph's "lost child" claim and "necessary distances" recur in the third paragraph with synonym variation but no added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the sequence "She had found…She ran…She stood…She approached…She placed," relying on subject-verb-object stems without syntactic variety (−0.4). Information density is high in the grain-analysis beat, but scaffolding phrases ("she realized," "she understood now") externalize epiphany rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting clusters in peak beats: "watching starlight fracture through the currents in patterns only a landscape astrologer could interpret" and "shadowseam wonder—that peculiar awe found only in places where light and abyss intertwined" stack figurative language without causal propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "belonging was not a place to inhabit but a frequency to match" followed by "a resonance between separate souls," and "some connections burn brief and bright...transient, yet eternal in their patterning." Template cadence runs in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" and "They [verb]" stems. Mixed metaphor: "hours dissolved like salt" clashes with the underwater setting where salt is already dissolved. The final third carries −0.8 for stacked artifacts (therapy-speak labels, paraphrase loops) that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repeated phrases ("scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird" appears nearly verbatim four times; "before memory fades" three times; "cheerful gloom" four times; "crater glass" nine times) create paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Template cadence: "She [verb]" / "Elara [verb]" runs across a dozen sentences without variation. Stock metaphors ("like mist," "like breaking waves," "like home") and synonym churn ("transliterate," "conjecture," "recollection") cluster without adding pressure. Information density is low—many sentences restate thematic claims rather than advance situation. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but paraphrase loops and thematic scaffolding appear: "ordered randomness," "calculated wilderness," "engineered space," "orchestrated serendipity" recycle the same core idea across multiple beats without advancing pressure (−0.6 for template-cadence and synonym churn). Filter verbs ("He noted," "He understood," "He had watched") stack in expository passages, dulling immediacy. The phrase "lightly attentive" repeats verbatim as a label without fresh embodiment. Peak moments—music box release, woman's tears—rely on assertion rather than sensory propulsion. Grammar and mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade. Multiple sentences restate the same transformation concept without advancing pressure: "She was no longer merely a skilled tide dancer... She had become the tide itself" directly follows "she was fledging into something new, neither fully mortal nor celestial." Runs of "she [verbed]" structures dominate. Stock metaphors ("stars shifted slightly," "wrapped in twilight and cosmic ink") and mixed metaphors ("magnetic sorrow") reduce clarity. The phrase "spontaneously anchored" appears three times with identical phrasing. Figurative density in the final third obscures rather than sharpens the transformation image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and figurative language is purposeful (prism as metaphor for experience, ripples for consequence), yet several beats loop: "before everything shifts" appears twice, "read between lines" recurs without added pressure, and "clear complexity" is stated rather than demonstrated. The opening's "turning in his mind like glass against the grinding wheel" is vivid, but "as mercury" and "like a crystal lung" in close succession risk mixed vehicle logic (mercury is liquid/reflective, crystal is solid/geometric). Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports scene needs, yet the phrase "the reflective harbor glazier" in mid-story feels like an appositive inserted to re-anchor identity—functional but mechanical. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, and the final image propels cleanly, but the decorative cluster of "noctilucent reckonings" (used thrice) and "clear complexity" (title echo) suggests ornamental rather than causal recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, several beats suffer from overwriting: "the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears three times; "gently skilled" recurs as a phrase anchor; and lines like "burns mapping constellations that rivaled the stars wheeling overhead during the slow dance of celestial bodies" stack metaphors without advancing pressure. The opening sentence runs long with nested clauses that slightly obscure the anchor (Maya walking). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent paragraphs: "She had carried it through two decades" / "She had spent twenty years carrying the weight" restates without added detail. The propulsion is steady but the figurative density in high-pressure beats (Maya's confession, the marble exchange) competes with clarity. No fatal artifacts, but the template cadence of elevated metaphor + body detail + cosmic image recurs enough to feel algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language pervades without respite: "tide-polished grotto...smooth as glass," "chamber that existed simultaneously across parallel timelines like a stone skipped across still ponds," "dandelion seeds," "incoming and outgoing, present in all its versions at once." Multiple sentences loop conceptually—"decorations were not merely ornamental but functional," then "decorations acting as beacons"—without advancing cause or effect. Template cadence runs appear: "She had spent years...She moved methodically...She adjusted her patterns...She had solved the equation." Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("She felt the weight," "Elara watched," "Elara checked"), dulling immediacy. These artifacts spread across the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies appropriately, and sensory detail is vivid. However, pattern artifacts accumulate: "burden of legacy" appears three times, "ivy-veiled passage" recurs mechanically, and several phrases loop conceptually ("walls remember/witness/dream"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "She entered... She descended... She climbed... She pressed... She packed... She stepped." Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure: "ghost of color in a gray world," "topography of memory," "corridor echoed with footsteps that had ceased." Some filter-verb stacking ("she could almost hear," "she realized," "she understood") dulls immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("She carried the past so the walls could finally rest") tells rather than showing the cost through image or action. Information density is generally high, but scaffold phrases and synonym churn (discover/glimpse/understand, burden/legacy/cost) drag momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("twilight pooled between the stone columns like ink," "spectral ladders," "dusky harmony shattered into a thousand ringing fragments") without sufficient pattern-teaching or payoff; multiple adjacent sentences in the opening and middle beats layer metaphor upon metaphor, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "His borrowed heartbeat began to falter" followed immediately by "Elias sang faster… even as his medium threatened to dissolve" restates urgency without advancing action (−0.2). Clarity remains navigable, but momentum is dulled by ornamental phrasing ("creature who existed only in the refraction between rain and memory") that does not propel causality. Combined artifact deductions and high filter-verb presence ("began to hum," "remained stubborn," "began to sing") in peak beats disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—sentences layer setting, backstory, and thematic weight efficiently. Clarity remains strong through spatial choreography and causal sequence. However, repeated phrase stems create template cadence: "operatively gentle" appears three times, "slow dance of celestial bodies" four times, "ritual significance" three times, "forever war" three times. The clipboard functions as motif but its recurring description ("ebony," "ancient stone," "flawed beauty") borders on synonym churn. Stock metaphors (blood-soaked valley, velvet sky, stately procession) and elevated diction (midsummer, celestial convergence, collateral damage) occasionally inflate texture without fresh specificity. No loops obscure causality, but the patterned recurrence and elevated register in peak beats lower line-level score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("bruised sky," "broken mirror," "acoustic shadow"). However, several beats show overwriting: "a determination to preserve not the species themselves, which was impossible, but the echo of their existence, the acoustic shadow of their calls" loops conceptually without adding pressure. Paraphrase appears in adjacent paragraphs (manufactured drought explained twice in paragraphs 1 and 3). Minor template cadence in the backstory exposition. The closure image is clean, but mid-story density occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is lyric and ambitious, with vivid images ("flakes fell like ash from a silent burning," "shadows moved like living ink"). However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bodily poetic" appears three times; "lullaby of conformity" twice; figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff ("verses in the air," "calligraphy against the white expanse," "temporal threshold," "fourth-dimensional tangles"). Mixed metaphors: "her virginity a blade she whetted against the lullaby" conflates weapon and song incoherently. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("flux," "temporal filaments," "accumulated stillness") clashes with the POV's immediate sensory experience. Paraphrase loop: "bodily poetic" is restated as "each gesture bodily poetic and deliberate" within one sentence. Template cadence is mild but present (several sentences open with participial phrases). Applying −0.8 for density and coherence overwriting, −0.4 for mixed metaphor and register drift, totaling −1.2 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("bodily poetic grace" in the final sentence), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "memories like furniture in a dark room," "meteor hush," "liminal glow," "story enter his bloodstream like a toxin or sacrament," "reverse motion…of intent." In peak beats (argument aftermath, storyteller encounter, burning), nearly every sentence carries metaphor, creating register drift and slowing propulsion. Template cadence appears: "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" opens multiple sentences. Paraphrase loop: "epiphany arrived incomplete and trembling" / "second half-lit epiphany followed" restates the two-part structure without added pressure. Clarity remains intact but momentum sags under ornament. No major grammatical errors; pronoun references track.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated imagery (blushing stillness, interrupted cadence, verdant grotto, rose-gold dawn)—which creates a static lyric texture rather than momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "transiently rooted" recurs without reweighting, and the build-signal-release cycle is restated multiple times. Template cadence: runs of similar participial openers and "the [noun] [verb]" constructions flatten rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines perform atmospheric work but do not advance situation or narrow options. Clarity remains high—no opacity—but the steady decorative register and repetitive phrasing ("interrupted cadence" used for wings, towers, and journey) trigger artifact deductions. Strong specificity in some images (chitin's give, proboscis tasting nectar) partially offsets.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer craft detail with emotional stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent. However, overwriting appears throughout: "snowmelt ardor had thawed the glaciers in her chest, turning frozen regret into flowing purpose" stacks three metaphors for one concept. "Each perforation a letter in a name, a note in a life, a breath suspended in paper" repeats the pattern. The final two paragraphs loop thematically—"reconfigured like rope, translated like memory, held in light rather than sound" restates what prior action showed, creating paraphrase drag. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" across the middle section. These artifacts appear in peak beats and touch closure, triggering the artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 plus −0.3 for final-third presence, total −1.1 applied here.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, sometimes approaching over-saturation in high beats ("roots transcend soil by accepting its darkness," "rain hammering…in a language older than the bunker"). Some paraphrase loops appear: "decaying directive" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and the final third contains scaffold phrases ("the directive had decayed because it was finished with her, passing her along…"). Clarity holds, but information density dips when poetic restatement substitutes for new action. No outright artifacts or filter-verb stacks, yet the figurative load in the closure paragraph slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the climax, but the piece carries noticeable overwriting: "empirically ironic" appears twice as a label, "schematic representations" recurs without variance, and figurative language clusters densely ("drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations," "bled across," "groaned around him") without always clarifying. The opening's "oil drops...tallow candles...three simultaneously" sequence is precise and propulsive, but mid-story phrases like "devotion so ancient it predated language" and "immeasurable longing" edge toward stock abstraction. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and the final beat—"finally spending everything he had saved"—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the shifting grace of neutrality, the suspended animation of potential before choice, before the first blow was struck" stacks abstract phrases without concrete anchors. Paraphrase loops appear ("cellular memory" referenced six times across adjacent lines; "shifting grace" recurs without accumulated meaning). Template cadence: "The sanctuary [verb]" opens three sentences in the climactic paragraph. Stock metaphors: "gravity that warped the sanctuary's edges," "cathedral coded into DNA." Register drift into pseudo-scientific/spiritual diction ("genetic recollection of every organism," "primordial peace before the first conflict divided self from other") clashes with the action frame. The final line—"the broken music that had, at last, completed its song"—offers lyric closure but earlier scaffolding dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fog grew teeth of ice," "smoke made architecture," "glass forgot it was separate from the blower's lungs") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating accumulative texture that occasionally obscures action sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "the boundary between maker and made began to dissolve" echoes prior "erasing boundaries" phrasing without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports mood, but information density suffers from ornamental layering in peak beats. No outright grammatical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high (each line advances setting, character, or theme), and rhythm modulates well (long descriptive opener, tighter action mid-passage, breath at twilight). Two loop artifacts: "breach" recurs five times (breach of contract, breaches could not be mended, breach into bounty) with synonym churn that dulls the closure callback; "sacred" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence in the tool-list paragraph (comma-stacked inventory) briefly stalls momentum. The final image ("a mender who had finally learned...") risks moralizing summary but stays tied to the quartz-rainbow visual, partially redeeming it. Deduct −0.6 for loops touching closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.1)
    Density is high but clarity suffers from stacked abstractions ("simply complicated," "narrative limbo," "recursive logic," "brightened disquiet") and paraphrase loops—e.g., paragraphs 2, 10, and 15 all restate that Elara has inherited something nonlinear she has already experienced. Template cadence appears in multiple "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphors: "dawn through stained glass" applied to "disquiet" conflates light with emotion incoherently. Applying −0.8 for loops and −0.4 for metaphoric muddle in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without rhythmic variation: "temporal wake rippling," "vertiginous darkness," "semantic voids where translation failed and meaning pooled like water," "chemical symphonies," "conceptual frameworks those lives had generated." In the closure sequence, stacked metaphors ("garden of crystallized errors, each blade of grass a failed hypothesis, each tree a civilization's abandoned wisdom growing in impossible directions") blur rather than sharpen the final image. Template cadence appears in repeated participial openers and "the manner in which" constructions. Paraphrase loop: "the time traveler's disruption had altered the exchange rate" / "the time traveler's arrival had fractured the mountain's organizational logic." Register remains consistently elevated without purposeful modulation, creating a wall of ornate prose that flattens momentum. No clear propulsion in sentence rhythm; each line accumulates decoration rather than driving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout, with vivid imagery (fog as ink, planks as pages, narrative threads as spider silk). However, sustained metaphor saturation without causal grounding creates overwriting: nearly every sentence carries figurative language, blurring the line between vehicle and tenor ("the ship had always been a story, and stories are blissfully aberrant things"). Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "they" constructions and scaffold phrasing ("finding in the garden not an ending but a beginning"). Paraphrase loops occur (e.g., "to recapture was not to return…but to weave what remained" restates the same idea). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.0 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant line-level issues accumulate. Multiple sentences stack participial openers and "as" constructions that create template cadence: "As an adaptable archivist… As the adaptable archivist… while her mind held… while outside the tower…" Paraphrase loops appear: "the door that shouldn't exist" (twice), "adaptable archivist" (three times within narrative voice), and synonym churn around "methodical" and "precision." The prose layers metaphor and elevated diction densely ("temporal architecture," "cartographic key to such impossible cartography," "foundational narratives") without relief, obscuring concrete action during the climax—we're told she "began reconfiguring" and "worked through the night" but see little specific verb work. Filter verbs ("found," "aware that") dull immediacy at closure. Information density is inconsistent; some sentences do double work, but scaffolding phrases like "the fables of absence had always suggested" restate theme without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere, but several paraphrase loops appear: "energy beings" described three times in the opening, "gently luminous" repeated for the stone, and "examining crack patterns in ice" stated twice in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with parallel "She [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. Figurative language is dense (trapped bees, ink in water, beaten copper, hammered repose) but mostly coherent; "bloom of hush" as spreading sphere works, though "null-song" and "hammered repose" edge toward mixed metaphor. Baseline scaffold penalty (−0.6) for paraphrase and template runs; no additional line-level opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"backward echoes like a net gathering smoke," "silence bloomed," "light unraveled outward in threads of gold"—sometimes layering metaphors in single sentences without clear vehicle coherence ("syntax, a language written in probability"). Paragraph 2 loops conceptually: the collapse was "shuttering," then "deliberate closing of doors," then "cosmic keys to unlock dormant potentials" without advancing new information. Stock metaphor "wearing a mask" appears in the final paragraph. Sentence openings vary, but the elevated register is consistent to the point of uniformity, reducing contrast in high-pressure beats. Clarity remains intact; the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages but several lines loop thematically without advancing situation: "preemptively nostalgic" appears twice, and the archivist-archive conceit is restated in multiple forms. The metaphor "stormlit clouds that churned beneath the tower like a silver sea" is clear, but "a wall of pearl" and "solidified fog" are repeated without evolution. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Grammar and tense are clean. The final paragraph summarizes the merge rather than enacting it through concrete image, which dulls propulsion at closure. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "belong to history and no longer to her private discovery" vs. "becoming the memory she had sought to preserve") cost momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence-level rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("fire spinner's kerosene rag knot, heavy with fuel, tucked inside his leather satchel like a beating heart"), but paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure, and "gravity of hopelessness" is restated three times. Stock metaphors ("heavy as mercury," "velvet darkness") and elevated diction that clashes with concrete action ("filtering upward through the fibers in blue and gold tendrils") create register drift in peak beats. No runs of identical stems, but the figurative density in the tower sequence (mosaic frequencies, heat spheres, sulfur dreams) without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers the overwriting check. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, stock metaphors in peak beats): baseline −0.6 in Q7; total deduction ~−0.8 for spread across closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences do double work (setting as metaphor, object as choice). Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. However, two adjacent sentences in paragraph nine paraphrase each other: "I spend my life in the margins" followed by extended explanation of margins is near-redundant (−0.2). Figurative language occasionally stacks: "between stone and pool, between solid and reflection" then immediately "margins...dying ecosystems...clock running out...texture" risks density without clear escalation (−0.3). The final "stars turned slowly, indifferent...yet somehow witness" is a stock construction. No loops touch closure, limiting deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, favoring long, layered sentences with embedded clauses that mirror the accumulative design. Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (advance action, layer metaphor, signal theme). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats ("the gilded hush flowed into the ceramic body, filling the hollow figurine with a density that made the painted smile seem heavy with wisdom") sometimes slows momentum rather than sharpening it. Paraphrase loops appear: "stretching contracted" recurs six times, "intangibly tangible" twice, "xenial" three times—effective as motif but occasionally reads as synonym churn when the context does not shift meaning. Template cadence: several sentences open with "She [verb]" or "Mara [verb]" in close succession (paragraphs 14, 17, 20). Stock metaphor: "claustrophobia coiled...like a snake" and "greedy, familiar hands" lean conventional. No grammar or punctuation errors; spatial choreography is clear. The final image ("a xenial trellis of the mind above the clouds of pain") lands as intended but edges toward over-explanation. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings in peak beats): baseline −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle beats stacks figurative language ("spectral ribbons," "barometric whispers," "drowning in velvet," "snowfall") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and register penalties. Paraphrase loops appear ("the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" recurs three times; "drifting prism terrace" appears six times with minimal variation). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" across consecutive lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("silence had learned its lesson"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains intact, preventing further deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid figurative language ("memories surfacing from deep water," "liquid crystal," "weight of ages"). Two paraphrase loops appear: "the ruby flake...pulsed" recurs without added pressure, and the final two paragraphs restate her return and archival mission in near-synonym terms ("composing the new entries" / "archive would live on"). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she [verb]" openers across the middle third, and the closure beat includes scaffold phrases ("understood now why," "treasures greater than") that tell rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from dense metaphor saturation in nearly every sentence ("tender shadow keeper," "encroachment upon the space he had fortified," "cartography of necessary violence," "crucible where suffocation transformed into respiration"), creating a lyric overlay that often obscures rather than sharpens the underlying actions. Paraphrase loops appear: "boundary between keeper and visitor becoming permeable" echoes "fading threshold dissolving further" without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "he rose… his fingers tracing… he said… she stepped… she said… he nodded" structures multiple beats identically. Stock phrasing ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper") recurs without reweighting. Information density is moderate, but clarity suffers under the figurative load, especially in the transmission beat where mechanics are told abstractly rather than shown through sensory or causal detail.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with runs of stacked metaphors in peak beats: "pressure vessel," "geological strata," "compressed carbon," "shadowseam wonder," "microscopic prisms" appear in rapid succession without space to breathe or anchor in concrete action. Template cadence emerges in the middle third—"The texts had warned her," "She understood now," "She was virtuously mischievous"—flattening rhythm. Paraphrase loops recur: "The bolt seals the hatch" / "It opens the floodgates" restates the same superposition twice; "pressure had not disappeared; it had simply changed its state" / "becoming something that reflected light" summarizes the same transformation. These artifacts cluster in the climactic transformation sequence, dulling immediacy. Information density is uneven: the opening anchors cleanly, but the middle third leans on conceptual restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting penalty: figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching—"sepia reading room exhaled dust motes," "evening stretched its first yawn," "golden banners masking iron fists," "particles collaborating to expose what ink could not safely record"—creating density without proportionate pressure gain (−0.6). Mixed metaphor: "each step erasing centuries" while "legitimacy crumbled like dry parchment" stacks incompatible vehicles (−0.3). Template cadence in the middle third: "The mechanism groaned, then sang... The physics of resonance... The suspended particles... Each oscillating mote..." (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "eloquently silent" appears three times across the text, twice in identical phrasing. Information density is high in the revelation beat, but momentum sags under ornamental layering elsewhere. Cumulative Q7 artifact penalty: −1.3, placing the score in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose demonstrates strong vocabulary and vivid imagery ("mercury fruit vibrating between liquid and solid states," "cold fire"), and sentence rhythm varies between long, clause-laden structures and occasional tighter beats. However, pervasive overwriting undermines momentum: nearly every sentence in the opening two-thirds carries multiple metaphoric or abstract qualifiers, creating density without propulsion ("his withdrawn nature calcified into something beyond mere silence, a complete retreat from the human sphere"). Template cadence appears in repeated "his [noun] [verb]" stems across the armor-removal sequence. The closure beat suffers from stacked abstractions—"ceased to be one thing and became everything, finally whole in his dissolution"—that dilute the image with redundant phrasing. Figurative language occasionally contradicts itself: "factually mystical" and "quantifiable magic" attempt paradox but read as forced oxymorons rather than earned tensions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or emotional progression. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with some strong images ("manila monuments," "fossilized into brittleness"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the "unknown histories" phrase recurs without always adding pressure; "tactfully hopeful" appears three times in similar contexts; and the closing two paragraphs restate the transformation concept through slightly varied metaphors (mausoleum→library, button→method, dust→map). Filter-verb density is moderate but acceptable ("she found," "she understood," "she realized"). The prose remains clear but could achieve greater compression in the final third where thematic synthesis becomes somewhat repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece suffers from repeated scaffold phrasing: "carefully resourceful" appears twice, "tyranny of indifference" three times, "coded freedom" twice, and "holding the line" twice, with minimal reweighting. The final paragraph loops thematically ("still the underestimated rebel, still the quiet man") and summarizes rather than propelling. Mixed metaphor in "the lagoon erupted in synchronized light" (eruption versus synchronization) and elevated diction ("auric," "defying the silence authoritarianism required") occasionally obscure clarity. No severe loops, but redundancy in the last third dilutes closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or abstract construction ("crafting a vested hush," "architecture of his defense," "ghost of melodies never born," "silence that could unmake their meaning without ever touching them"). Paraphrase loops appear: "not notes exactly, but the spaces around them" / "the music existed in the gaps" / "note by absent note" recycle the same concept across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the climax: "He could feel... He poured... He held..." Stack of filter constructions flattens immediacy. The closure image is clear, but line-level density and synonym churn measurably dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports visual flow. Information density is moderate—most lines advance setting or transformation imagery. However, several prose artifacts reduce clarity and momentum: "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is repeated verbatim three times (paraphrase loop); "tiny monuments to forgotten things" appears identically twice within close proximity; "transformed always" recurs as a scaffold phrase. The phrase "the hush where past meets prophecy" is poeticized but vague, and "galleries for wind" + "texture of bark that breathes" stack metaphors without clear physical grounding. Figurative density in the transformation sequence (final third) approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching. Apply −0.8 for loop/template artifacts and −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats, total −1.1.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sentence variety and high information density ("glass roof shattered into teeth," "water cutting through bedrock with geological patience"). Minor loop: "uncertainly certain" appears twice within close proximity without substantial reweighting between uses. Figurative density is high but occasionally tips into ornament ("darkness held substance and weight" followed immediately by "spray" and "veil" and "torrent's irregular pulse")—three metaphoric vehicles in rapid succession without clear necessity. No major artifacts touch closure, so the ceiling remains sub-8.0 territory rather than disqualifying high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.6)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance either Elara's process or thematic texture. Rhythm varies purposefully, and technical terminology (copper sulfate, phosphorescent, entropy of memory) reads plausible. However, the prose displays recurrent overwriting: "balanced alchemist whose equilibrium between mercury and salt," "factually mystical atmosphere where thermodynamics and theology merged," "the precise, unbreakable logic of her love." Several sentences loop conceptually—"magic operated on immutable principles" is restated as "accept that matter could neither be created nor destroyed"—and abstract phrasing in peak beats ("calculating the weight of names," "poetry," "sufficient love and accurate mathematics") dulls immediacy. The metaphor of light bending around a dense star feels strained in context. Minor template cadence appears in the night-work sequence: "She worked… She pushed… When dawn light filtered…"

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, overwriting clusters in the opening and middle: "the luminous ache of unfinished stories," "shimmering with the luminous ache," "her heart heavy with the luminous ache"—the phrase recurs without fresh meaning. Template cadence appears in the confession sequence: "The soul described how she had hidden… how she had died…" Figurative language is dense ("smoke," "peeling back the fabric of reality," "tapestry") without always advancing pressure. The final descent image is clean and propulsive, but earlier beats carry scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("stars of her own damage," "silverware of her suffering," "voltage she now generated herself") and occasionally muddles clarity with mixed or strained vehicles. Template cadence appears in chains: "She was... She could feel... She understood... She reached... She braced..." Paraphrase loops cluster around the mathematics-of-mercy conceit without adding new pressure. The final image is evocative but the line "her roots dangling with the silverware of her suffering" contradicts physical logic. Proofreading is clean; information density is moderate; momentum sags in the middle third due to synonym churn around trauma vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from figurative density and template cadence. Multiple sentences open with "Elara [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation. Phrases like "elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," and "between-worlds translator" recur as labels rather than evolving images. The unfastening sequence stacks metaphors (parting water, touching smoke, loosening knots) without clear propulsion, and the final paragraph loops through scaffold ("another overlooked history honored through the hidden details that only those who dwelt between worlds could perceive and unfasten"). Information density is moderate; many lines describe the mystical process without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the dust-pattern analysis and mainspring discovery. Some overwriting appears: "the amber hush of late afternoon light filtering through grime-coated windows" stacks modifiers without urgency, and "the weightless burden" recurs as a phrase rather than evolving its vehicle. The metaphor "dust spoke in gradients" is vivid but borders on precious. A paraphrase loop near the end—"keeping time for no one and everyone" and "keeping time for those who existed outside it"—cycles without added pressure. Clarity remains intact; no causality breaks. The final paragraph's rhythm supports the thematic close.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and imagery, but density issues appear: several beats restate the same concept with synonym variation rather than advancing pressure ("perfect systems of absolute stasis where nothing rustled, nothing woke, and eternity stretched in frozen silence" is followed by similar restatements). Figurative language is frequent and occasionally mixed ("when breath still carried weight and words possessed consequence" followed immediately by "vibrating with a frequency that matched the rustling"). The final third's cascade (crack → glass remembering sand → books opening → cloud-sea churning) is vivid but edges toward overwriting with stacked metaphors. Template cadence in the opening paragraphs (repeated "she [verb]" stems) adds −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is ambitious and often striking ("visible time pooled like amber wine," "sorrow polish their understanding like metal against velvet"), but figurative density is high throughout, creating occasional coherence strain ("burnished sorrow of his voice commanded silence"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He found... He explained... He demonstrated"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the ornate register in peak beats (council presentation, final paragraph) slows propulsion. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but others ornament without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("struck tuning fork that refused to fade," "flowers wilt before frost"). However, several beats edge into overwriting: "lovers in endless dance," "audible light," "breathing world above" stack metaphors without adding clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: the covenant of rust is explained twice in adjacent sentences (oxidation preserves truth; corroded metal sings when honest). Template cadence in the ritual sequence ("He placed…watching it glow," "He felt the tether catch," "He closed the lid") flattens propulsion. Moderate −0.6 for density and loop artifacts that dull momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and image-rich, but several beats loop conceptually: "hinged awakening" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs; "sensibly eccentric" is stated then illustrated; "impossible petrichor" is asserted multiple times without additional nuance. Template cadence appears in the second half: "She understood now...," "She wasn't here to...," "She would climb back..." stack similar syntactic frames. Figurative density is high throughout ("calcified lace," "velvet silence," "silver mist," "cathedral vaults") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking purple-prose register drift in a piece whose POV is ostensibly a working collector. Sentence-level propulsion is strong in the descent but slackens in the lagoon scene where reflection replaces forward motion. Information density is high, but paraphrase loops (e.g., compass couldn't measure / compass had waited for someone to understand) reduce efficiency. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn touching multiple beats, and −0.3 for figurative saturation without clear pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrase-pattern artifacts pervade: "timewoven alliances" (6×), "scaffold complexity with simplicity" (4×), "turbine-hum reverie" (4×), "perpetually learning" (3×), "layered meanings" (4×), "magic lantern slide" (6×). These recycled phrases create synonym-loop effect even when not exact duplicates, dulling momentum (−1.0 cumulative in Q7). Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" paragraph openings (−0.4). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase without adding pressure: "The slide projected phantom figures… shipwrights, weavers, and stonemasons whose hands moved in collaborative patterns" followed immediately by interpretation of those same patterns. Information density is low; many sentences do one job where two would fit. The opening and closing lines carry voice but middle beats drag with exposition. Clarity remains high; no grammar breaks or sequence errors.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "bell of suspended amber," "spectral roots and invisible stems," "sediment clearing from deep water," "shadows soft as velvet," "a second heartbeat." In the final paragraph, nearly every sentence carries metaphor, flattening propulsion. "Umbral tenderness" appears twice in close proximity (paragraphs four and seven). Paraphrase loop: "not to hide from the sun, but to be ready for its first ray" echoes "already yearning toward a dawn they could not yet see but trusted completely." Template cadence: "She was a vivid mural artist... She worked with... She understood at last..." Baseline −0.8 for density + loop + cadence, escalated to −1.0 because metaphor stacking touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("clouds that tasted of salt and static," "each stone a clause in the treaty with history") offers vivid moments. Clarity suffers from density without payoff: "retrocognitive trap," "encrypted diary," "acrostic verse," "maritime code," and "psychic tether" layer specialized terms in rapid succession, creating conceptual congestion. Paraphrase loops appear: "arranging beach debris as messages" → "each shell...a word in the negotiation, each stone a clause" restates the same idea across adjacent lines. The closing paragraph stacks abstractions—"communion," "sediment becoming stone," "secrets finally translated into the light"—that summarize rather than advance the final image. Template cadence: "Each time...," "Each shell...," "Each stone..." across three beats in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences in the opening and closure beats without pattern-teaching: "ash-gray tide," "naked architecture of cause and effect," "gestating the future within a shell," "singularity of organized potential that tasted of copper." Mixed metaphors collide (a "seed" that cannot "sprout" becomes a "crucible for transformation"). Template cadence appears in mid-story: "She did not merely recall...instead, she actively manipulated," "not to revive...but to architect." Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (paragraph five restates "reject false comfort" from paragraph four). Line-level artifacts in closure beats trigger extended penalties and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "velvet disquiet," "translucent question mark," "falling upward through the canopy while remaining perfectly still." Mixed metaphors appear ("the wax shaving vibrated with a frequency…settled in his sternum, humming with futures unchosen") where acoustic and somatic vehicles blur. Template cadence runs in the final third: "He walked…He would continue…He smiled." Paraphrase loop: paragraph 4 restates paragraph 3's discovery without added pressure. Combined artifacts trigger −1.0 in Q7, and presence in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("breath crystallizing in fractal patterns," "time itself seemed to exhale, stretching like taffy," "fierce quiet of growing things"). Several vehicles contradict or strain logic: "furiously tranquil" asserts emotional opposition without dramatizing simultaneous impulses; "decreasing entropy" by "pulling heat from the cold" reverses thermodynamic language in ways that feel decorative rather than rigorous. Paraphrase loops appear: the phrase "furiously tranquil" recurs three times without variation, and "borrowed time" is repeated across paragraphs with only synonym shifts ("texture of borrowed time," "touched the borrowed time directly"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("it felt like bark... like the slow pressure... like patience") that cycle through sensory comparisons without advancing knowledge. Information density suffers when lines restate the same content (e.g., "decreasing entropy" is explained, then re-explained, then summarized again in the kneeling beat).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but suffers from significant template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops. "After the glue dries" appears three times as a structural phrase without accumulating new meaning; "zero hour" recurs as a label rather than a charged motif; "credibly curious" and "humble" are stock modifiers applied without irony. Lines like "She pulled with steady force" and "The bell's voice rolled out" are functional but generic. Figurative density is moderate (cathedral bell rope "coiled like a sleeping serpent," cloud sea) without muddle, but information density is low—many sentences restate the bell-versus-siren contrast. No loops obscure causality, but momentum drags in the final third as the piece explains rather than dramatizes the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several adjacent sentences in the middle third restate the same content: "he learned to listen" / "He did not merely observe; he learned to empathize" constitutes a paraphrase loop (−0.2). Metaphor density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching; in the meteor-shower beat, stacked images ("raining silver," "refract the dying light," "geometry of decay") approach overwriting without clarity loss but dull immediacy (−0.3). "Flourishing stillness" appears three times, and "yellow lantern glass" is named in nearly every beat, some mentions purely descriptive rather than active. Template cadence is minimal, but the elevated diction in peak beats ("the universe whispered its oldest secret") edges toward stock profundity. Information density is strong overall; no major clarity breaks. The closure beat is clean, preventing deeper penalty, but cumulative line-level slips cap the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled, with varied sentence openings and lengths. Information density is high in descriptive passages but momentum stalls in mid-story summary ("The beekeepers had promised..."). Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every line in the middle third carries stacked metaphor ("weight that pulled at his ribs like a hooked line," "heavy as honey, bitter as smoke, accumulating like sediment," "transferring the burden of memory...thread by luminous thread"). Mixed or extended metaphors blur clarity ("tangled covenant," "hooked line," "suspended in amber light" without clear vehicle coherence). Synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "unspoken words suspended" / "unspoken words he had never possessed courage to read" / "everything never voiced." Template cadence: "He observed how...how...how..." runs across three clauses. Filter-verb stack in the observation passage. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (opening the box, ghost contact) triggers −0.7; template and loops add −0.6. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy and tighten pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances concept or character. However, overwriting clusters appear in high-pressure beats: "the space between lightning and thunder compressed into tactile experience" stacks metaphors without clarity gain, and the phrase "damaged time capsule that had called to her across the fractured decades" mixes temporal logic (fractured decades after numbers changed meaning). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions in the final third ("The capsule's steel casing," "The urn fragment," "The emerald silo," "The cremation urn"). Paraphrase loop: "Time did not pass; it accumulated" is restated as "the endless texture of the moment that would never end yet always begin anew." Apply −0.8 for clustered artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("sky still bruised with clouds," "like a banner of green flame") but the accumulation across most sentences creates texture that occasionally slows propulsion. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "the broken shells, the tangled kelp, the incomplete things" and similar triadic lists throughout. Minor paraphrase loop: "harmonizing discord" and its restatements ("allowing them to speak to one another," "acknowledged its fall, its imperfection") recur without escalation. The kite-string simile ("as a kite string snaps") is elegant but the story then literalizes it immediately, reducing the metaphor's independent charge. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is high; no loops or scaffold. Information density is uneven—many sentences restate the copper-wire mechanism without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He wrapped the conductive metal... The diary explained... He wrapped wire... The living stone began..." Figurative language ("patient hunger," "living starlight," "gospel of coexistence") clusters without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Rhythm is steady but rarely varies for urgency. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and carries vivid images ("copper patina gleaming wetly," "morning glories," "diffused spring light"), but suffers from overwriting in high-density figurative runs: nearly every sentence in the opening paragraph stacks metaphor ("bronze quiet," "fly amber," "biological timestamp," "closed system") without propulsive causal linkage, triggering the Density check (−0.5). Several paraphrase loops appear: "abandoned observatory" / "abandoned artist colony" and "questions and strange atmospheric residues" / "invisible radiation or viral agents" restate ideas without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions in the first two paragraphs. Cumulative artifacts total −0.8 in Q7. Information density is moderate; many sentences do descriptive work but few advance tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative language pervades nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels: "twilight like a hypothesis testing the water," "dormant explosion waiting for permission to detonate into green," "slow, inevitable siege of the battlefield, root by root, word by word." Paraphrase loops appear: the submerged concord is described twice (graf 7 and graf 13) in near-synonym terms. Template cadence: "He [verb]... The [noun] [verb]... Their voices formed... Speaking back..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Clarity suffers under metaphor stacking; information density is high but momentum drags. Apply −1.2 for pervasive figurative density, paraphrase loop, and template cadence in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts accumulate. "Intuitively descriptive" appears twice as template phrase without clear action function. Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—creating occasional opacity: "translating the scent of copper oxidation into memory, the groan of settling steel into weather reports only he could understand" works, but sustained across the entire piece the elevated register risks drowning concrete action. Paraphrase loop in the closure paragraph: "translate distance into closeness," "kilometers into centimeters, years into seconds, absence into presence, silence into song" recycles the same concept four times. Stock metaphor: "hollow space that ached to be filled." Minor pronoun ambiguity when "Other dogs had abandoned the hunt" after "the settlement sprawled"—momentary spatial confusion. These issues lower momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ending. Sentence openings vary; no major grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    High figurative density throughout: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated comparison ("seconds expanded into agonizing hours," "muscles and thoughts into taffy-like resistance," "stars stretched into smeared lines"). In peak beats (fixed-point glimpse, threshold crossing) the ornate diction competes with momentum rather than sharpening it. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate stretched movement without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" openers recur across five consecutive paragraphs mid-story. Clarity remains legible but density overruns propulsion in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bleeding aurora when the sky is wrong," "constellations had shifted into impossible geometries," "sacredly playful...reverence that danced rather than genuflected." Mixed metaphors (sky "cracked like porcelain" then "bled away") and template cadence runs ("He withdrew...This lid was...it marked him") accumulate. Paraphrase loops: "not merely stealing back history, but using the sacred method to amend it" restates the prior beat without added pressure. Scaffold density in final third ("no longer a thief but a keeper," "vast and unknown and open-armed") dulls closure. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for density, coherence, and loop issues; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is ambitious and controlled but struggles with density and figurative coherence. "Nomadic penumbra drifted... that permanent half-eclipse... a shadow that moved like a slow predator" stacks three metaphors for the same phenomenon in quick succession without adding pressure. Register is elevated throughout ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") without modulation for urgency, and several beats paraphrase: "half-false, half-true, walking the boundary between performance and authentic suffering" restates the same idea within one sentence. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's triple "how" construction. Clarity is maintained, but overwriting and synonym loops dull momentum, triggering cumulative deductions in the −1.0 to −1.4 range and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or concept. Figurative language is pervasive—nearly every sentence in the middle third carries a metaphor—but the vehicles remain coherent and contribute to the mercury-glass / language-as-geography conceit. However, several lines paraphrase: "They reached not with hands but with a quill" is immediately followed by "deciphering via the texture of a feather," restating the method. The phrase "hidden thunder" appears twice (opening and closure) without evolving meaning. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "home was not found but seeded, not remembered but written" reads as rhetorical balance rather than scene momentum. Minor scaffold and metaphor density in high-pressure beats lower the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("woven hush," "threads of silence," "sediment clearing," "heart with room to beat") and several images blur rather than sharpen ("winnowing absolution from wreckage" is abstract). Paraphrase loops appear: "the silence becoming almost tactile, a pressure" and "woven hush deepened" restate the same texture. Template cadence in the opening third: "He had been... Now he sought... The tapestry depicted... Each time he identified..." Stock metaphors (sediment clearing, heart/room) lower specificity. Artifacts touch non-closure beats; apply −0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. However, three paraphrase loops touch key beats: "forged hush" appears three times without reweighting, "pale spire in the mist" recurs without evolving meaning mid-story, and the final paragraph contains near-duplicate phrasing ("became exactly that: infinite variations" echoes the prior image without added pressure). Register occasionally elevates ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") in moments that warrant tighter embodiment. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "truth...refracted...into prismatic shards" and "seeds" work without contradiction. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the memory-sequence beats. However, several lines carry ornamental doubling: "hissing sea" echoes "green froth that hissed," and "uncertain alchemist" recurs as a label in both early and late paragraphs without fresh pressure. Figurative language is dense—"liquid light," "ash drifting like snow," "maps to survival"—and mostly coherent, though "quilting memories" and "suturing" mix craft metaphors within one paragraph. A paraphrase loop appears: "not drowning, but diving inward" near the opening is conceptually restated in the final dive. Template stems for "Here," whispered three times, serve ritual purpose but edge toward mechanical cadence. Syntax varies well across beats, and no major grammar or sequence errors appear.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and vivid imagery. However, several passages show overwriting: "intimately aloof from the tourist trails," "the weight of absolution," "geological time she had loved" stack metaphoric and abstract language in succession without always serving immediate pressure. A paraphrase loop appears ("the empty quay and the empty flat and the empty mornings" echoes "cracked mirror... truly gone" structurally). The closure beat is clear, but figurative density in non-peak moments (stalagmites/masts, algae/constellations) occasionally slows momentum. Template cadence appears in the opening two sentences (both use subordinate clauses delaying the main action). Applying −0.6 for density and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    High figurative density in peak beats: "screaming tenderness," "fever dream," "violence of his own quiet," "lullaby sung through clenched teeth"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen (screaming tenderness contradicts itself; violence of quiet is abstraction). Paraphrase loops: "vibrations of intent" and "purifying intentions" reappear without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening (comma-stacked descriptors) and final paragraph (stacked that-clauses). Stock phrases: "the world could breathe again," "drowning in noise." Deductions: figurative muddle −0.6, loops −0.4, stock phrasing −0.3, register drift −0.2 = cumulative −1.5 in Q7. Information density is high, but clarity suffers at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is lyric and dense, with vivid imagery ("skin grafted over titanium ribs," "moon was a rind," "verdigris matching the corrosion"). However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence creates textural drag without clear pattern payoff: "bell a wound opening in the dark," "lunar tide filling her cognitive cracks with silver light," "archipelago of absences." Some metaphors feel strained or mixed (hydraulics as circulatory system for an engine that runs on memory). Paraphrase loops appear: "geography of loss" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in passages like "She understood now... She was building... She soldered..." creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is high but momentum sags under ornamental layering. Strong specific nouns and verbs, but the overwriting in peak beats (final third) triggers penalty and disallows 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and ritual beats. No loops or synonym churn. However, several lines carry overwriting that slows momentum: "the ancient orchard that clung to the cliffs like a desperate prayer," "the antique glass eye stared up from the root ball, its iris painted with spiraling gold that caught the gray light—a smuggled relic from the Closed Century, when minds had been private fortresses" stacks metaphor and exposition. The closure paragraph summarizes future action rather than staying in the present image, diluting propulsion. Figurative density in the final third ("fractured grace," "fortress of silence," "seed of psychological safety, fragile and fractured") feels layered for effect rather than emerged from scene pressure, triggering a −0.3 to −0.5 deduction for overwriting in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character knowledge, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("lichen on stone," "pearls, layer upon layer") is coherent and image-driven. However, template cadence appears in several lines: "She found... She clutched... She moved... She saw... She understood... She raised... She would remain." This syntactic pattern spans multiple beats and dulls immediacy during the investigation sequence, triggering a −0.6 deduction for template-cadence run. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high in setting and object description, but multiple lines paraphrase stakes without adding pressure: paragraph 9 ("the doorway of decisions required temporal pressure") rewrites paragraph 10 ("doorway of decisions required temporal pressure as much as it required the key") with synonym churn. Paragraph 12 summarizes closure theme that paragraph 15 will restate. Stock metaphor "sunrise through stained glass" in the final beat. Template cadence in paragraph 4 ("He had noticed," "his gut—trained by...—told him") and paragraph 14 ("why Thomas had given," "why he had to be," "why the promise had to linger"). Filter-verb stack ("watching," "feeling," "recalling") across paragraphs 7–9 dulls peak discovery beats. Elevated register ("empirically intuitive," "crucible of consequence") clashes with scene urgency. Combined artifacts and loops trigger penalties per Q7 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "cobwebs of silver dread," "lacy menace of mineral deposits threading through the rock like veins in an elderly hand poised to strangle," "the peculiar scent of ending things." Mixed metaphors (the grotto "breathing warmth" while also pulsing with "lacy menace") muddle clarity. Sentence stems repeat ("The dreams were," "The ember grotto was," "The water mirrored"). The closing paragraph runs three compound-complex sentences that stack dependent clauses without breathing room, and key turns are told rather than enacted: "the mystery unraveled itself, threads of dream logic weaving into waking understanding" summarizes rather than dramatizes the realization. Deductions: overwriting density (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence (−0.4), total −1.2 routed here.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is pervasive and often layered without functional pressure: "the ember nexus pulsed with directed spontaneity, each flicker of coal and cinder following chaotic yet purposeful paths" stacks three abstractions in sequence. The piece exhibits paraphrase loops—"capture the density of presence" / "the impossible weight of being truly seen" / "the gravity of now" recirculate the same concept across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in expository interiority: "This was [X]" recurs four times. Sentence openings show limited variety in high-pressure beats; six consecutive paragraphs in the ritual sequence open with subject-verb structures. The Text Artifact Screen triggers deductions for synonym churn around "presence," "weight," "density" without meaningfully advancing stakes, and the closure paragraph's "heavier than gold and lighter than breath" contradicts the established physics metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is purposeful and varied; figurative language ("hot air balloon lifting," "threads crossing and knotting") supports the lyric accumulative design. However, several phrases loop conceptually—"feral nostalgia" appears thrice, "chronologically confused" twice, "jaded wonder" twice—and the ascent passage stacks abstraction ("shimmering constellation," "defied simple logic of calendars") without concrete propulsion. Minor template cadence in the scroll-writing beats ("he wrote of X, of Y, of Z") and synonym churn around "fragmentation/chaos" reduce density. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors and controlled pacing. However, template cadence appears in repeated stems and near-synonym loops: "reading between the lines" occurs three times, "through occluded views" twice, "trembling calm" four times, "humanize" three times. These recurrences feel decorative rather than charged by reweighting. Figurative density is high throughout ("watercolor washes," "spectral," "silver comma suspended in amniotic fluid") without always advancing pressure, risking overwriting in a reflective mode. The paraphrase loop around "emotional terrain" (clients' terrain, her own terrain mapped in condensation) and scaffold phrasing ("she had been," "now she," "she would") slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory anchors (ozone, burning lungs, silver dust). Information density is high in ritual beats. However, phrase recycling weakens momentum: "crow quillrimmed tip" appears in full five times, "saturated hush" three times, "budding rune scholar" twice, "crystallized when stressed" / "scars crystallized when stressed" / "crystallizes when stressed" across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "breath between storms" is reworded as "passage between the retreating storm and the approaching gale," "breath still held—suspended in the breath between storms," creating a paraphrase loop. Template cadence: "She [verb]…she [verb]…she [verb]" structures dominate action paragraphs. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull line-level impact and disqualify 9+ across categories per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the ritual sequence (terminals connected, bottle vibrating, spirit materializing). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "the imperfect miracle began to unfold" followed by "The composer's form materialized" restates the same content. Template cadence appears in the closure third: "The apology delivered, the circuit broke. / The perfume bottle shattered, its purpose spent, and the composer's spirit dissipated..." pairs summary declaratives without added pressure. Filter verbs ("looked at her with eyes," "carried the weight") dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat. No artifacts touch the closure image itself, but the stack lowers momentum slightly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose exhibits high figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff: most sentences in the opening paragraphs stack metaphors ("universe had paused, caught in a hiccup," "definitions crumbled into luminous dust," "semantic stubbornness") that elevate register but slow propulsion. Template cadence appears in parallel structures across adjacent paragraphs ("She moved wanderingly exact," "The method required journeying inward," "She was arbitrating between memory and void"). Paraphrase loops recur: "journeying inward while walking out" is restated three times without added pressure. The phrase "wanderingly exact" is repeated in five separate beats as a descriptive crutch. Stock metaphors—"linguistic fossils," "cooling embers of the last stars," "pages being turned by an unseen hand"—reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines perform conceptual work but few advance plot or character choice. Clarity remains legible, preventing deeper penalty, but momentum is sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies effectively and figurative language ("razor edges," "frozen second," "lantern against the dark") serves the concept. However, several beats engage in paraphrase loops: the passage from "Twenty-one..." through "...never seen light" restates the same insight (clocks measure resistance/the present/the boundary) across multiple numbered beats without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the countdown structure itself, though this reads as purposeful rather than artifactual. Clarity remains high but density could be tighter in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer image, theme, and character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chance was not merely chaos but a lucid contradiction" is restated in multiple forms across the piece. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" constructions and parallel "to widen perspectives," "to traverse the random" infinitive phrases. Figurative language is dense ("clover melancholy," "mineral window that fractured light") but occasionally stacks without breathing room. The final paragraph compresses multiple closures ("teach differently," "necessary, lucid grace," "carrying the contradictions") in a way that dilutes each beat's distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with purposeful sentence variation and sensory density that serve the lyric mood. Information is efficiently layered: the disc's crack, the streetlamp handoff, the booth's acoustics all do multiple jobs. However, repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops accumulate: "melodically haunted" recurs as a label; "cultivated estrangement" and "teach endings how to begin" are restated across paragraphs without added texture; multiple sentences open with "Mara" + verb or "The disc" + verb, creating template cadence in the second half. The closing paragraph summarizes the thematic architecture already demonstrated ("endings were simply beginnings wearing masks") rather than trusting the image, and stacks abstract metaphors ("garden where nothing needed to die") that dilute propulsion. These artifacts touch the final third, lowering momentum and violating the Q7 9+ disallow trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and image-rich, with high information load per sentence and purposeful metaphor (flowers as paper lanterns, grief altering salinity). Rhythm varies, and the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gently thorough" is restated three times across the piece without new pressure; "the covenant" and "proximate causes" recur as conceptual labels rather than evolving images; and the final paragraph summarizes the closure beat rather than letting the image speak. Minor filter-verb clusters ("felt the haunted euphoria rising," "felt it in the shift") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (ivy as "green fingers," isolation as "freight") is generally purposeful. Information density is high in the opening third. However, scaffold phrases recur: "Elias had spent," "He believed," "But reciprocity demanded," and the final paragraph loops thematic summary across multiple near-identical stems ("not because of," "where the rules," "cataloging not"). Template cadence in reflection beats and paraphrase loops in the closing section trigger −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and clarity remains intact at closure, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in most sentences: "constellations paused their eternal shifting," "moss that sang of ancient patience," "geometries of grief." While some images are striking, the accumulation borders on overwriting, particularly in peak beats where embodied action would sharpen pressure. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "languages... dialects" and "uncharted emotional depths... unmapped countries" recycle the same concept. Sentence openings vary adequately and rhythm supports the lyric mode, but information density suffers when metaphor does multiple jobs simultaneously. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, keeping damage contained.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("time folded like origami," "pretzel logic," "light pooled like mercury," "frost in sunlight"), creating density that occasionally obscures propulsion. Paraphrase loops are present: "confidently uncertain" appears three times in similar phrasing; "planting the wrong seeds" recurs without evolving function; "strange comfort" is repeated identically. Template cadence runs ("She was... She needed... She touched...") cluster in the opening third. Several lines restate the same content adjacent to each other (e.g., the pen "had never written on paper, but here... it could scratch revisions" is then echoed by "began to drink the light instead of ink, rewriting the transmission"). Information density is moderate—many sentences layer metaphor without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (bioluminescence, liquid silver, tapestry of negative space) is purposeful and vivid. Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or thematic charge. Two artifact clusters lower the score: paraphrase loops in the middle third (e.g., "mapping silence into geometry, translating the negative spaces into staves and measures" immediately followed by "This was his motivation...to translate silence into music") and template cadence in the conducting sequence ("He moved...Mara followed...He raised...He turned"). The final line is clean and resonant.Proofread quality is strong; no grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    Density is high, but the prose suffers from template-cadence runs ("she had been," "she understood," "she would create," "she worked") and elevated diction that clashes with the immediacy of peak action: "volcanic tenderness" and "ferocious care" appear multiple times without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase loops cluster around the promise/covenant/treaty theme, restating the same idea across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphors—"volcanic tenderness," "smoke…clung to meaning like incense"—muddle physical logic. The −0.6 to −1.4 baseline applies; artifacts touch the closure beat ("a promise kept"), so the penalty escalates and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm generally varies and information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (world-building while advancing Kael's attempt). The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, mild overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "quantum threads," "quantum foam," "harmonic mist," "starlight and sorrow" stack elevated vehicles in rapid succession without always landing with precision. The phrase "the entangled ghost that the treatment had preserved" and "the space between them" edge toward abstraction during a peak beat. Minor paraphrase loop: "the golden water lifted into the form of a woman" is closely followed by "She was not Elena, not exactly, but she was the Elena that existed in the space between them"—the second sentence restates the first's essential information without adding causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high (storm→static→maps, footstep identification, zodiac mechanics). "Calculated spontaneity" and "recognition" replace locks elegantly. Minor scaffold: "the unspoken challenge between them" abstracts what the prior beat already dramatized. One paraphrase loop: "whispers made physical" restates the shift-toolbox/safety-cone code without added pressure. "Starlight and memory" is stock but lands with purposeful echo. No figurative muddle, grammar clean, propulsion strong. The opening and closing lines frame stakes and reconfigure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.7)
    High figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff in peak beats: "cobalt vapors," "liquid glass," "obsidian surface," "constellations," "tapestry of silver" cluster without adding causal pressure. Paraphrase loops present: paragraphs 5–6 restate "reflection not penetration" and "silent empathy" without advancing knowledge or stakes. Template cadence: "The guardian [verb]" appears in six paragraphs, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors ("stars," "void," "darkness as student") lack character-specific inflection. Clarity remains intact; deductions route here per the Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often beautiful ("cobalt library...stones the color of deep ocean held captive in architecture"), but appears in nearly every sentence, including high-pressure beats, without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure—triggering the Overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops are present: "unspoken words...trembling frequencies of thoughts people swallowed" and "unheard sentences" restate the same concept across adjacent lines (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the litany structure ("the father's unvoiced fear...the librarian's silent grief...the children's wordless panic"), which recurs without tension or variation (−0.4). The final third sustains ornate metaphor ("amplified quiet within him like a lantern that needed no flame") that clouds propulsion. Cumulative artifact penalty and density issues lower the score; no loops or scaffold clutter touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for two distinct issues: density + template cadence).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("liquid silver," "spectral shimmer"). However, the prose carries significant overwriting: nearly every sentence in the transformation sequence deploys figurative language without breathing room ("fortress," "weapon against brutality," "marrow of the scrimshaw," "barometric pressure of her soul"). Stock metaphor strings cluster in peak beats ("guarded heart" appears four times; "combative tenderness" twice). The template cadence of "She [verb]... the [noun]... her [noun]" recurs across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops are present: paragraph two restates the guarded-heart fortress concept across multiple lines without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion and information density: "turbines cast shadows that moved like second hands" anchors setting, time, and motif in one image. Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer reflective beats). Minor pattern: "He was whittling" / "he announced" / "he intoned" / "he sought" recycles "he [verb]" stems across four beats, creating mild template cadence (−0.3). The "remade hush" definition is elegant but interrupts momentum slightly (−0.2). No loops or figurative muddle at closure. Sentence-level clarity is high; propulsion supports accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "tremor of certainty" → "conviction so profound it manifested as physical vibration"; "dissolving boundaries" recurs five times without added meaning. Template cadence dominates peak beats: "She was aesthetically driven…," "The method demanded…," "The pillars sang louder…" Figurative density in most sentences ("lantern-moth hush," "cobalt tint… a substance she could wade through," "shadow multiply… in fractal patterns") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.8). Stock metaphor strings ("bridge between," "silence between syllables") replace concrete action. Closure beat is heavily artifacted, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift, but template cadence appears in mid-story beats: "She wanted… She had heard… She arranged… She placed…" clusters four consecutive "She [verb]" stems without pattern payoff, triggering a −0.5 deduction. Figurative language is dense—"phoenix-feather ferns," "glass-berries," "cinder-vine," "foxglove"—but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops. The phrase "imperfect" recurs six times, bordering on churn but serving thematic cohesion. Minor scaffold like "Elara understood" appears once without flattening closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is grammatically clean and spatially coherent, but suffers from repetitive stem patterns ("she walks," "she approaches," "she raises," "she strikes") and synonym churn around "powerfully gentle" (appears three times with minimal recontextualization). Several sentences loop thematically without adding pressure: the manual's assumptions are questioned twice in adjacent beats, and the closure paragraph restates the fractured-crystal metaphor that was already demonstrated. The final lines stack declarations ("She has discovered," "she knows she will not leave") that summarize rather than propel, dulling the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "curtains of intention hung between the visible and the remembered, translucent veils that shifted" and "genuinely artificial memorials—permanent records of impermanent grief, authentic precisely in their deliberate falseness" load figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("curtains" as barriers that "parted" yet also "veils that shifted"). Paraphrase loops occur: the concept of "genuinely artificial" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in the repeated "She [verb]..." stems. Information density is low in expository blocks; many sentences restate the same conceptual claim. Patterned-artifact penalty applies: −1.0 for density, coherence, and loops combined.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do double duty (setting + tone, action + theme). However, several phrases loop or restate: "rain-beaded skylight" appears three times, "steadily curious" twice without adding pressure, and "multiplying paths" recurs as summary rather than fresh detail. The figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally dense without payoff: "metastasized into collective delusion" and "neural network drawn in obsidian ink" pile metaphor without clarifying cost. The final paragraph's cadence shift works well, but earlier beats carry mild template phrasing ("her fingers tracing," "leaned closer, his breath fogging").

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "atoms of nostalgia," "violence and grace," "joy sharp as a knife," "grief bright as dawn." In the climax, nearly every sentence carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating cumulative opacity (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: "atoms…like dust motes…like golden fireflies" shifts vehicle mid-beat (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: "She had…," "She was…," "She left…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: the penultimate and final paragraphs restate the historian's lesson about chaos without added detail (−0.2). Total artifact penalty: −1.5. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("the particular anguished joy," "steadily unpredictable") recur without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and vivid with controlled rhythm; phrases like "violet twilight bled through the library's glass walls" and "petals opening to release stored starlight" are concrete and purposeful. However, "softly deliberate" recurs as a template stem across three paragraphs ("softly deliberate ritual," "worked softly deliberately," "shadow moved...softly deliberately"), creating a low-grade loop that dulls momentum. Minor register drift: "metamorphosis of hope itself, transforming from belief into mourning" edges into abstract philosophizing mid-scene. Information density is strong, and the narrative propels through Elara's cross-referencing without significant scaffold, but the repeated cadence and a few over-written figurative moments ("blooming library's floral shelves closing around her like protective hands") slightly obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports visual pacing. Figurative language is generally coherent (layers/skin metaphor sustained), but density is uneven: several adjacent sentences restate the same reflective content without adding pressure—e.g., the second and third paragraphs loop over complicity, blindness, and self-deception with slight synonym variation. Template cadence appears in the fourth paragraph: "Marcus was gone, arrested, and she remained…the animals who were real, the injuries that needed mending, and her own fractured integrity…" reads list-like. The fifth paragraph's object-removal sequence (gloves, apron, pendant) is clean and purposeful. Minor filter-verb stacking ("felt the echo," "felt like stripping") in reflective beats dulls immediacy. The closing image is strong and concrete. Clarity is maintained throughout, but paraphrase loops and moderate figurative density in non-closure beats trigger modest line-level debt. No text-generation artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("fossilized into scar tissue," "atoms aligned," "chlorophyll and slow time"), but several images are mixed or strained: coffee rings cannot "spell coordinates" without a mechanism, and "ghost-prints left by his sister's fingers on the hourglass glass before the frost had formed inside it" is syntactically tangled. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions and scaffold connectors ("then," "now"). The penultimate paragraph summarizes key realizations ("the surgeries had mapped this path") rather than dramatizing them. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but information density sags when metaphor piles without propulsion, especially in the cavern sequence where four consecutive sentences assert understanding without embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or thematic layering. However, several beats lean toward overwriting: "hushed thunder" recurs three times as a label without fresh embodiment, and metaphoric density in peak moments (theater as body, film strip as neural pathway, love as warehouse) stacks without clear dramatization. Paraphrase loops appear: "The film strip coiled…like a question mark" and "The film strip snapped taut" repeat the object-focus without advancing pressure. The phrase "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" recurs as a rhythmic motif but remains ornamental, never constraining choice. Clarity remains intact, so artifact penalties stay within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "unspoken words" appears three times, "moonstruck dreamer" twice, "shadowed rapture" twice; "stardust" recurs across many lines without functional reweighting until the end. Template cadence in the middle section ("She moved...," "She charted...," "She lay down...") flattens propulsion. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—and some vehicles clash (eardrums pressed by words, cage made of block, stardust flowing like water). Apply −0.6 for loops and cadence, −0.4 for mixed metaphors at non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    High figurative density throughout: "bark peeling from dead cedar," "cold fire," "bulbs waiting for seasons," "quantum prayer." Many sentences do double duty (character + world + theme), but the relentless lyricism creates a plateau rhythm rather than modulating with pressure—the archive arrival does not shift cadence. Paraphrase loops: "stripped of shadows"/"void filled with purpose," "glowing dune"/"phosphorescent lichen" reiterate across paragraphs. Template stems: "He worked," "He had carried," "He moved," "He spoke," "He understood" cluster in the opening half. No hard scaffold or typos, but the ornate register flattens propulsion. Information density is high; clarity holds despite metaphoric load.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with strong specificity: "canopy of copper leaves," "mercury rivers," "cathedral of glass branches." Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, several beats loop conceptually: the "wild frontier" is described as both "retreated violently" and "a boundary to push outward" without progression between mentions, and the insight about the sixth sense is articulated twice (once to the stranger, once at the nexus) in near-identical phrasing. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "knew") cluster in reflective beats, dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is often vivid ("bioluminescence painted the rocks," "mist clung to her ankles"). However, the piece carries pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the journey sequence deploys figurative language ("tide pools and archways of driftwood that logic said should not exist," "shadows pooled like ink," "compass spins wild"), creating density that occasionally obscures propulsion. Several adjacent sentences loop conceptually: the leash/restraint/permission idea is articulated multiple times across the middle and ending. Template cadence appears in the "gently persistent" and "indirect routes" phrases, which recur as labels. The final paragraph's "one deliberate step after another into the waiting light" closes on metaphor rather than concrete image, diluting closure clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Significant overwriting appears in the final third: "seraphically mundane existence," "sanctified hush," "frostbitten hope warming his chest" stack elevated metaphors in adjacent beats without clear payoff, and the phrase "choosing silence now as a gift of patience rather than a cage of fear, waiting for the spring" edges into abstraction during the closure moment. Paraphrase loops appear ("the unpardonable silence" / "that collective vow never to utter a word"). Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades: "the weight of epochs bowed his shoulders with regally unpretentious dignity" stacks modifiers; "the inevitable separation of water from oil, truth from fabrication" is a mixed metaphor (separation is neither water-from-oil nor truth-from-fabrication in concrete terms). Template cadence runs appear ("He had wandered... He had waited... he had spent millennia...") and multiple sentences open with "The" across paragraphs without variation. Stock metaphors abound ("turning pages in an empty room," "falling leaves," "dust fine as pollen"). Purple prose ("the pause of shifting constellations," "the great clock completing its cosmic cycle") elevates diction past POV plausibility and obscures concrete action. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. The closure beat—"humility was the only crown he had ever sought to wear, and that he carried invisibly within his ancient heart"—is an abstract assertion rather than a concrete image, dulling the final moment. Paraphrase loops (the pretender's disguise "sloughed away" / "peeled back" / "split completely") recycle the same event.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, memory, or revelation. Minor paraphrase loop: "periodically eternal" appears in two adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). The "fossil fuel ban" framing and "delayed revelation" phrasing echo prompt language but remain dramatized rather than summarized. No figurative muddle; metaphors (coral cathedrals, silent collective gasp) are coherent. Proofreading is clean; pronoun references unambiguous. One scaffold phrase ("the atlas page had come from...") slightly dulls momentum mid-paragraph but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "She + verb" or "The + noun" across adjacent lines, creating mild monotony. Stock metaphor "knife's edge of possibility" and minor paraphrase loops (hum/vibration/resonance recur without added nuance). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "thunderous serenity" and "bleeding hour" work, though "margin of daylight" is repeated without reweighting. No major loops or scaffolding obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several artifacts dull momentum. Paraphrase loop: "She had come here to unseal the future, not merely rebuild the past" and "Tradition had always been about preservation, about keeping the embryo sealed forever in protective stasis" restate without added pressure. Register drift in peak beats: "the mathematical precision of the kite's code and the biological permission of the plant collective" intrudes with academic diction. Template cadence: "The elders called it sacrilege… Mira called it evolution with intent" and "not a command but a potential" repeat parallel structures mechanically. Minimal filter-verb stacking; grammar is clean. Apply −0.8 for loop and register drift touching closure area.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor paraphrase loop appears: "He did not fight the freeze" is closely restated by "he observed it as he would a rare bird, noting how his muscles locked." Template cadence in one passage: "He had arrived... He did not need... His hands would freeze... Through these bodily warnings..." uses similar constructions across four sentences. Figurative language (pearl, oyster, calcification) clusters in the middle third but serves a taught pattern that pays off. The final paragraph maintains propulsion through the photograph moment to the evening watering without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but coherent. Two paraphrase loops: "What is a portrait if not…" / "What is a lighthouse if not…" back-to-back reads as template cadence (−0.4). The "walls close in" phrase appears three times without reweighting. Metaphor strings ("finger pointing at the dark," "cartographer of broken things") approach overwriting in the closure paragraph. No clarity breaks, but the artifact cluster in the final third disallows 9+ globally and nudges the score below 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense and often contradictory: "shadows bleed back into light," "fractals that breathe and shift," "playing him like a flute made of time." The final third stacks metaphors without anchoring them in physical sensation, blurring the closure image. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately, but the overwriting in the dissolution sequence ("becomes distributed through the moment," "vibrating with the frequency of someone") sacrifices clarity for lyricism. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("The tracker watches… the tracker begins to disappear… the tracker reaches out").

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting throughout: "dizzying quiet" appears four times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent paragraphs, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high in emotional beats ("contraband truths," "fever of revelation," "electric potential," "digital ghosts") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence in paragraph four ("accessing… awakening… coughing") stacks participles mechanically (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "truth flow liquid and burning through the streets" conflates incompatible vehicles (−0.3). Information density is solid in action sequences, but scaffold phrasing ("the bravely conflicted archivist," "the dangerous liaison letter") recurs as labels rather than earned reference. Cumulative artifact penalties reach −1.2; closure beat ("waited peacefully") is touched by tellingness, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterning. Sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (ballast origin, tower collapse, father's profession, surgical memory) without padding. Two minor frictions: "senselessly perceptive" and "tranquil blaze" appear multiple times in slightly decorative iterations, trending toward label loops. The phrase "engraved quiet" recurs without evolving mechanically, costing momentum. Otherwise clarity is strong, metaphors cohere (shed skin, spiderweb cracks, folded hands), and the final image propels without scaffolding. No grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information layering and vivid images. However, metaphor vehicles occasionally shift without grounding: the spike "transliterates" anxiety into weight, then etchings, then topography, then braille within a narrow span, creating mild conceptual muddle. Several paraphrase loops appear ("transliterate" recurs six times in similar constructions; "patterns break themselves" restated). Template cadence and elevated register ("oscillating reeds," "phonemes that tasted like") slightly dull propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("sound bounced between brass telescopes like accusations," "lantern" dawn), but several metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "orbits of regret" appears four times with slight variations that blur into paraphrase. Template cadence in paragraph four: "The orbits of regret were not celestial but moral... The orbits of regret continued their eternal paths" loops the concept. "Solemn playfulness" is asserted twice without embodied texture. Sentence openings vary, but information density sags in expository beats where abstraction replaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and ambitious but overwritten in peak beats. "Dissonant chord that had screamed beneath her ribs for two decades without finding resolution," "temporal breach," "spectral tendrils," "collapsing the wave function of regret" stack metaphoric and scientific diction without breathing room. Template cadence appears: "The amber provided the material anchor; her guilt provided the desperate energy." Paraphrase loop: "The meteor hush deepened, time pressing…" shortly after "that terrible meteor hush where sound seemed vacuumed…" Figurative density obscures rather than sharpens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The unease deepened as the color spread" directly restates the prior sentence's mood. Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff—"mist coiled," "architecture of doubt," "geometry of forgotten names," "bruised, feverish lilac"—creating decorative density that slows rather than propels. Template cadence in the opening beats ("Mara stepped," "She was," "She knelt") and filter-verb stacks ("realized," "understood," "watched") dull immediacy. Metaphor coherence is strained: "whispering gallery tile flake" is geologically implausible and "an ear cupped to receive sound" rendered in sand contradicts prior parabolic geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (blue birds, wound/womb) charges key images without clutter. Minor scaffold appears in near-paraphrase adjacencies ("The shattered sky seemed to listen" follows conceptually from prior lines). Template cadence is avoided and information density is high. A few abstract constructions ("catastrophe's mathematics," "context of survival") dilute propulsion in mid-beats, though the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "shoulders curled like sheet music left in rain" conveys posture, despair, and music motif). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—synesthetic imagery, the Wheel of Fortune, the fractured timeline—though it risks overwriting in several stretches ("violet resonance of forgotten arias," "turquoise harmonies and deep indigo vibrations"). Sentence openings vary and syntax supports the lyric accumulation. Clarity issues: "temporal density" and "fractured timeline shuddered" are abstract conveniences; "echoes...existed outside linear time" tells mechanism rather than grounding it in concrete action. Minor template cadence in the middle paragraphs ("Julian understood," "Julian moved," "Julian felt") and slight paraphrase loop between "echoes grew louder" and "accumulated weight of every standing ovation."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer setting, method, and theme without stalling. Rhythm varies across the piece, moving from short urgent beats ("She began to move") to longer reflective arcs in the final paragraphs. However, the prose carries overwriting in peak moments: "fractally precise patterns," "silicate sheets shimmer with an internal logic," "willowglass hope crystallizing" stack metaphoric vehicles in adjacent lines without clear payoff. Two paraphrase loops appear: lines 9–10 restate the geode's resonance mechanism, and the final two paragraphs repeat the sanctuary/connection realization. Filter verbs ("She held," "She closed," "She touched") cluster in the search sequence but remain voice-motivated. No major template cadence or scaffolding, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high; no ambiguous references or tense breaks. However, multiple sentences open with template structures: "The caves were factually mystical," "The fossil grew warm," "The song emerged," "They were becoming." Paraphrase loops appear: "to become the voice of the unknown" (paragraph 5) restated as "becoming what they had always intended: not just a surveyor...but the voice of the unknown" (paragraph 14) and "The voice of the unknown had finally found its words" (final line). Figurative density ("ghosts in the damp air," "rock itself dreamed," "memory refusing to dissolve") accumulates without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, reading as ornamental rather than propulsive. Deduction baseline −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence across key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    High figurative density pervades every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "fossilized time pooled in golden strata," "hourglass turner," "canyon echo," "narrative threads encoded in ivory, brass, and wood" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Template-cadence runs appear ("She worked…," "She was quietly inspired…," "She had succeeded…") and paraphrase loops recur ("shared wisdom of the buttons" appears three times with minor variation). The Text Artifact Screen triggers penalties: synonym churn (truth unravels × 2, shared wisdom × 3), elevated register drift (unearthed silence, raw possibility), and stock metaphor strings (amber dust, shimmering motes) reduce propulsion and clarity. Final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate; no grammar errors. However, figurative language saturates without clear pattern payoff: "gauze," "silver hush," "skeletal pines," "the earth tilt toward spring," "the water was cold, but it was moving." Register drifts—"vouchsafe," "disavowal," "prudently daring"—clash with the present-tense urgency of a burned spy. Minor paraphrase loop: "codes...codes spoke of...codes she had left" across three beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to absorb," "felt") appear but are voice-tolerable. Overwriting in the final third ("mended soul," "current to be entered") dulls the closure image with abstraction. Apply −0.6 for density + register drift in peak beats; −0.2 for paraphrase; total −0.8 non-closure, baseline ~6.9 → 6.1.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but occasionally overwritten: "spindrift serenity," "gloom-hill," and "palimpsest promise" appear multiple times within a short span, creating metaphor-stacking without always advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops are present: "reducing knots to lines, reducing fear to breath, reducing waiting to presence" and the fog/percolation sequence repeat the same concept across adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in the middle third (multiple "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems). Clarity remains high, but information density suffers from synonym churn ("distill," "essence," "simplified," "reducing") and the closure beat is slightly muffled by elevated diction ("crystalline permission").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with strong imagery ("chimney smoke flattens against the bruised dawn sky") and selective detail. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character perception, or thematic resonance. However, some phrasing risks overwriting: "a question that had settled in her chest" is stock interiority, and "the careful economy of a potter who knows that clay remembers every touch" is figuratively dense without clear dramatized payoff. The final paragraph recycles "sharp gentleness" and "phototropic to kindness" as thematic summary rather than pure image, creating minor scaffold. No loops or template cadence runs, and the "thrumming" motif recurs with functional variation. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high. However, patterned phrase recurrence becomes intrusive: "wistfully pragmatic" appears twice, "quivering hush" twice, "rhythm of oars in water" three times (once as "the rhythm of oars in water, that ancient cadence"), "pull and release" four times. The final paragraph contains two near-identical constructions describing vigilance and care. Mixed metaphor in "instilling the harbor with a vigilance"—one instills values in people, not locations. Figurative language is dense in reflective passages without pattern-teaching or clear payoff. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range in Q7 per the prose-artifact guidance, with concentration in non-closure beats preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("frozen lightning," "cloud-tides," "equations of time in photons") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff; several metaphors compete for attention in single beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "She was not the last companion...she was the first librarian" and "isolation was merely the raw material...independence was forged" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("The humming intensified...the hum settled...the hum reached its crescendo") and filter-verb reliance ("she realized," "she saw," "she felt") dull immediacy. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags under ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "spiral chambers of her chest," "phantom weight of pens," "inevitably whimsical." Two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: the nest is described as "tight at the center, expanding outward" in both paragraph two and the installation description in paragraph four; "prismatic quiet" appears three times without evolving function. The phrase "the keeper of secrets became the thread that connects all things" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo, restating rather than imaging the shift. Otherwise, sentences carry multiple jobs and propulsion is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or character. However, template cadence appears in repetitive paragraph openings: "The astronomical charts..." appears three times as a stem. Synonym churn is visible with "charts" (astronomical charts, charts, the charts) and "subsonic" (subsonic generator, subsonic frequencies, subsonic hum, subsonic thrum) across adjacent beats without functional variation. "Cautiously hopeful" appears twice identically as a phrase, the second occurrence adding no new pressure. The climactic beat is clear and propulsive, protecting the score from deeper penalties, but these artifacts accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the organ-music and gear-strike sequences. Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "forcing her to wait" / "telling her to wait"; "walls pressing against her shoulders, her ribs, her screaming mind" is effective but "screaming mind" edges toward stock intensity. Figurative density is heavy throughout ("breathing depths," "jealous hearts," "skeletal shadows," "chewing at the air itself"), and mixed vehicles occasionally muddle (hearts attempting to crush into paste; gears chewing air with mechanical hunger). The clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting appears in clusters: "memory refusing to dissipate," "the persistent fog that clung to the limestone walls like memory," and "abscess of silence that had protected the powerful" stack metaphors without clear advancement. Several template cadences: "she removed," "she descended," "she set up," "she let," "she worked." The phrase "years had passed since the masquerade ball when the heiress vanished into this geological wound, and now, long after the evidence disappears from police vaults and witness memories decayed into static" mixes tenses awkwardly (past perfect → present → past). Filter-verb runs ("she understood that to solve this," "she could not visualize") in reflective passages dull immediacy. The closure image is clean but the path to it carries moderate line-level drag.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece suffers from scaffold redundancy: the concept of "reversible exile" is explained three times with paraphrase variation, and the stanzas-as-coordinates revelation is summarized twice in adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("hammering in her chest," "the wind shifted again, carrying the smell of old storms") appear in peak beats without transformation. The opening sentence runs 45+ words with nested clauses that obscure rather than propel. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("some coffins... some reputations... some maps") creates rhythmic artificiality. Apply −1.2 for loops and stock phrasing; the artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure, so cap at this band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several beats demonstrate high information density and purposeful compression. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence recur: "He had always believed…after the screams…after the audience" repeats syntactic stems; "dynamically observant" appears twice as descriptor; "pixelated amnesty" is restated in near-synonym across multiple beats without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in every high-pressure sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting that dulls momentum rather than sharpening it. The closure beat itself is relatively clean, capping non-closure deductions at −0.8 per the accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specific detail ("thousand-rupee note," "velvet curtain"). However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "dusky harmony that felt like acceptance," "perceptively, finally, calm" stack modifiers without added precision. Paraphrase loop: "He was not hiding...but studying" immediately followed by near-restatement in "mapping regret" and "geometry of repetition." Template cadence: "His father took by force; Elias had taken through..." runs across multiple parallel constructions. Filter-verb stack in the final third ("he had been fleeing," "he now inhabited," "he understood") dulls immediacy. These artifacts touch closure, triggering disqualification from 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence harm momentum. "She wrote of the merchant… she wrote of the widow… she wrote of her brother's final fever dream" is a three-beat parallelism that recounts rather than dramatizes. The opening sentence stacks modifiers ("the chilled dome of the celestial mapping observatory") and the piece repeatedly uses "had" past-perfect constructions that create distance. Stock metaphors appear: "understanding dawned with the sudden clarity of a variable star reaching its maximum luminosity" is a predictable image. Register drifts into elevated abstraction in peak beats ("the constellation of grief," "the infinite") without earning the leap through concrete action. Information density is uneven—long sentences that do multiple jobs alternate with summary that adds texture but not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("green tornado of roots and rot," "expanding circles across black water"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries metaphor or elevated diction without pattern-teaching or clear payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("flesh-eating plant seed...warm and hungry," "spiral unwinding"). Template cadence is visible in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" stems. Paraphrase loops occur: "warlike serenity" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Figurative density in the vortex sequence obscures immediate causality (−0.5 in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Density is high but clarity suffers: "premature chronology," "sympathetic resonance," "intersection of dreams" layer abstraction without grounding. Paraphrase loops appear: "anxious elation" recurs verbatim; "cobalt" modifies grass and canopy without variance. Figurative language is dense in every beat—"shadows pooled like ink," "roots...singing in harmony," "voice crackling like dry leaves"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty. Template cadence in opening: "The future had arrived early, shattering the eclipsed covenant that was meant to bind time itself for another millennium, leaving the world gasping..." is a nested clause stack. No artifacts touch closure directly but spread reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "bartered destinies were not so easily cheated" advances plot, characterization, and theme simultaneously). The prose is largely free of loops and scaffolding. Two issues prevent higher scoring: (1) Metaphor density in the first half occasionally muddles rather than clarifies—"fiercely gentle" appears three times, "trammel" used both literally and metaphorically within close proximity, and the stacked abstractions ("grammar of grief," "economics of souls," "mathematics of a heart") risk coherence strain. (2) Template cadence in the orchard-observation sequence: "he saw a future... a warning... a benediction" reads mechanically parallel. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, so caps are minimal, but they prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative density throughout ("wind's whistle through the valley like feedback from a dying amplifier," "value calcified memory into commodity") that coheres with music/sound motifs. Information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Deduction: several runs of similar syntactic patterns and some near-paraphrase loops ("After the applause" recurs formulaically; "confidently uncertain" repeated without fresh pressure). The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("dissolving into the long, gray frequency") to slight muddle. Proofreading clean; no major artifacts, but density and echo create minor momentum drag in the last third.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancies: "touching distance" appears twice with nearly identical framing; the translation-as-transformation concept is restated across paragraphs 9, 10, 17, and 20 without advancing pressure. Template cadence in several paragraphs ("He had returned... operating"; "Elias understood... Elias smiled... Elias recognized"). Elevated diction throughout ("haunted ambitions," "stubborn persistence of meaning," "radical conversion") creates uniform textural density that doesn't modulate with scene pressure. Several sentences perform double exposition without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third. The piece avoids paraphrase loops and maintains clarity. However, several lines lean toward overwriting: "shimmering like heat waves," "luminescent fog that smelled of cedar and old rain," "pale gold light filtering through the glass dome" cluster figurative language densely without pattern-teaching (−0.4). Metaphor coherence holds, but the final paragraph's "like salt left behind by evaporating water, or like amber holding ancient motion" stacks similes where one would suffice. No scaffold or template cadence appears. Propulsion remains steady but does not accelerate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "faceted walls that trapped ancient light within their lattice, a latent radiance waiting for the right vibration to release it from crystalline prison" stacks metaphor without propulsion. Paraphrase loop in final paragraph: "dissolving the final barrier" / "walls between hearts crumbled" restates the same content. Template cadence: "She swept… She lifted… She understood… She held… She climbed" across adjacent paragraphs flattens rhythm. Mixed metaphor: pearl as "door for living" contradicts its spherical enclosure. Density is high but momentum sags under figurative load. Final deduction: −0.9 for combined loops, template stems, and density without earned payoff in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors clustering in nearly every sentence ("rivers remember everything," "anesthesia of prescriptions," "course through the debris of her own making"). While many are vivid and voice-consistent, the accumulation risks overwriting, especially in high-pressure beats where plainer syntax might sharpen impact. The paraphrase loop "She would go... She would stand... she would let" in the penultimate paragraph restates the same intention three times without added detail. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the accumulative design, but the density prevents 8+ eligibility. No major clarity breaks, but propulsion occasionally softens under metaphorical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "coagulated into walls of living luminescence," "floorboards of compressed starlight," "membrane of living script that pulsed with the attribute of being cyclically reversed." Figurative density obscures rather than propels, especially at the closure beat ("ancient dust, then as fresh vapor, then as crystalline structure"). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 4 and 5 both describe the library's recursive architecture without added pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" constructions. Clarity suffers under ornamental load, and the closure image is dulled by abstract metaphor rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with strong imagery. Multiple overwriting issues accumulate: density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("spectral veins," "vegetable kingdom screamed," "puncture wound in the fabric of what would be," "specific gravity of ice transforming to water"), mixed metaphors (coffee stains as "dark continents bleeding" then "puncture wounds"), and elevated diction ("mycorrhizal networks," "lignin," "cambium and sap") that occasionally clashes with immediacy. Several paraphrase loops: the violin's melting is described multiple times in adjacent passages without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The oak roots drank greedily... By morning, the violin would be gone... Every tree would bear witness..." stacks similar syntactic structures. Applying −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for loops touching the closure region.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density ("cathedral of quartz and silence," "electromagnetic whispers of memory and dream"). No loops or scaffold. Minor density issue: "the dancer's final moments—a pirouette, a mother's face, the scent of rain on warm stone" lists memory fragments rather than dramatizing their capture; summary-only use of a key beat. Figurative language is controlled (aurora as "jade and violet silk," chip as "green net") with no mixed metaphors. One stock phrase: "forever standing watch" is serviceable but not fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong figurative control in places ("vineyard hush," "scalloped bed") and maintains clear spatial choreography. However, density issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("forgiveness had not brought peace, only the hollow duty" / "the source of contentment lay not in preservation"), synonym churn around "scalloped" (appears 5+ times with minimal functional variation), and template cadence in the final third ("Elias understood now," "He would continue," "But now his duty felt"). The opening sentence runs 32 words with nested clauses that bury the anchor. Stock metaphors ("river of becoming," "wheel of becoming") and elevated diction throughout create textural richness but occasionally stall momentum. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose carries strong figurative texture ("coat snapping like a flag of truce," "cloak of doubt unravel into mist") with purposeful rhythm shifts. However, density slips in the middle third: "His hands trembled with protected vulnerability—strong enough to hold others' fractures, yet acknowledging his own" is a paraphrase loop, restating the same idea without added pressure. The phrase "sincerely insincere" recurs three times as a label without fresh embodiment. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("granite," "mist," "gold and gray horizon") without fresh vehicle work. Filter-verb stack ("saw through it," "saw how") in the descent paragraph lowers immediacy. No major artifact touches the final image, limiting penalty spread.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often evocative, but overwriting appears in most sentences of key beats without variation: "membrane between air and water, between knowing and unknowing," "gravity of what he had been and the levity of what he would become." Paraphrase loops recur (ripples/rings/circles/oscillating described repeatedly across adjacent paragraphs). Template cadence: "he had spent," "he was teaching," "he would vanish" creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is high, yet momentum stalls under decorative phrasing. The tense slip and filter-verb stacks in the trance sequence further dull propulsion at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and meditative, fitting the subject. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (arrowhead as compass, dust as witness). However, pervasive issues lower the score significantly: paraphrase loops abound ("centuries of layered dust" appears three times; "pulse left wandering" recurs without reweighting; "historically reverent" is repeated), synonym churn (towers of bone, bone towers; endless echoes, canyon of endless echoes), and template cadence ("through the patterns," "through centuries," "through the strata"). Stock metaphors cluster: "weathered resolve hardening like sediment," "ripples across a pond." Filter-verb stacks appear in several beats ("he understood," "he watched," "he had learned"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating overwriting. These artifacts touch multiple beats and dull momentum. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts (loops, cadence, stock metaphor strings) and an additional −0.3 for filter stacks, totaling −1.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high ("frozen accusation," "memory refusing to fade," "bones") but mostly coherent; "brilliant dimness" reads as purposeful oxymoron rather than muddle. Sentence openings vary. Information density is solid; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Two paraphrase loops: "imperfect and alive" closely echoes "irregular rhythm" in the same beat; "accommodates impossibilities" recurs four times, some instances restating rather than adding pressure. Template cadence in one paragraph: "The spire accommodated… Elias drifted… He reached…" across three sentences. Apply −0.6 for loops and template run. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("reef of rust and secrets," "slow-motion meteors in reverse," "drown in the dark") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff proportional to frequency; this triggers overwriting penalty −0.5. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 8–9 restate "hidden in plain sight" and "factual yet concealing" across adjacent beats (−0.2). Sentence openings vary and momentum is present, but the stacked metaphors in peak beats (tuning fork, violet shimmer, final epiphany) blur rather than sharpen the closure image. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance concept or action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "understanding static bursts" is restated across multiple paragraphs ("static bursts were not interference," "Understanding static bursts meant recognizing"), creating template cadence (−0.6). The backwards prophecy mechanism is explained multiple times in adjacent passages without added pressure. Opening and closing images are strong, but the middle third recycles phrasing around distillation and alignment without propulsion, lowering momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each creature solidified, becoming a monument to specific sorrows" advances action, names the beasts, and deepens theme). Rhythm varies appropriately, and sentence openings are diverse. However, filter-verb stacks appear in the climax ("watching the illumination dance," "feeling the distant intimacy") where immediacy would benefit from direct sensory rendering. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs four and five both describe scattered light refracting without advancing pressure between them. One metaphor muddle: "leviathan of her laughter" mixes threat (sea-monster) with joy (laughter) without reconciling the contradiction on the page. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—each beat advances reconstruction or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "lukewarm" recurs four times, "dripping rates" three times, and "brittle devotion" twice in adjacent passages without added pressure. Template cadence in "She had come... she had barely mastered... she must coax" (repeated "she" stems) and stock metaphor "willpower thinner than spider silk" dull immediacy. These artifacts don't obscure causality but flatten peak moments, triggering baseline deductions in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle paragraphs (photograph trail, label discovery). However, overwriting clusters in the opening: "the heartbeat of water against stone and the whisper of sediment settling" and "stone foundations emerged like broken teeth through the retreating silt, and the main street resembled a scar healing in reverse" stack metaphors without pattern-teaching. "Viscous mud that had been Mrs. Callahan's prize-winning vegetable garden" delivers specificity and irony efficiently. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the first third without payoff triggers −0.4. Grammar and syntax are clean; no pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "ink dropped in water," "mask of poetry," "lantern that would guide her," "algebra of her existence." Mixed metaphors appear ("geometry of transformation" as both spiral and choreography; "flame that burned away the boundary" yet also "settled into her chest"). Template cadence runs through the final third: "She understood now that... She stood amid... She smiled at..." Stock metaphor strings ("bruised purple sky," "autumn leaves," "quicksilver") and therapy-speak interiority ("integration," "dual nature," "perfect balance") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally. Paraphrase loops recur: "the philosopher's stone was not a substance to be isolated but a state to be achieved" is restated three times across the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance pressure or world detail (micro-fracture, muscle memory, thermal detection). Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during revision ("Her hands moved, not waiting for conscious confirmation"), longer cadence at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor ding: "soundless echo" recurs four times with slight redundancy; the phrase "the burden of the watcher was not in the watching itself, but in the knowing" slightly over-explains. A few filter verbs ("she could see," "she had spotted") are acceptable but not strictly necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("hollow bell," "sharp particularity," "hollow reed") and occasionally stacks metaphors in adjacent lines without clear payoff ("vessel that breathed without wanting" followed by "world fractured and reformed"). Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come… she could no longer recall… the jar arrived… it settled… Immediately, the custody battle began…" applies a similar stem rhythm across multiple beats. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak moments. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—obsidian walls, stalactites of grief, silence macerated into pulp—without pattern-teaching or payoff variation; the metaphor vehicle (maceration) is repeated mechanically across beats. Template cadence: "He pulled. Instead of... Each rotation... Through this liquefied..." creates drumbeat rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "macerate" and its cognates appear eight times, often restating the same concept without added pressure. Register drift into technical/poetic diction ("macerate," "liquefied atmosphere") clashes with the POV's established leaf-blower-conductor idiom. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("boundaries of light—where illumination ended and shadow began its true reign," "foggy lucidity—every droplet a clear thought suspended in ambiguous air"). Clarity is mostly maintained, but several lines loop conceptually: "interiorizing exteriors" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "the boundaries of light" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She was learning to make friends with uncertainty…She had made friends with uncertainty at last") that restate arrival rather than advancing it. The final third sustains the ornate register without propulsive sentence work, and some metaphors ("the mist thickened into foggy lucidity") blur rather than sharpen the image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (atmosphere + interiority), but scaffold phrasing ("Through the veil of sleep, she understood…") dulls immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong imagery (frost warm with retained fire, spectral rainbows through facets) and purposeful detail. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "to interrupt a stifling destiny" repeats conceptually across paragraphs one, four, and five without added pressure. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "the exact temperature...the precise pressure...the specific duration" and later "too high...the spirit...one final." Several stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "calcified into regret," "pennies dropping," "dangerous weight of possibility." The final paragraph especially leans on abstract summary rather than concrete image, dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong specific nouns ("meteoric iron," "crystalline lattice," "transmission spire"). Information density is high in world-building passages. However, several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "serenely electric" used identically in paragraphs three and five, "hollywood star fragment" repeated without variation across beats, and the phrase "The hollywood star fragment warmed in her hands" in paragraph three is echoed by "The hollywood star fragment began to sing" in paragraph five. Template cadence in paragraph two: "She had always approached…treating cosmic mysteries…" and "But this fragment defied…resisting all attempts…" follow parallel stems. Figurative language is dense in peak beats without payoff ("carving meaning into pure silence," "seed in winter soil") but remains legible. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence touching closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "empty hourglass" appears seven times with synonym churn ("not there," "absent sand," "ordinary dust"). Template cadence runs: "He [verb]" opens five consecutive actions in the middle section. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh particularity: "reality unspooled like loose rope," "memory floated like sediment," "starlight knitting into bridges." Filter-verb stack in the grotto's opening ("watched," "glimpsed," "understood") dulls immediacy. The closure beat—"forever ferrying passengers…across the delicate membrane"—deploys abstract metaphor rather than concrete image, reducing propulsion at the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("sinew thread... from whales that had drowned in the collective unconsciousness"), but the metaphoric register is relentless, appearing in nearly every sentence without modulation by scene pressure. Several phrases loop conceptually: "rational enchantment" recurs four times, "realistically imaginary" three times, "unsettling calm" twice, functioning as thematic anchors but also as synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" openings. Information density is high, but clarity occasionally suffers under stacked metaphors ("tensile membrane where both states could coexist without collapsing").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("broken their world open like a geode," "maze of recursive angles," "submarine tomb," "cocoon...prison"). Some vehicles contradict: geodes reveal static crystal, not dynamic dimensional expansion. Sentence openings show template cadence in the middle section: "The aliens had...They had simply...To navigate...The unfolded horizons..." Paraphrase loops appear: "The surface world was dead, scoured by tidal forces" is restated as "the chaos above" and "their refuge from the chaos above" within two paragraphs. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere without propelling conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("twilight bled," "radioactive with consequence," "bird-bone fragile," "desperate gravity"), and several vehicles clash or over-reach without pattern-teaching (e.g., "trapped moth" for pulses, "bridge spanning four decades"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She was a contact tracer… she was here to protect… She was tracking…" Paraphrase loops occur ("the pulses grew stronger, thumping" / "the faint pulses… grew in stereo"). The closing beat ("that was heroism enough") tells rather than charges the image. Proofreading is clean; syntax varies adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "Atlantic swallow the sun," "concrete barnacle," "crashing hush of absolute pressure," "eyes pools of static." In the central chamber beat, nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile, creating slight overwriting that competes for attention. A paraphrase loop appears: "drowned in signal rather than seawater" and "drowning in signal" restate the same concept. Sentence openings vary well, rhythm modulates with pressure, and information density is generally strong, but the metaphor load in peak moments slightly obscures propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction without breathing room ("stubborn lungs continued their defiant rhythm against the pronouncement of her erasure"). The opening 64-word sentence, while rhythmically controlled, delays clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "the digital ghost of her former self—the fragmented consciousness backup" restates without added pressure. Information density is high, but figurative saturation in high-pressure beats (defragmentation sequence, integration) dulls propulsion. Clarity remains legible; no causality breaks, but momentum drags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Density is high and propulsion generally strong, but several lines loop conceptually: "the death of the language accelerated with each passing breath" restates the offstage elder's decline without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The gem was rumored... Now it pulsed... The tunnel opened... Here, the attribute..." (four consecutive summary-declarative stems). Figurative language (trapped lightning, throat-like passage, organ pipes) is vivid but clusters densely in the final third without always serving clarity. Syntax varies purposefully elsewhere, and information density is solid. Minor scaffold reduces momentum slightly but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dense figurative language pervades high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "frostbitten fingers and eyes that remembered starlight," "cold stone burning against her ribs," "bones becoming lighter than regret." Mixed metaphors appear ("the barrier between observer and observed would dissolve into static and understanding"—static dissolves barriers?). Template cadence runs through the final paragraph with "she had... she was... she danced" stems (−0.5). Paraphrase loops occur: "metamorphosing" is stated three times across adjacent paragraphs. Register drift into cosmic abstraction ("gods," "entropy," "void between worlds") exceeds POV lexicon (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of peak beats without pattern-teaching: "iron logic that had strangled the valley's heartbeat," "roots writhing like awakened serpents," "bridge singing beneath her feet." Multiple lines restate the same idea with synonym churn: "enforce efficiency/mechanical perfection/clockwork fruit/production schedules." Template cadence runs in the climax: "She was signaling... She was not merely... She had not destroyed..." Stock metaphors ("precipice of irrevocable change," "geometry dissolve") lack fresh vehicle logic. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 repeat "statues paused/movements sluggish/hands falling" without added pressure. Applying −1.2 cumulative for density + loops + template stems touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high in the action sequence (paragraphs 8–11), though earlier paragraphs stack metaphor without always advancing plot: "vaulted ceiling absorbing the day's final echoes into a brittle hush that settled between the marble pillars like dust" is vivid but dense. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the opening and closing beats without clear pattern-teaching (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor clarity issue: "smuggling network of automated eyes" conflates the drones' function (surveillance) with Marek's counter-use (smuggling letters through their blind spots). Propulsion is strong in the middle, though the final two paragraphs recapitulate rather than compress.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid imagery: "velvet rot," "sequins like dried scales," "whispering gleam." Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure breathes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "quietly persistent nature" is repeated, and adjacent lines restate ideas without added pressure (e.g., "silence had never been his prison but his workshop" / "emptiness held infinite potential"). Template cadence is detectable in the final paragraphs ("He turned to leave… He held the halo fragment up… He walked toward the horizon"). Filter-verb stacks ("He realized," "He understood," "knowing he would return") cluster in the closure beat, applying −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("comet's tail of physical memory," "cutting through the digital age's haze") without pattern-teaching or payoff; many metaphors are ornamental rather than propulsive. Template cadence is pervasive: "She [verb], [noun phrase]; She [verb], [noun phrase]…" runs across multiple paragraphs without taught pattern. Paraphrase loops appear: "the place where stories lived" / "where stories truly lived" / "where stories pulsed" restate the same concept. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (character + setting) but several beats summarize rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("a creature of negative space, defined by what surrounded it") without pattern-teaching or payoff escalation, triggering the Overwriting Check deduction. Paraphrase loops appear: "luminous absence" recurs across five beats without evolving meaning, and "the hush of improbable beginnings" bookends without adding pressure. Template cadence is mild but present ("she had to," "she understood," "she needed"). Information density is low—many sentences elaborate metaphor without advancing situation or choice. Rhythm varies, but clarity suffers under stacked modifiers ("the precise, dangerous alchemy of sunrise photography"). The Text Artifact Screen flags scaffold ("the dream appeared...tentative and flickering, drawn by...") and conceptual redundancy in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies across the piece, and figurative language ("pinprick in velvet," "compass needle seeking north through time") delivers texture. However, density dips in the middle where "the fear tried to anchor itself" and "whispers of panic echoed" rely on stock metaphor without fresh embodiment. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: three sentences open with "The" (light, poet, nexus) in close succession. No paraphrase loops, but the closure beat's final sentence stacks three dependent clauses that dilute propulsion when a sharper cut would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports the accumulative texture, though some sentences lean toward dense embedding ("That was when her sister Lila had stepped into the fairy ring mushroom formation blooming in the central grow-bed and emerged speaking only in the dialect..."). The phrase "chronically curious" appears twice in close proximity (paragraphs 1 and 3), a minor loop. "Habits break" and "habit of taking" echo without adding pressure. Figurative language is dense in the opening ("cathedral of decay," "votive offerings," "salt songs") but purposeful. The closure beat is clear, though "their purpose fulfilled" tilts slightly toward scaffold summary. Information density is high; clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high (shard-mirror archivist, reversible exile, tea-leaf geometry all introduced efficiently). Minor template cadence in the three-week summary: "She taught through opposition... then soothing... When the day came" reads slightly scaffolded. No paraphrase loops; figurative language (afternoon shadow, angles of abandonment, steep cliffs of loneliness) works without muddle. The final lines propel cleanly without overwriting. Sentence variety supports rhythm across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries figurative language or elevated modifier stacks ("verdant parapet," "radiant hush," "liquid crystal," "oil-slick rainbows"). Template cadence appears in repeated "Upon the hush" framing and "insatiably creative" label. Paraphrase loops: "weaving between worlds" is restated three times without added detail. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing closure, and stock metaphors ("cathedral of preserved wonder") replace concrete image. Deductions: overwriting density −0.7, template cadence −0.5, paraphrase loops −0.4, final-paragraph summary −0.5 = baseline ~4.9.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("silence...grew heavy enough to crush breath from lungs," "starlight...bending into colors that had no names"), creating a lush texture that sometimes crowds the syntax. Several phrases loop conceptually: "accumulated silence" appears multiple times, and "interlaced hush" is restated without new pressure. The opening sentence is syntactically dense ("worked...needle poised...sanctuary...fracturing...geometries...danced...mask") but legible. Momentum occasionally stalls under ornamental weight ("the awareness that everything was precisely where it should be, yet nothing felt safe"), though the ritual progression provides propulsion. No major template cadence or paraphrase loops, but the density near peak beats (final knot, final image) risks obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Sentence openings shift; figurative language ("jagged canyon," "perfume that energized") sharpens moments without overwhelming. No loops or scaffolding clutter. Minor deductions: "the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" (final phrase is conceptually redundant), and a few abstract nominalizations under pressure ("the validity of empty spaces," "integrity of wonder") slightly dull immediacy. The penultimate paragraph's stacked abstractions ("absence itself became prayer and quietude became communion") risk purple haze but remain legible. Overall momentum is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively; sentence lengths breathe with the dive's pacing. Strong imagery: "snow globe's eternal winter," "dawn staining the horizon with... amber that reminded him of old paper and dying light." Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Weakness: mild overwriting in the opening third with stacked metaphors ("elegiac library," "waterlogged cathedral," "black box rendered as poetry") that approach density without clear escalation. The phrase "surface tension and memory" borders on abstract prettiness. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The final image is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("vapor," "suspended breath of time," "fractal patterns," "luminous dust," "tinkersong wonder fading into a single sustained note"). Template cadence appears in repeated "The ghost [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" stems across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "between lightning and thunder" appears three times without new information; "driftingly alert" is used twice identically. Register drift into lyric abstraction ("compressed time itself," "harmonics the ghost offered") clashes with the concrete object-work. Clarity suffers in the climax; the mechanism by which graffiti "completes the encoding" and the ghost "learns to encode itself into the physical world" is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (physical ascent tracks psychological revelation). Rhythm varies effectively between longer architectural sentences and tighter action beats. Minor loop: "warmly inquisitive nature" in paragraph seven echoes the opening's implied quality without adding pressure; the concept is restated rather than advanced. Figurative language ("mechanical flower blooming in illuminated code," "geography of hope") is vivid but occasionally clusters without tactical function. No major artifacts touch closure. Propulsion remains clear through the ten-floor structure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is mostly high, but momentum is repeatedly stalled by reflective loops and paraphrase. "The spooled wholeness of her previous life—wound tight…had finally unspooled into something vast and terrifying and complete" is immediately echoed by "she realized then that her motivation had never been about returning…they transform into atmosphere, into weather, into the very air." Template cadence and synonym churn ("empty spaces remember," "void remembers," "negative space that held the shape") recur across the text. Figurative density is high throughout (metaphor in nearly every sentence) without pattern-teaching or payoff, diluting immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in Q7; additionally, the abstract diction and stacked modifiers ("quietly explosive grief," "velvet dark") push the piece toward overwriting without grounding in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance multiple dimensions. However, several minor loops and near-paraphrases appear: "she had built her reputation painting portraits that captured souls rather than likenesses" restates the prior claim about her condition; "not turning back to watch the tree fall, for she carried the sky within her now" slightly restates the prophetic completion already shown. Figurative language is dense ("ribosomes inside a cell," "prophetic mirror suspended in pigment," "fractally precise") and occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats. The final paragraph stacks elevated constructions without clear propulsion ("eternal in the limits of her art"). No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative texture density in the middle third costs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specificity in some images (starlings "painted the twilight in shifting charcoal waves"). However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "made the silence bearable without requiring the pretense of human company or the exhausting performance of social grace" is a paraphrase loop, restating the same idea. "Diligently curious" and "secret patterns...invisible to the casual observer or untrained eye" are near-synonyms within a single sentence. The final paragraph stacks three appositional clauses ("no longer merely a vessel of solitude but a bridge to revelation") that summarize rather than dramatize the transformation. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She knelt...She began...She worked..." across consecutive paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and precision. Deduction: −0.8 for paraphrase loops, template stems, and summary-over-scene at closure; −0.3 for register drift in "social grace" and "species divide."

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythm and strong opening/closing lines. However, figurative language clusters densely in the hall-of-mirrors beat ("mercury caught in invisible currents," "liquid silk," "luminous threads") without cumulative payoff, verging on decorative. Minor loops: "hauntingly bright glow" and "hauntingly bright liquid" restate without added detail. "Driftwood nostalgia" recurs three times but only the final use reweights meaning. The phrase "ancient stones that had waited generations" and "three generations of waiting" near each other feel like synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the mirror-assembly sequence: "The mirrors shuddered… The gear assortment levitated… Elara watched…" No major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops blur momentum: "The timeframe of after strangers become family had settled into her bones like the chill of the alien soil, permanent yet strange" restates the prior sentence's "kinship" transformation. "The ghost wasn't haunting them out of loneliness; he was trying to orchestrate collective effort" tells what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence appears in the opening: "What began... had slowly transformed... though Mara still struggled..." Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "iridescent chalk that shimmered like dying stars," "brambled hope," "nebula of respite." The phrase "messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn" is repeated verbatim, creating a loop. Aggregated artifact presence in non-closure beats totals roughly −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or elevated abstraction ("nested patterns of infinite complexity," "gossamer chains," "hungry void," "bruised awe"). Many images are beautiful but adjacency creates muddle—"nested patterns" and "gossamer chains" and "quantum strings" all describe causality without differentiating. Paraphrase loops appear: "the mechanism groaned" / "the doomsday clock's hands trembled" both signal the same moment. Template cadence in the middle third: "She had vouchsafed…" / "She was vouchsafing…" / "She had spent lifetimes preparing." Register drift into philosophical abstraction ("mathematics of entropy," "poetry of decay") clashes with embodied action beats. Artifacts in the closure third trigger the 9+ disqualification and cap high-band entries at 8.8 globally. Deduction: −1.2 for density and loop artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in the middle beats: "She had three hours... Clutching the small nut... She understood now... She moved..." clusters four "She [verb]" sentence openings across six lines, flattening momentum (−0.5). The phrase "graceless beauty" recurs purposefully, but "offhandedly exact" is used twice identically without reweighting (−0.2 for minor loop). Figurative language is restrained and functional. Clarity is solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful scientific imagery woven through perception. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately (longer contemplative lines, shorter action beats). However, several figurative constructions stack in single paragraphs without escalating pressure: paragraph three layers "surface tension," "foam patterns," "symphonically," "bubble cluster a note," "larger composition" in quick succession, creating density without advancing causality. The phrase "symphonically minded by nature and training" in paragraph six is tell-heavy exposition after the quality has been demonstrated. Minor template cadence: "meaning X, meaning Y, meaning Z" structure appears twice ("I hear it now" paragraph). The final paragraph's "stretched without breaking...stored energy...released it as movement, as music, as forgiveness" approaches purple in its symbolic stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    Heavy figurative density in almost every sentence ("clouds swirled...in patterns," "books that grew," "amber time," "heat distortion," "negative portrait," "incised the air") without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, applying −0.6 for density. Mixed metaphors appear ("glass orchard library," "negative portrait of human absence," "nursery of narrative") without physical coherence. Paraphrase loops are present: "mindfully scattered" appears twice, and the final two paragraphs restate her departure in overlapping terms. Template cadence: "She had not come to sell… She had come to find…" and "Three point seven seconds… Forty-two centimeters…" without dramatized linkage. Deductions total approximately −1.2 to −1.4 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("scattered mindfully" recurs in the final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence openings vary and figurative density is high but purposeful, reinforcing the alchemical-transformation frame. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sturdy brittle" echoes in both physical (fortress walls) and metaphorical (emotional state) registers without added pressure; "sandpaper rough memories" and "sandpaper these edges" repeat the motif across paragraphs with minimal progression. Filter-verb stacks ("she tasted," "she was cooking," "she had come") cluster in the pavilion beat, dulling immediacy. Stock metaphor strings—"breathed cold air," "humming with stored remorse"—appear in high-pressure moments. Template cadence runs: "She broke through, descending... She removed her gloves... She placed her palms..." across three consecutive beats. These patterns reduce propulsion and touch the closure sequence, triggering deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "construct bridges from silos" appears three times with only cosmetic variation; "empathetically decisive" is restated as "neither condescending pity nor brute administrative force" without added detail. Template cadence runs ("She positions… She begins… She sings…") across multiple paragraphs. Stock phrasing clusters in peak beats: "trembling but resolute," "vigorous tender melody," "profound relief of renewed connection." Baseline −0.6 to −1.4 applied for paraphrase loops and template stems; artifacts touch the closure beat ("successfully constructed bridges"), triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe overwriting pervades the text: nearly every sentence stacks metaphors and elevated diction without pattern-teaching or earned payoff. "Thoughts spiraling like double helices unraveling in slow motion, each strand a recursive algorithm" exemplifies density without clarity or momentum. Paraphrase loops recur: the mirror is "broken" and "jagged" multiple times; transformation and entanglement are restated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence appears in runs like "The mirror shards reflected… The canyon breathed… She was excavating…" Stock metaphors ("wildfire through chaparral," "quantum-knotted") and register drift into technical jargon harm immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("the transformation completed itself"), triggering the higher penalty range and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean with vivid individual images ("mist coiled through the entrance like breath from some sleeping beast," "sensation like walking through chilled honey"). However, template cadence and paraphrase loops recur: "The world turned inside out. The ceiling became the floor, and Elara fell upward…her hair streaming down toward the stone above her head" restates the inversion concept three times in adjacent clauses without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("serpentine," "clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze," "spectral analysis") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental accumulation rather than propulsion. The final paragraph lists future action ("calculating how to use them") instead of landing an image with undeniable cost, flattening the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high (each line advances setting, method, or stakes), and the loop check is clean—no paraphrase cycles. Minor overwriting: "symphonically minded" appears twice in close proximity, and "empathy in motion" is repeated verbatim. The final paragraph risks slight abstraction ("teach the silent earth to sing again"), but the closure image remains concrete. Zero template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high, and the prose is grammatically clean with strong vocabulary control. However, several paraphrase loops and near-duplicates appear: "the silence of the board" / "translate silence differently" / "translating the silence of the nexus" / "the silence suddenly spoke" / "the silence broke" / "the silence felt like invitation" recycles the silence motif without adding new pressure each time. Template cadence in mid-story: "He moved...He could feel...Castian moved again...He understood...He remained" creates a repetitive stem pattern. The final paragraph runs long with stacked abstractions ("difficult, hopeful beauty") that dilute the closure image's concreteness. These artifacts don't obscure causality but do dull momentum and prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("wounds in the sky," "frozen conversations," "broadcast alone"), occasionally mixing registers (mechanical "tumblers" beside poetic "sigh"). Several near-paraphrase loops appear: "the silence of fear and the silence of awe, between the quiet of isolation and the quiet of connection" repeats structure without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the workshop description ("He understood... He detected... He adjusted") and stock metaphor strings ("red and gold," "eternal dark") accumulate to moderate artifact debt. Information density is uneven—some beats (clasp mechanism) are vivid; others (fireworks backdrop) remain ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and grammar are solid, with no major causality breaks or spatial confusion. However, multiple prose artifacts cluster throughout: paraphrase loops ("the seed represented everything she sought to become: something that embraced its own contradictions, that could smell of death yet signify life, that grew upward while remaining firmly rooted in the dark" restates prior material without adding pressure), elevated diction runs ("olfactorily sensitive," "titan arum's parasitic youth," "undercurrent of wisdom," "putrefaction taught the nose"), and template cadence in the closing paragraph ("she would return daily… practicing the cultivation… tracking the invisible progress"). Filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she knew," "she recognized") dull immediacy in key beats. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; no major metaphor muddles occur, though "tide of air turned" mixes water and wind without clear bridging.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong concrete images (magnetic clamps, chromatic waves, water spiraling skyward). Information density is high in the middle third. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "those stone bridges that hovered" immediately followed by spatial restatement, and the "gathering of echoes" concept is restated across three lines without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("frozen lightning," "whirling silence") recur without fresh transformation. The figurative language in peak beats (touching the artifact, the data flood) remains functional but leans toward generic high-concept phrasing rather than body-specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies effectively (short declarative beats during measurement, longer synthesis in the final paragraph). Information density is high: most sentences do double work (e.g., "The patch served as both her talisman and her starting coordinate" merges emotional anchor with methodology). Minor template cadence in paragraph three: three consecutive "she + past-tense verb" openers ("She marked," "She was documenting," "She moved"). "Hazy precision" motif recurs purposefully but edges toward overwriting—"hazily beautiful in its terrible inevitability" stacks modifiers in a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops; spatial and causal sequencing is clean. Proofreading is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the climax carries figurative language ("sound exploded into prismatic geometry," "emotional cortex," "weaving them into a synesthetic tapestry") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraph two: "violet weight," "deep violet weight," "smooth as velvet" restate synesthetic perception without adding pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "each tone manifesting," "each bell tone caught" (−0.4). Register drift into academic lexicon ("electromagnetic song," "conceptual repricing") clashes with POV (−0.4). Stock metaphors: "circuit," "theorem," "tapestry." Cumulative artifacts approach −1.4; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is controlled with purposeful rhythm and vivid images ("notes falling into the dry air like stones into deep water," "gold leaf peeling like old skin"). However, severalparaphrase loops appear: the canyon's silence is described three times in close succession ("avalanchingly quiet," "palpable weight of absence," "memory of thunder echoed"), and the driftwood markers' function is restated across multiple beats without added detail. Sentence openings vary and information density is generally high, but figurative saturation in peak moments (the correction sequence) risks opacity—"weaving between worlds with each measured breath through the gilded instrument, her body passing through layers of existence like a thread through linen" stacks metaphors without advancing causality. No grammar errors or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but legible ("gaps...like missing teeth," "viscous black ink"). However, heavy metaphor concentration ("longitude of the heart," "latitude of grief," "liquid emotion," "coral," "fish") in the climax beats risks overwriting without sufficient pattern-teaching, per the Overwriting Check (−0.4 for density without payoff). Minor paraphrase loop: "borrowed personalities" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs without functional shift. No scaffold or template cadence, and clarity holds at closure, limiting deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several artifacts cluster: "vibrating sympathetically" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "fade" recurs as both noun and verb without pattern payoff; "germinate/germinating" loops across adjacent beats. Stock phrases appear in peak moments: "eyes widening," "reverent fingers," "teaching him that." Figurative density is high ("ancient silk," "bright as new copper," "electric prickle") without taught pattern. The final third stacks summary-like reflection ("understood then," "had learned that") that dilutes immediacy. No single artifact obscures closure, but cumulative drag prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "mist coiled around the translucent trunks like breath held too long," "frost ferns," "spectral ghosts," "neural pathway," "silicon structure resonating." Mixed metaphors appear: the prism forms a "bridge between her retina and the frost patterns," then frost "skips liquid entirely as if the emotion it carried was too volatile for water." Paraphrase loops surface: "the shifted hush that fell" recurs three times with minor synonym variation. Template cadence: "She did not touch... she learned to commune... she angled the prism." Sentence openings vary little in the middle third. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (prism refracts light *and* reads residue), but figurative overload in peak beats (sublimation, lavender scent, "burning confirmation") obscures propulsion. No clarity break at closure, but pervasive ornament and minor loops reduce momentum, triggering −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for template stems, total ~−1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies across the piece: long, hypotactic sentences in the setup give way to shorter, more decisive lines at closure. Information density is high—most sentences layer image, action, and thematic weight—but clarity occasionally suffers from metaphoric overloading: "raveling silence that had begun to knit itself closed around her, sealing her within the pattern" stacks three simultaneous metaphors (raveling, knitting, sealing) without clear physical referent. The phrase "stoically sparkling" recurs four times, and "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears twice verbatim, creating minor scaffold loops. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs appear, and syntax is varied. Grammar and tense are clean. However, elevated diction ("terrifyingly full of threads coming loose, unraveling from the universe's hem") occasionally drifts into abstraction that dulls concreteness, and the final paragraph's "her sacrifice complete yet invisible to any eye but the cosmos" edges toward telling. The prose propels without major stumbles, but the metaphoric density and stock lyric phrasing in peak beats (the ending) prevent entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, with strong imagery ("violet shadows," "seed vault crystallized by pressure"). However, pervasive overwriting burdens the text: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("whisper of steel," "suspended between understanding and confusion," "bridges to what came next"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear—"quietly determined spirit" echoed by "quiet determination" and "meek by nature" restated across paragraphs. Template cadence runs through the middle section: "She worked…," "Each blow was…," "She was meek…," "The silk dissolved…," "Elara felt…" Artifacts touch the closure beat ("no longer merely… but rather"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence in the opening and middle sections carries metaphor or sensory abstraction—creating a lush but occasionally opaque texture. Paraphrase loops appear: "weight of a withheld truth" / "heft of the silence" / "gravity of unspoken things" recycle the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the closing paragraphs with repeated "she would" constructions. The final third includes stock phrasing ("necessary pressure that kept her grounded while her mind wandered") and thematic summary that tells rather than shows. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the figurative load; at least one mixed metaphor ("weaving between worlds… the shard cut the air") blurs the mechanics of her movement.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("drowned in their own vigilance," "stones scattered like failed punctuation," "folded tight as a fish's spine"). Several register into elevated or slightly mixed vehicles ("the vocabulary of currents," "luminescent ache," "failed punctuation"), though most remain coherent. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "she [verb]" openers across multiple lines. Information density is strong, and propulsion holds, but the persistent figurative overlay in crisis moments dulls immediacy slightly. No major clarity breaks, but the overwriting is pervasive enough to prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high across nearly every sentence ("liquid luminescence," "heartbeat of a printing press reborn," "trees of parchment"), creating a steady metaphorical hum that dilutes urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 10, 14, and 22 restate the concept of light-as-darkness and shadow-as-preservation without advancing pressure. Template cadence ("The emerald lighthouse stood… The emerald lighthouse began… The lighthouse stood complete") and synonym churn (steering/shaping/bending narrative) accumulate. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmospheric texture rather than dual work. Deductions: figurative overload −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, totaling −1.4 within Q7; baseline ~6.8, adjusted to 5.4.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence openings vary and information density is high; most lines serve dual purpose (advancing insight and charging imagery). The sun-trail tracking provides concrete propulsion through repeated observation → adjustment → realization cycles. However, figurative density in the second half accumulates without relief: "legends accumulated like sediment," "mineral stain like dye," "valley-mist wonder," "spores on morning air," "radiant, accumulating tales" cluster in adjacent beats, creating a metaphoric pile-up that slows momentum. Template cadence appears in reflective turns: "She understood that…," "She saw now that…," "She smiled, feeling…" The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("radiant, accumulating tales," "threads of their morning stories") where a single concrete image would sharpen closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but the metaphoric saturation in peak beats triggers overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language saturates most lines ("honeycomb of corridors," "vapor-trails of sleeping minds," "condensation," "fireflies against ancient wood"), creating lush texture but occasional density overload without pattern-teaching payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "distilled into measurable units" / "quantified sorrow—milliliters of mourning, grams of regret" restates the same content adjacently. Template cadence in early beats: multiple "she [verb]" stems without rhythmic variation. Propulsion slows mid-piece during dream-mapping exposition. Clarity remains high; no muddled metaphors, no orientation debt. Information density is solid but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("chorus of auroras," "sonic threads," "gravity of collective remembering"), but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "binding and liberating simultaneously, a tone of bound release" stacks near-synonyms without added clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("her motivation burning like cold fire: to rekindle this dying realm" / "desperation of one who knew")—adjacent lines restate intent rather than advance pressure. Template cadence emerges in the final paragraph with repeated "as" and "and" constructions. Information density is high, but scaffold phrasing ("the act of swaddling was intimate and absolute, a promise that…") externalizes meaning rather than trusting the image. No severe artifact penalty applied, but the accumulation lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, pervasive overwriting in the final third undermines momentum: "to touch the world only by withdrawing from it, to give by concealing himself," "to stay while leaving, to hide while revealing, to remain alone yet infinitely connected," and "the paradox was complete" stack abstract summaries without fresh imagery. Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines ("staying while leaving" recurs three times in the final third; "nestled paradoxes" and "enlarged tranquility" repeat without reweighting). Template cadence is mild but present in the triple infinitive construction ("to touch... to give... to remain"). These artifacts cluster in the closure beat, triggering −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Early paragraphs are tighter and more concrete; the scaffolding concentrates at the end where it most harms resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information load per sentence. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports rhythm. However, multiple artifacts cluster: repetitive phrasing ("creeping," "tenuous," "heuristically gentle" appear as labels without dramatic pressure), near-paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("tended her garden...teaching the city"), and elevated diction that occasionally obscures concrete action. The line "worked heuristically gentle" is syntactically awkward (missing "with" or "-ly"). Metaphor coherence holds, but stacked modifiers and clause chains slow momentum in high-stakes beats. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, dulling the closure beat with scaffold summary ("She continued her creeping observations...requiring daily renewal").

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, action, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative design. However, minor overwriting appears: "quartz hush" recurs four times without clear pattern payoff, and some figurative language stacks without cost—"luminous potential," "spectral thread," "mnemonic energy" cluster in adjacent lines. Paraphrase loop: "measure what remained before the edge of oblivion swallowed them" and later "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeat the frame with synonym drift. Template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elara [verb]." These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion slightly. Closure image (blank slide, reflection, prayer) is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries strong images (barnacles as rusted coins, the pier counting down), but template cadence and phrase recycling appear throughout: "false starts" repeats five times, "comforting unease" three times, "curiously steadfast" twice, "the sound of trust breaking" twice. Several beats paraphrase adjacent content without added pressure—paragraph 5 restates the truce and hours-feeling-like-minutes already established. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the comforting unease deepens," "the truce of hush creates a vacuum") dull immediacy in peak moments. Sentence openings vary little; many paragraphs begin with "She" or "The." Information density is moderate; some lines advance action, others restate mood. No loops obscure causality at closure, but accumulated artifacts lower momentum and cap high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching: "skin phosphorescent with doubt," "trailing weather behind them like a bridal train," "terrestrially cosmic" repeated across beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("sensing through taste changes that had guided her kind" / "the method of sensing through taste changes" / "The method never lied"). Register drifts into expository abstraction ("evolving relationship with a sentient world," "architecture of destiny in flavors that mapped emotional weather systems across time"). Template cadence: repeated "The [noun]-bearer [verb]" structures flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors (bridal train, ribbons of colored light) and therapy-speak ("emotional weather systems") dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "creativity corked tight" / "uncork her suppressed creativity," "auroral sorrow" repeated three times, "inescapable calling" appears twice in similar framing. Template cadence runs: "She could perfectly recall… yet she could not remember…" mirrors itself unnecessarily. Metaphors are strained and mixed ("creativity corked," "welding fractured confidence," "cathedral waiting for its chronicler"). Figurative density in most sentences of the climax beat (hairpins, mathematical poetry, sculpture metaphor, welding metaphor) without pattern-teaching. Stock phrasing: "glittering tomb," "first true sculpture," "dawn of authentic vision." Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and metaphor muddle touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good, though some beats lean toward ornamental description ("vines heavy with tomatoes brushed their shoulders"). A few template-cadence runs appear ("The air grew thicker... condensation dripping... When they reached"). Minor paraphrase loop: "lost conversations" recurs as a phrase without added pressure. The closure beat avoids scaffold, but the penultimate paragraph stacks metaphorical intensifiers ("sanctuary," "breathe and grow") that edge toward overwriting without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several issues accumulate: paraphrase loops (the iceberg's preservation and color are restated three times across paragraphs), template cadence in the bell-ringing sequence ("The first bell rang... The second bell sang... the third of light, the fourth of..."), and stock metaphors ("truth made audible," "cathedral of amazement"). The loop about "symphonies of truth" and "color of wonder" recurs without added pressure. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and prevent clean high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries noticeable pattern debt. "Strangely organic" appears five times, "fragmented wholeness" three times, and "miniaturize" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without reweighting. The phrase "by containing chaos" appears twice in near-identical constructions. Several lines loop conceptually: "inner static" is resolved, then "finally resolved," then "cleared into something resembling peace." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 for paraphrase loops and template phrases per the artifact screen). The final image remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple ornamental metaphors stack without causal purpose: "sandstorm frozen in time," "sandstorm calm," "healing water," "fine desert silt" repeat the desert image without developing it. Template cadence appears in the investigation sequence: "She began at... She moved through... She learned that..." Filter verbs ("watched," "saw," "knew") cluster in high-pressure moments. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs two and three both explain that Maya will solve the mystery by listening/following. The line "She wanted you to have this" is acknowledged as unearned within the text itself, breaking immersion. Artifactual phrasing ("the attribute of leads through following") reads as prompt-speak rather than natural narration.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lyrical and image-dense ("bioluminescent fungi painted," "algorithm that sang"), with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Two frictions lower the score: the spider-web simile recurs three times in near-identical phrasing without tightening meaning (paraphrase loop), and several lines stack decorative metaphors in adjacent sentences without propulsion ("patients of a spider," "lyrical mathematics," "choreography of defiance"). The final paragraph compresses multiple metaphors (bridge, drowning, breathing, strand) that approach muddle. Clarity holds, but momentum sags under ornamental weight in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and carries high information density: "pockets of gravity that pulled at her boots with varying intensity" and "grounds swirling into configurations that her intuition read as coordinates" do double duty. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "the gravity fluctuated mysteriously, creating pockets of gravity" and "the patterns in coffee grounds resolved into a map, clustering toward a junction" restate without adding pressure. The final paragraph stacks summary ("understood at last," "She would return") where a sharp image would suffice. Minor template cadence in the opening ("massive humpback had beached… its death throes… triggering").

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked metaphors and register drift: "terrestrially cosmic—rooted in soil yet spanning galaxies, as intimate as soil and vast as nebulae" mixes vehicles incoherently (−0.6). Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching: "silence rushed in…a vacuum nature abhorred yet she commanded" followed immediately by "the smoothed hush flowed from her lips…creating a silence so complete it had weight, texture, gravity." Paraphrase loops ("mapping silence…charting invisible contours…creating a cartography of quiet") and template cadence across the middle paragraphs (−0.8 cumulative). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and high information density in most beats. However, phrase recurrence becomes visible: "patiently nimble" appears three times in identical or near-identical form, and "agreed upon lies" recurs four times, twice in the final paragraph alone. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "interrogate the walls... interrogate the doorframes" and "she brought... she pressed... she remained." Figurative language is dense throughout—"teeth in a key," "architectural static," "grammar hidden in lintels"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting in peak beats. The final line ("agreed upon lies that felt more honest than any living speech") delivers thematic summary rather than image-driven closure. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: phrase loops −0.5, elevated diction density in closure beat −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting throughout: "flowers heavy as tapestries bowed under their own perfume," "bioluminescence rippled through the stems like captured starlight drowning in slow motion," "tragically radiant luminescence that marked sacred transformation, the kind of light that existed only when something beautiful was being destroyed." Density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching flattens momentum (−0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops: the shell's containment of dangerous memory is restated across three sentences in paragraph one; isolation/independence theme cycles through near-synonyms. Template cadence in final paragraph: "still a skeptic, still charmed, but no longer afraid" follows "no longer just a prison...but a sanctuary." Mixed metaphor: starlight cannot drown. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("metastasize through the collective unconscious") clashes with sensory garden setting (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty −0.9 in Q7; artifacts appear in final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "unlink" appears five times, "calibrated treason" three times, "wisely enduring" twice, "heritage rose thorn" repeatedly as a full phrase. Template cadence runs through the middle section—"She had discovered... She had used... She had survived..."—flattening momentum. Stock metaphors ("drip of water through stone," "chains she had carried") and elevated diction ("pearl twilight," "mineral music") create textural density but also slow propulsion. The final third accumulates these artifacts without clear payoff, triggering penalties per the loop/scaffold screen and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("frozen river of light," "shimmer of quartz and shadow"). The phrase "webs of intrigue" recurs without evolving meaning, bordering on loop. Some constructions are overwritten: "the reed-blown melancholy of her voice weaving new patterns into the ancient nexus" stacks modifiers without added clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor well, but mid-passage exposition ("the Archivists had discovered that human consciousness could be imprinted") summarizes rather than dramatizes the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful ("salt stains like tear tracks," "voice like cracking ice"). However, several beats recycle conceptual ground: "weave truth carefully" appears three times across opening, middle, and close without pressure gain; "cameo appearances" and "windows of connection" are restated in adjacent lines without added detail. The final paragraph loops through "borrowed starlight" twice and re-summarizes the method ("piecing together truth from subconscious debris") already established. Template stems ("she had traced," "she had analyzed," "she thought of") cluster in the second half, creating mild momentum drag. No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative redundancy lowers density.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Density is high and sentences advance atmosphere and character. However, the piece suffers from heavy ornamental layering: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle carries figurative language or elevated metaphor ("moon paths—the silver trails," "scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "invisible cartographies"), creating rhythmic monotony and register drift that dulls propulsion in peak beats. Template cadence appears in repeated "the [noun]'s [adjective] [noun]" constructions. Paraphrase loops: the concept of "hidden effort" and "invisible patterns" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. The final paragraph over-explains the thematic conclusion rather than trusting the image. Apply −0.8 for density without variance, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Information density is strong in the middle third (letters, stillpoint mechanics, calibration). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] was [state]" constructions across the explanation beats. Paraphrase loop: "The stillpoint was not a place but a frequency" followed immediately by "creating the invisible dome that repelled the dust" restates mechanism without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "storms circled like hungry wolves" and "cracks in ice" are functional but unearned. No loops touch the closure beat, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, imagery is dense and specific (cobalt glass, copper aerials, gray wool clouds), and most lines advance atmosphere or ritual. However, several adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "he wanted the carpenter to break the throne so that ancient shadows might crawl" immediately followed by elaboration on what the shadows require; "The shadows were not evil, merely sleeping" followed by their waking conditions. Template cadence appears in the final third ("They would not stop…but they would complicate…add grit…introduce whimsy"), stacking parallel clauses that dilute momentum. The phrase "loneliness complete and therefore perfect, a hollow vessel ringing with the frequency of change" layers abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen. No major loops, but figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally obscures propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "captured sounds" / "capturing sounds in glass jars" / "released the captured sounds in glass jars" across three paragraphs; "lonesome splendor" repeats identically twice. Template cadence in the backstory third ("He remembered...the way she had trusted...a trust he had shattered") and synonym churn around "vagrant" / "vagrant penny poet" / "vagrant verses." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "auditory ghosts" and "phonetic map" work, though "gleaned redemption" in the closure paragraph feels label-like. Line-level clarity is strong except for these patterned artifacts. Applying −0.8 for loops and template runs that touch but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense ("breath crystallizing," "banner in the dying wind," "liquify the air") and occasionally effective, but several metaphors strain coherence: the key "vibrates with a frequency only she could feel thrumming against her palm like a second heartbeat" mixes tactile and auditory registers awkwardly. Template cadence appears in runs of identical stems ("She was," "She had," "She knew," "She sprinted") across adjacent sentences in the opening third, triggering a −0.4 deduction. Phrase loops recur: "logically emotional," "fleshly ethereal," "sacred artifact" repeat without added pressure. The closure beat ("saved by the marriage of engineering and soul, flesh and spirit intertwined") lands on abstract summary rather than propulsive image, dulling momentum. Combined artifacts trigger a −1.0 deduction in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is mostly clear with purposeful rhythm, but several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea: "sculpt patience from impatience, chipping away at her own frantic anger until it became a diamond-edged tool rather than a wildfire" and "learning that freedom was not seized but earned through restraint" restate the core metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final two paragraphs (repeated "The [noun] would..." and "Now the real work began—to teach..."). Figurative density is high ("diamond-edged tool," "spectral bridge," "tectonic lullaby") but mixed vehicles occasionally clash (sculpting patience, tracking truths). Minor deductions for paraphrase loops and stock metaphor reliance ("wildfire," "chains").

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the prose suffers from recurring abstract constructions and near-paraphrase loops: "entangled memories" appears twice, "empirical observation/observations" three times, "controlling influence" twice, "watchfully calm" twice. The phrase "fortified vulnerability manifesting as deliberate breaths" exemplifies register drift—clinical diction clashing with embodied action. Several beats stack "had [verb]" constructions (had been, had taught, had called, had died, had instilled, had known, had filed, had chosen, had forced, had wanted) creating template cadence in the backstory-heavy middle. Minor clarity issue: "his grief and his entangled" reads ambiguous (whose grief?).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (long reflective sentences, short oath moment). Information density is high in the discovery beat ("serial number matching… not the replica"). However, the piece accumulates text artifacts: "vibrant hush" recurs three times without pattern payoff; "aptly deliberate" appears twice in similar phrasing; "the clockwork heart" is repeated across adjacent paragraphs without reweighting. Figurative language clusters densely ("dust motes," "violet desperation," "hammered notes") without coherent pattern. The phrase "embodying the vibrant hush" in the opening paragraph mixes metaphor (voice cannot embody hush). Sentence stems repeat ("He had come," "He would carry," "He would not rush"). Apply −1.0 cumulative for loop and artifact spread.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance Kip's task or build workshop texture. Sentence openings vary (subject, participial, temporal). Two minor scaffold patterns: "The algorithm didn't calculate...it calculated" and "didn't need it anymore—they could see" are functional but formulaic. Figurative language ("floating monstrosity of brass and bile," "a language that tasted like copper," "rippling through the acid sea in concentric circles of reverent absurdity") is vivid but clusters heavily in descriptive passages; in the peak beat (cog alignment and bell ringing), metaphor density is high without obscuring causality. Rhythm breathes appropriately: short bursts at the climax, longer reflection after. Pronoun references are clean, tense stable. No paraphrase loops or grammar errors detected.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with strong images—"digital snow through the mainframe," "threads frayed from zero-gravity handling"—but several lines loop conceptually. "The sequence multiplied, threading through disco tracks and synth-pop ballads, digital fossils of human emotion that refused true deletion" and the prior sentence both describe recurring numbers in music without advancing causality. The final paragraph stacks abstractions: "liminal space," "feedback loops," "ghost frequencies," "suspended animation," compressing crucial plot beats into summary. Opening stem "Elara was brightly attentive" uses passive construction where active choice would sharpen. Minor template cadence in the exposition-heavy middle ("The company claimed... She suspected... She followed...").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy overwriting in the opening sentence stacks five dependent clauses with mixed metaphors (roots drinking mist, ice grinding like giants). Paraphrase loop: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" / "threads of darkness that moved independently" restates the same idea. Figurative density saturates peak beats—"paper boats on a dark stream," "strange, heavy fruit," "compressed starlight"—without pattern-teaching or payoff. The phrase "weighted breath before reply" is repeated verbatim three times, twice in the final paragraph. Template stems ("She [verb] the…") run through the mirror-positioning sequence without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with vivid moments like "ice clicked and chimed like glass bells" and "snow that stung and cleansed." However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "grip reality loosely" appears three times, and the "fold in patience" is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. The elevated diction is consistent but risks overwriting in places ("lineage that stretched forward," "aperture in the fog"). Filter verbs ("she found," "she realized") appear but do not stack densely. The final image is strong, but the middle third carries minor redundancy that blunts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("diesel sigh," "skeletal gestures," "carbon becoming sugar becoming spirit"). However, the piece suffers from conceptual redundancy: "destined mismatches" recurs five times with minimal variation, and adjacent paragraphs paraphrase the same insight (Marcus as necessary opposite, separation as maturation). Template cadence appears in stacked "she realized/understood/thought" constructions, and figurative density in reflective beats (fire/transformation, root/leaf, wine/love) obscures momentum. The final third loops thematic statements rather than advancing through image alone. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.4 for register drift into philosophical abstraction at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings show diversity. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("silver dust," "memory-stone," "whisperfield calm"). However, several phrases repeat across beats without added pressure: "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" (four times), "murmuring pavilion" (four times), "conjured clearing/clearings" (five times), "peripheral awareness" (three times), "strangely honest" (three times). This recurrence reads as labeling rather than charged callback, creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. The final paragraph drifts into summary ("adding new murmurs to the pavilion's endless conversation") rather than landing a propulsive image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("Through peripheral awareness," "The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes") accumulate without evolving function. No major grammar or clarity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary purposefully ("Elara adjusted," "From the map case," "Through the spring," "On the autumn equinox"). Information density is high in the opening two paragraphs, then slackens into summary in paragraphs three and four: "came initially out of curiosity, then stayed because" recaps rather than dramatizes. Minor template cadence in paragraph four: "she noticed how… she realized now…" adjacency. The phrase "as vines climbed" recurs three times, functioning as motif rather than loop, but "perceptively calm" appears twice within similar constructions. No major artifacts obscure closure, but scaffold phrasing ("her presence remained," "she intended to linger") and elevated diction ("transmute," "resilience," "catalyzed") occasionally drift from the urgency expected in peak moments. Apply −0.6 for template adjacency and scaffold density, landing mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences ("fluid words," "mutable logic," "cathedral of expired definitions," "floating commas") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 for density without escalation). Repeated key phrases ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences," "sonically reflective," "pattern of growth") function as motifs but also create mild paraphrase loops. The final paragraph restates earlier ideas (crystal placement, new grammars, weathered innocence) without new propulsion. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Clarity and grammar are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer image, concept, and emotional charge. Rhythm varies purposefully (longer spirals early, fragmented urgency at the convergence). However, several phrases approach purple without full clarity: "sculpture of frozen fog that hummed with the shape of a telephone" strains coherence, and "acoustic shadow of entropy accelerating" is abstract. The piece avoids loops and scaffolding, but figurative density in consecutive lines ("magnetic ghosts," "crystalline fog formations," "mute pantomime") nudges toward overwriting in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density ("titanium beams began to tremble," "counting seconds that no longer corresponded to Earth time," "accumulated weight of unrecorded light pressing against the walls like water against a failing dam," "moon's silver light pooled in the valleys of her own worn hands") pervades high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "spinning in endless circles" / "rotating faster" / "its motion now a comfort rather than a curse." Template cadence runs through the final third ("The observatory groaned as it reached escape velocity... The foundations stopped shaking... Elara adjusted the final lens..."), and register drifts into academic abstraction ("changelessly constant in its hysteria," "threshold of perceptible time") that clashes with hands-on repair work. Stock metaphors ("violence of a waking giant," "cups holding water") and simultaneous processing during physical crisis further reduce clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but overwriting clusters appear throughout: "the quality of decisively kind intervention," "pulsing stillness," "saturated with meaning," "ancient drifting." Mixed metaphor: "rain rising upward in defiance of gravity" is physically unclear as ozone scent mechanism. Template-cadence runs in the hymning catalog ("of the water glass…of the crease…of the dust motes"). The final two paragraphs loop the closure concept with synonym churn ("hymned into eternity," "hymning them into architecture," "hymned into the architecture"). Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loop at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("shadows stretching impossibly upward," "reality folded like parchment"). However, paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "She had to relearn the rhythm of her own movements, adjusting her pace until her stride matched exactly the frequency of the key's ticking" restates the task without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the middle passage ("Each step was a word, each breath a punctuation") reads decorative. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she had discovered," "she understood") dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so penalty is modest (−0.6 to −0.8 range).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs—and the prose avoids loops or scaffolding. However, figurative language crowds several high-pressure beats: "cracked her rationalism like a dropped porcelain doll," "impossible geometries," "nostalgic innovation," "mistakes into constellations," "stitched together from old wounds" cluster densely without breathing room, triggering the overwriting check (−0.4). Additionally, "shrewdly innocent" appears three times with identical phrasing, a paraphrase-loop artifact (−0.2). The bone-setting beat is concrete and clear, lifting the score back into the high-6 range, but the final paragraph's stacked metaphors (tooth, bone, garden, constellation, thorns-into-gold) blur rather than sharpen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure breathes with the beats. Information density is high, but several lines loop conceptually: "her breath synchronized with the circular patterns" and "each motion a meditation" restate the same devotional quality without adding pressure. The phrase "zephyr bloom of dawn-star light" appears twice with slight variation, and "weigh" recurs as both literal and metaphorical gesture without clear differentiation. Figurative language is dense throughout ("serpentine passages whispering," "mist... like curious spirits") without always advancing causality. No severe artifact, but cumulative paraphrase and template cadence ("she did not pause... Instead, she reached") lower the score by ~0.6 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies; information density is high in setting detail. Overwriting visible: figurative language saturates most sentences without relief ("honeyed hush," "golden grammar," "fungal networks that hummed"), creating density fatigue. Paraphrase loop present: "grafting new meaning" appears multiple times across paragraphs in near-synonym form (splice grief, rewrite code, translate shame). Template cadence in mid-section: "She had come not to hide… She had not come to forget… She would return tomorrow…" Minor clarity issue: "proffer" used twice in abstract contexts without clear object-action link until the pendant placement.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    High figurative density without pattern-teaching: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstraction, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear—"shapes of different hopes" recurs across paragraphs without added detail; "lucidly watchful" is mentioned twice in similar phrasing. Template stems dominate: "She moved… She had come… She knew… She pressed… She watched…" runs across a dozen lines. The closing-pages/swirling-hush motifs feel ornamental rather than causally active. Mixed registers (lyric philosophy + concrete ritual) blur momentum. Stock phrases: "wild things," "opened a door," "final page."

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shooting upward to entwine the arbor's beams with thick, fruitful branches heavy with grain and gourd and clusters of wine-dark berries" stacks modifiers without urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "The remedy was working, the land drinking in the melody like rain after drought. The soil itself seemed to exhale" restates the same idea. Template cadence runs: "She began to hum… She did not merely sing… She could see lights… She was tinkerer and priestess." Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation: "seemed to be holding," "seemed to exhale." The opening sentence buries the lead in a thicket of subordinate clauses. Information density is mid-range; many lines perform single jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("ink strokes against aurora's shimmer," "cold fire burning blue-white silhouettes"), but density is uneven: multiple adjacent sentences restate Elara's patience and the starlight's properties without advancing pressure. Template stems recur ("she had," "the orchard remained," "the flash-paper") across the final paragraph. No loops break causality, but the high metaphor-to-action ratio in peak beats (sealing, ignition) slows propulsion. The final paragraph risks paraphrase when summarizing prior motifs without new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Density is high, with nearly every sentence layering technical detail, metaphor, and backstory (thirty years coaxing tumblers, nine days of dawn mapping). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "the timer did not measure hours but harvested them" is immediately restated as "collecting temporal resonance in its mainspring"; "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" appears three times with minor variation. Template cadence in the middle third ("He studied…," "He sought…," "He filed…") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "time itself had bled out and left only this copper corpse" (blood/corpse) clashes with "the harvest of echoes" (agricultural) and "the lock now turned" (mechanical). Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe density and loop issues pervade. Multiple paraphrase cycles: paragraphs 7 and 21 both declare Elara "boundary-lessly trapped"; paragraphs 13 and 19 rehearse the same collection-and-measurement action. Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" openers across a dozen paragraphs. Metaphors pile without coherence: "shingled hush" (fish scales of silence), "whalebone reverie" (skeletal dreaming), "golden spirals" (galaxies of dust)—each vivid in isolation but stacked to the point of muddle. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap and artifact penalties apply: baseline −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("dreamed in whalebone").

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "Here and gone, she thought" / "Here and gone" (later); "crystallized time into suspended prisms" / "Through crystallized time, she saw"; "The phrase had become her mantra" followed immediately by exposition of that mantra's meaning. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The lions were gone, the tent folded, the crowds dispersed" / "She would finish the carving tomorrow, sand it smooth, treat it with oil" stack parallel constructions without variation. Stock metaphor strings: "rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl" and "unfolded like waking cats." Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems across the closure window.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is imagistic and rhythmically controlled, with vivid figurative language ("painted horses," "dandelion seeds," "canyon of her eroded ambitions"). However, metaphor density in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("years pour out," "crystal narratives that hovered," "seeds to be grown in light") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "chronologically confused" recurs three times without added meaning; "fractured stillness" appears twice as a thematic label. Template stems ("She was," "She had," "The ghost") open multiple consecutive sentences in the exchange scene, creating rhythmic flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (maze, fossilized hearts, translation metaphor) serves thematic coherence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not as it was intended, but as it needed to be" echoes earlier "not as a spaceport, but as a greenhouse"; "maze of intentions" recurs three times without evolving function. Key climactic work ("She worked through the night, rerouting...creating loops") is summarized rather than shown, flattening momentum. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she perceived patterns," "she felt the stoic wonder") dull immediacy in high-importance beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm is controlled with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (sensory + memory). However, pervasive overwriting harms momentum: "excruciatingly gentle sigh," "violet precursor of dawn that thieves called the hidden sunrise," "ghost tempo haunting her careful, clockwork existence," "spectral scales that danced," "vibration of her surrender." Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (kneeling, opening the case, standing) without pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed metaphors ("bear this object," "bird's egg or a heart barely beating") blur clarity. Template stems recur ("She reached," "She did not," "She remained," "She stood," "She would return"). Apply −0.7 for density and coherence issues, −0.4 for template cadence touching closure paragraph, and −0.3 for filter-verb stack ("seemed," "understood," "could")—total within-band deduction ~−1.4, with artifacts in the final third disallowing 9+ globally and capping at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies across the piece, but several paragraphs open with "She/Mara" or "The" in template runs that flatten propulsion. Information density is high: most sentences advance character understanding or world detail. However, paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 10 ("Her motivation had shifted...understanding the architecture of lies") restates the stake already established in paragraph 4 without added pressure. Mixed metaphor in "the serene upheaval...quiet violence of paradigm shift" where "serene" and "violence" clash without clear voice motivation. Figurative density is high throughout—"fractured reflection," "oil-slick water," "architecture of lies," "molecular structure"—and some images (twilight, shadow, architecture) recur purposefully, but others feel decorative. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("informed but not imprisoned by the architecture she had learned to read") that dilate rather than compress. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun confusion. The piece avoids loops in peak beats, but scaffold sentences ("She had learned," "She had become," "She realized") repeat stems across paragraphs 8, 9, 14 without varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is largely clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful cadence. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (e.g., "the rope was ancient hemp, weathered to the color of bone, and along its length were tied hundreds of knots"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "infinitely patient" recurs three times without new pressure; "ancient methods" / "lost techniques" / "primordial crafts" cycle as near-synonyms. The decoding sequence ("coaxing meaning," "persuading the rope," "coaxed the secret") stacks similar constructions without advancing action. Stock metaphors ("archives were never meant for paper," "seeds that would grow") appear in peak beats without fresh specificity. Deduct −0.6 for loops and template stems, per patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with strong figurative language (thread as compass needle, geography of healing). However, several sentences approach overwriting: "the lonesome splendor of survival—the way a single thread could suggest an entire tapestry, the way an empty harbor could still hold the echo of sails" stacks metaphors without adding new pressure. The phrase "vividly descriptive" appears twice, creating a minor paraphrase loop tied to the required attribute. Sentence openings vary, and no severe scaffolding or loops appear, but figurative density in the final third dulls immediacy slightly. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("thunder wrapped in silk," "mathematics of organic memory"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elian [verb]" or "He [verb]," and several sentences restate the flawed-genesis concept without added pressure ("permanence required the elimination of decay" / "cradle that could sustain metal but not feathers"). Stock phrases ("bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie") recur without reweighting. The assembly sequence and hatch are clear, but overwriting in reflective beats ("hypothesizing about everything from thermal gradients to the emotional state of the last living mother bird") slows momentum and drifts into padding.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated abstraction ("genetic compulsion toward flame," "baptism by fire," "ghost she refused to drown," "singing with the cellular possibility"). Template cadence appears in repeated "she + past-tense verb" stems across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "scars can sing" / "singing scars" / "scars finally singing" cycles without added meaning. "Gracefully alert" appears twice as a recycled phrase. The closure beat—"scars finally singing in the language of tide and renewal, loud enough to drown the past"—stacks metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Artifacts touch the ending, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and many lines carry dual work (e.g., "Each fragment caught the dying light, guiding her through the maze of dry fountains where water had once carried whispers between neighborhoods, connecting the living with their ancestors"). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: multiple lines open with "The" or "She," and several sentences deploy stacked modifiers ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative mind," "sidereal patience") that read as prompt-label inserts rather than organic prose. "Defiant hush" appears three times, two as identical phrases, creating a loop. Figurative language is dense without always clarifying—"breath held too long," "invisible weight," "trapped light"—and some metaphors blur (geese create a "temporal pocket" without clear mechanics). Information density is high, but scaffold phrases like "her motivation was clear" and "she understood" externalize rather than dramatize. No major causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Overall: strong texture with persistent template cadence and label-speak that prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff ("violet dusk," "watercolor ghosts," "whispered secrets of entropy," "wind through wheat"), creating density that obscures propulsion rather than charging it. Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "share light without using fire" / "illuminate...without consuming" / "seeing clearly without being blinded"; "turned a calculating machine gear" / "the gear clicked" / "the gear's hypnotic spin" across adjacent passages. Template cadence runs (subject-verb-modifier, often with participial openers) flatten rhythm. Persistent artifacts −1.2 in Q7; spread into closure region disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or thematic material. Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing images are charged. However, significant figurative overloading pervades peak beats: "the sun bled violet," "thundering calm," "trapped moonlight," "her voice like distant thunder rolling across a still lake," "a chord resonating across the migration season," "the mesh," "pressed flower between the pages," "thundering, perfect calm"—nearly every sentence in the final third stacks metaphor without letting image breathe. Template cadence emerges in repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [past tense]" constructions across the second half. Paraphrase loops appear: "grief had no single shape but infinite dimensions" closely echoes the prior "collective grief was the chord" realization. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and flatten the closure image's specificity. Baseline −0.8 in Q7 for density and loop; an additional −0.3 for elevated register drift in peak beats; partial recovery for strong tactile anchors ("chisel," "mallet," "cut the ribbon").

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: "the pause in the pendulum's swing" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs 2 and 3), "searing reverie" twice (paragraphs 4 and 6), and filter-verb stacks cluster in paragraph 2 ("understood," "knew," "watched"). The phrase "emerged through the tiny inscriptions" in paragraph 6 is metaphorically muddy—does he emerge *via* using them or *out of* his past? These loops and unclear constructions dull momentum in non-closure beats. The opening and closing lines are strong, and the climactic adjustment is clear, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is high; causality and spatial choreography track cleanly. However, figurative density is unrelenting—"velveteen gloom," "sentinel forgotten by time," "waking ghost," "geometry of sacrifice," "filament of intention," "plush shadows"—appearing in nearly every beat without escalation or payoff tied to pressure. Rhythm is uniform; sentence openings favor participial and prepositional phrases in a static pattern. Minor paraphrase loop: "uncharted echoes" repeats across paragraphs without evolving meaning. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the prose prioritizes texture over propulsion. The final paragraph succeeds in cadence and image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: metaphor density in most sentences without pattern-teaching ("prism of cold fire," "rope that others might climb toward tomorrow," "virgin parchment"). Paraphrase loops recur (paragraphs 2 and 5 both describe the frozen lake as sustaining life beneath rigidity). Template cadence appears in the third paragraph: "she had mapped…she was groundedly imaginative…she would write…" The final paragraph's summary mode—"She had prevailed through predictive modeling"—tells closure instead of dramatizing it. Figurative muddle in peak beats (kingfisher ink "distilled essence of questions that had never been asked") obscures rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "spin silence into silver thread" and "dust… a library" work, but "thistled calm" and "heat shimmer above summer roads" feel ornamental rather than propulsive. The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("dust continued its storytelling," "narratives that bypassed language") without advancing causality or image (−0.6). Sentence openings vary and rhythm is controlled, but information density drops in the epilogue section. No fatal clarity breaks, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is imagistically rich but suffers from scaffold patterns: repeated "He…" and "The…" sentence openings across adjacent paragraphs, paraphrase loops ("incomplete information" appears three times with similar framing), and metaphor density that occasionally muddles rather than clarifies ("vanishing point" used both literally and figuratively without clear distinction). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias [verb]" or "The [noun]." Mixed metaphor: "waves smoothing stone" for memory erasure clashes with earlier "mill grinding flour" for bone destruction. Strongest lines ("each fragment reflecting a different year of her accumulating silence") demonstrate control, but pervasive repetition and filter-verb stacks ("felt the porcelain shards warm," "watched it settle") dull immediacy. Apply −1.2 for combined loop/template/filter debt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often purposeful (sedimentary layers, ribcage leviathan, moon pulled from murky water), but several metaphors in high-pressure beats verge on overwriting: "truth became a diamond of unbearable density," "stories that flowed like swamp water without banks or borders." Template cadence appears in the reflection block: "The sedimentary layers of history showed... Yet the competing narrative had taken root... But the rational rebel observed..." (three parallel constructions in sequence). Information density is high and propulsion is mostly clean, but the metaphor load in the middle third slows momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; grammar and sequence are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "expectantly resigned reverence," "traveled stillness—a quality earned through years of navigating suspicion and loss," "frequencies of fear." Figurative density ("like incense or memory," "portal to another understanding," "map of absences") appears in most sentences of key beats without payoff that sharpens closure. Template cadence runs: "The sound was incomplete… waiting for other tones… he had created through precise restraint." Paraphrase loops ("harmony came not by adding complexity, but by subtracting noise—stripping away the discordant frequencies") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure image, triggering −1.7 baseline plus register drift and stock metaphor penalties totaling approximately −2.0.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "overgrown with thorny recollections," "choking her capacity," "stagnant time made visible and liquid," "alchemy of the informally wise." Runs of abstract noun phrases ("synaptic echoes," "phantom pains," "cortical space," "explosive organic growth") create register drift and slow momentum in the closure sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "Her neural pathways had become dangerously overgrown" restates "heavy with the unprocessed sorrow of generations past" without added pressure. The final two paragraphs stack thematic summaries that dilute the image of the ripening fruit. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with controlled rhythm; sentences vary in length and structure. Figurative language is heavy ("amber light of nectar dusk," "liquid light," "pollen during moments of systemic collapse") but mostly coherent. Minor template cadence appears in the middle section: repeated "The" sentence openers and participle constructions ("calling it garbage," "watching her descend"). The phrase "residual static" and "nectar dusk" recur effectively. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, with most sentences advancing Maya's method, the setting's wrongness, or thematic weight. Rhythm varies appropriately (longer contemplative sentences in exposition, shorter beats at moments of discovery). However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "The houses weren't haunted; they were listening" / "The aliveness wasn't intrusion but accumulation" / "The houses weren't shells but sponges"—a pattern of negation-then-correction that becomes mechanical across three uses. Figurative density occasionally overloads: "hushed blaze of interior light, neither fully lamp nor fully bioluminescence" stacks metaphoric vehicles without full coherence. The phrase "she had come to understand" appears twice, creating minor loop. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-passage artifacts prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and many lines multi-task (foxglove as color/poison/medicine, fissure as entry/conduit/thematic anchor), but figurative density in high-pressure beats—"prismatic doubt," "necrotic belief from healthy tissue," "polyculture of maybe," "stained-glass vessel"—approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure. Paraphrase loop: "murderers and saviors both, prison and sanctuary" restated as "mercy and judgment could share the same stained-glass vessel" without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "no longer X but Y" structure repeats across multiple beats without variation. Propulsion is steady but cumulative figurative load dulls immediacy. Apply −0.8 for density without coherent pattern and template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "pendulum," "perpetual motion engine of stone and sorrow," "cosmic absurdity," "dangerous potential of rupture," "waterfalls of logic" cluster in adjacent sentences, some mixing vehicles (sorrow has no engine, rupture has no potential). Template cadence in early paragraphs: "She had counted...she would whisper...She could still feel...She stopped...She withdrew" runs identical stems. Paraphrase loop: "the staircase was infinite not merely in its architectural length, but in her psychological refusal to descend" restates the prior paragraph's trap without new pressure. Information density is high in the dice and proof beats, but figurative muddle and scaffold in the climb/reflection sections dull propulsion. Closure image ("gritty, golden, impossible texture") is vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sodium streetlamps drowning in industrial haze," "turmeric in warm milk," "pollen in the greenhouse air"), but the concentration borders on overwriting in a ritualized scene that spans three hours with little variance in cadence. Minor template stems: "She was methodically hopeful," "She closed her eyes," "She painted the word," "She set down." Paraphrase loop: "lost languages were not truly lost; they had transformed" closely echoes the premise stated earlier. Information density is strong; no major loops or muddle, but the lyric texture flattens momentum across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is competent but exhibits repetitive scaffolding: "She lifted," "She descended," "She gathered," "She understood," and "She worked" cluster across key beats, creating template cadence (−0.5). Figurative language is dense—"black rivers devouring woven rivers," "rosewater dread," "stories flowed like water breaking through cracks in ice"—and occasionally stacks without clear payoff, though none fully obscures causality. Information density is high, but several phrases paraphrase themselves: "thaw the ice"/"thaw our collective memory" and "dying arts"/"fading" recur without tightening. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language is dense and often striking ("the hunger stone drank the fate," "beam carving a path through dimensions"), but several phrases loop: "neatly inventive" (×2), "slow exhale of low tide" (×2), "bleak exhilaration" (×2), and "latent radiance" (×3 across different constructions). Template cadence appears in repeated "she had [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" stems across high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphor: "hunger stone drank...consuming shadows" conflates drinking and consuming without clarifying the mechanism (−0.4). Clarity holds overall, but synonym churn and recycled stems dull momentum in the final third. Information density is high, but propulsion suffers from paraphrase loops ("reverse-engineered the puzzle" recurs in concept if not exact phrasing). Aggregate penalties for loops and template cadence: −1.0.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and inventive ("broken jaw of the funhouse," "words slipping into her ear like wet silk") but risks overwriting in high-pressure beats where multiple metaphors stack without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "the faces of the dead pressed against the funhouse glass" / "all frozen in her negatives, all waiting" restates rather than advancing. Template cadence runs of "she had [past perfect]" structures flatten rhythm in the backstory paragraph. No major causality breaks, but density occasionally obscures rather than sharpens momentum, particularly in the confession paragraph where abstraction ("raw honesty of her self-betrayal") summarizes instead of showing the mechanism. Information density is high but not always purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "sketched resonance," "fractal generating waves," "Russian dolls carved from resonance" layer metaphor on metaphor without always clarifying. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "restless euphony—nights when the music...made sleep impossible and creation inevitable" and later "restless euphony of the tide" recycle the phrase without reweighting. Stock constructions appear ("motivation burned with singular intensity," "eager eyes"). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The storm," "The prophet," "She." Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but some ("carrying its instrument-maker toward the next blue hour, the next storm, the next song") churn synonyms. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high (turtles as recording devices, Fibonacci whistle tones, pattern languages) and sentence-level propulsion is strong through the climax. Minor figurative density in the opening ("sunwashed dread," "spiral architecture," "bleached sky") stays coherent and voice-motivated. A paraphrase near the end—"whether to map the journey or become part of it" closely restates the transcendence question already dramatized—triggers a small loop penalty. One template stem appears ("she had discovered," "she had begun to understand") but doesn't form a sustained run. No significant register drift or mixed metaphors; clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, discovery, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally across the piece. Two friction points lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in "she would publish, but frame... / The illuminated letter would go... / The station itself would become..." which restates the decision's components across three consecutive sentences without added pressure, and (2) stock metaphor "ladder strong enough for others to climb out of the darkness" in a closure-adjacent beat. Figurative language (rosebush as grave of conscience, ivy as living architecture) is coherent and purposeful elsewhere. No grammar errors; pronoun references clear.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the hushed blaze of her concentration," "invisible architecture of human longing," "tapestry of what was lost and what endures." Figurative density in most sentences flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("The surveyor empties water" / "Elara walks toward her truck"). Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" sentence openings. Mixed metaphor: the building "slowly kneeling, as if in penance" after being described as "ribs of some beached leviathan." Line-level artifacts dull the closure image and trigger disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from template cadence in the middle section: multiple sentences begin "Elias [verb]" or "He [verb]" without purposeful variation. Certain phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") recur as ornamental labels rather than being dramatized through action. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story density dips into paraphrase loops (the "alternative hypothesis" is stated, then restated as "crystallized into certainty"). No major causality breaks, but momentum sags slightly under repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and anchors spatial choreography, but suffers from pervasive overwriting and figurative density that dulls momentum. High-pressure beats deploy stacked metaphors ("architecture of mourning," "luminous torment made manifest," "spiral staircase of consciousness") without respite, violating the density penalty (−0.5). Synonym churn and template cadence appear in parallel constructions ("descending while ascending," "burial and a birth," "folding, transforming") across adjacent lines (−0.4). The final third doubles down on abstract elevation ("dispersed into the atmosphere," "diving into the heart of light") that obscures the concrete closure action, triggering the artifact-in-closure penalty (−0.5 additional). Information density is moderate; many sentences perform thematic echo rather than advancing choice or situation. The opening and garden-transition beats are sharper, but the closure paragraph collapses under metaphor weight.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries heavy conceptual redundancy: "unused potential," "probability waves," "quantum reservoir," and "intangibly tangible" are paraphrased across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mid-section (geode pulsed, geode warmed, geode fractured). Figurative language is dense but often restates the same idea (futures as "probability waves," "vibrating strings," "quantum foam") without propulsion. The final paragraph loops "intangibly tangible" for the third time, dulling rather than charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings show diversity, but density suffers from ornamental phrasing: "patient stars above that had waited centuries," "forgotten history of a lost civilization," "the universe's white noise into poetry and human presence." Paraphrase loops appear—"missing pieces" recurs conceptually across multiple sentences without added pressure. Mixed metaphors emerge: "the universe's white noise into poetry and human presence" conflates sonic, literary, and existential registers. Filter verbs ("began to pulse," "felt them resonate") dull immediacy in the climax. Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Propulsion stalls in the final third as exposition about frequencies and belonging replaces scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout with mixed success: "sky bruised into night," "sieved hush," "tempered regret," "specific gravity" cluster in rapid succession and occasionally compete for attention rather than layering cleanly. Two instances of paraphrase: "He could not quell the past—could not undo the forged certificates" restates in immediate succession. Sentence openings vary well and information density is strong. The watch hand "seemed to pulse" and "somehow accusing" hedge with filter verbs where directness would sharpen. No major loops or template cadence, but the metaphor load in the final third slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is deliberate and atmospheric, supporting the ritual tone, but syntactic patterns repeat: many sentences open with "The [noun] [verb]" or use stacked modifiers ("storm-worn windblown," "careful architecture of peace"). The phrase "recycling mistakes into wisdom" appears twice, once in the opening and once at closure, which charges the final image but also signals template cadence. Figurative language is dense ("lantern that swayed like a pendulum between apology and forgiveness") and occasionally mixed or strained ("mist thickening as if conspiring"). Information density is moderate; several lines paraphrase prior content ("phase of restoration, not retribution" echoes "tides of suspicion toward low ebb"). No major loops or clarity breaks, but propulsion softens in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the opening and closing beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "backlash of regrets" is restated across multiple sentences (lawsuit/license/divorce, then "backlash of his regrets" again); "align heart and action" recurs without added pressure; "merrily melancholic" is claimed twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: several "He [verb]" constructions cluster in the middle third. Figurative density is high throughout—"sodium light…catching," "shark scenting blood," "wet sail," "cracked lantern," "magnetic interference," "flickering faith"—but most cohere and the final image remains clear. Aggregated line-level issues (loops, stem repetition) total approximately −1.0 under the patterned-artifact pack, plus minor filter-verb stacks; these do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but the piece exhibits template-cadence runs in the opening third ("The doctors had promised…but her hands," "Among the sparse belongings…sat a baseball," "She turned the sphere…feeling its") and paraphrase loops around "delicately robust" (ball, construction, strength, glass). Several filter-verb stacks ("she had thought," "she understood," "she recognized") dull immediacy in reflection-heavy beats. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally strained ("smoke signals from a future that might still be changed"). The closure beats are mostly clean, though "terrible weight of feeling" and "jaded wonder remained…but now it was tempered" read as conceptual summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings show variety, and the prose maintains clarity. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff: "cosmic intimacy," "violent becoming," "living frequency," "pure, patient signal," "hands that were now made of starlight and patience" stack metaphors that blur into abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear: "love had always been a kind of violent becoming" restates the reluctance/devotion tension already shown. Template cadence emerges in the metamorphosis sequence with repeated "Elara [verb]" structures. These artifacts accumulate to −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with high information density. Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent (onyx ink pooling like tears, memory spilling like sensation, time crystallizing in hollows). Some overwriting in peak beats: "choking beauty" and "honey in dark comb" appear near each other; the unfastening metaphor cycles through multiple vehicles (corset, clasp, lock) without settling. A few filter-verb stacks ("felt the moment gather," "felt the weight") and minor paraphrase loops ("not to solve the puzzle but to open herself" / "not to retrieve the time but to sanctify its keeping"). The final third remains legible, but density occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion. Rounding and accumulation: baseline 7.3, −0.4 for figurative density and filter stacks touching high-pressure beats = 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without teaching a pattern or varying cadence: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("recycled cathedral," "stitched together from corpses," "sapphire-bright crystal," "spectral patterns," "filament that mended the rift"). In peak beats (the stitching sequence), this becomes overwriting that slows momentum rather than propelling it. Paraphrase loops are present: "shadow work was not about banishing darkness, but stitching it to the light" is restated across multiple sentences. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems. No major grammar or clarity breaks, but information density suffers from ornamental layering. Line-level artifacts in the closure sequence and elevated diction throughout disallow 9+ globally and trigger Q7 penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is extremely high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile—without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Template cadence appears in several adjacent lines: "He placed... watching... The beach vibrated... Elias had spent... He came..." Paraphrase loops recur: paragraphs 8–9 both explain that Elias unknowingly fulfilled prophecies. Register drift into elevated diction ("helical patterns matching the double-helix dance of DNA and constellations") clashes with the immediacy required at peak beats. Mixed metaphors: "vibrant hush" is used as atmosphere, then "whispering hush," then "vibrant hush settling... like a silk blanket"—the vehicle shifts without coherent logic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but suffers from recurrent scaffold and abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear: "cradle of sparks" is defined three times across the piece; "quiet," "silence," and "hush" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence runs in expository beats: "This was…," "She moved…," "Elara…" sentence stems repeat. Stock metaphors ("velvet" silence, "bruised purples," "swallowed the sounds") lack specificity. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence in the opening carries metaphor, blurring clarity. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("seeds of rebellion," "entire mechanism of power," "set the world ablaze") that assert rather than show. Information density is uneven: the sundial mechanics are concrete, but emotional beats remain summary. Apply cumulative artifact penalty −0.8 for loops, template stems, and stock metaphor strings; the issues touch but do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity remains solid through complex world rules (frictionless rocks, topological field, promise-law). Minor overwriting in the opening: "stolen hues of morning" and "collapsed star dust in his skull" are figuratively dense but do not obscure causality. One scaffolding phrase: "The crimson stones marked prime numbers; the blue represented stellar decay; the yellow calculated..." reads slightly list-like but advances plot by teaching the system. Sentence openings vary. Closure image ("stones remained, painted and perfect") is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("stormlit observatory," "rarefied," "cartography of scars," "longitude and latitude of wounds"), which charges the prose but risks ornamental accumulation in non-peak beats. Several phrases loop conceptually: "furiously tranquil" appears twice; "cartography of scars" and "terrain of silences" restate the same idea within close proximity. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-passage sentence stems show template cadence ("She understood now," "She was not hiding," "She placed"). These artifacts don't obscure causality but do dull line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. However, persistent overwriting clutters high-pressure beats: "diplomatically fierce composure," "calculating warmth," "pneumatic precision," "indifferent commentary" stack modifiers without adding clarity. The alignment beat—"the hidden overture to their expedition lay encoded in the angles"—buries the mechanics in abstraction. Two paraphrase loops appear: "questions can become maps" / "turn questions into destinations" and "dignified chaos" / "chaos…was actually dignity in disguise." Template cadence runs in the duel sequence ("Silas lunged… Aldric blocked… then used"). No outright artifacts obscure causality, but density sags under figurative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops undercut momentum: "the library itself was a luminous fracture" is immediately glossed as "creating a sanctuary that defied brutality"; "forge beauty from anarchy" appears three times across the text in near-identical phrasing; "rebuild" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence clusters: "They worked in silence... They began sorting... Together they carried." The closure beat stacks figurative language ("resistance bloomed in the spaces between words") atop prior metaphor without clear propulsion, and the final paragraph front-loads summary ("Tomorrow the guards might burn it all, or Elias might wake as a stranger") that deflates rather than charges the ending image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template runs −0.5, figurative muddle in closure beat −0.4; total baseline within-band penalty −1.5, capped per artifact accumulation guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density in the technical beats (projector alignment, metronome synchronization, Morse decoding). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Two issues lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loops—"flickering compasses" and "strategically creative" are each mentioned three times with slight synonym variation but little added pressure. (2) Some figurative language in peak beats ("the universe itself, a refusal to accept the last page") elevates register without concrete grounding. The phrase "steely longing" appears three times, functioning as a thematic tag rather than evolving image. No major grammar, tense, or coherence breaks detected.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries moderate density with some vivid images (chromatic moss pulsing, roots glowing with bioluminescent code) but also significant scaffold and paraphrase loops. "Empirically whimsical" appears three times across different beats without escalation; "luminous doubt" recurs as a stock phrase rather than evolving in meaning. Sentences like "She understood: she could not force the seed to grow through certainty alone" and "Elara understood that she must work through interpreted dreams" repeat the structure of intellectual summary without propelling action. The opening and middle third carry strong information density, but the final third shifts into summary mode ("she realized," "she had learned") that dulls momentum. Minor template cadence appears in clustered "Elara [verb]" stems across the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates rhythmic control and high information density in many beats, with strong specificity in craft detail (bobbin lace, copper wire, windswept pine, kanji instructions). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The color of unspoken apologies was not in the water itself, but in the space between waves" / "The color of unspoken apologies surrounded her now—not a single hue, but the shifting spectrum"; "rhythmically placid" recurs as template phrase across five appearances without evolving meaning. Figurative language density is high throughout without clear escalation pattern: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (ghost ship, tides, diffuse, compass pointing to moments, etc.), which flattens peaks rather than reserves charge for closure. The final paragraph's "she possessed the compass, the map, and the courage to sail them" lands as summary rather than concrete image. Sentence openings vary well, but the accumulation of similar marine/craft vehicles creates a single-register texture that doesn't modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. One minor artifact: the verb tense inconsistency in the opening line ("she preprocesses" vs. "swept") is a hairline slip. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; the line-level craft supports and elevates the closure image without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences vary in length and structure, creating natural rhythm. Information density is high (each line advances character, setting, or plot). No overwriting or register drift; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose dense but controlled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and voice-motivated; rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs (e.g., the bell's note "rolling down into the valley"). Sentence-level propulsion is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "foggy lucidity" mirrors theme. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and figurative but voice-motivated, with high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold that obscure closure; rhythm varies naturally, though some may find it ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence structure, high information density, and figurative language that is mostly precise and reinforcing rather than showy. Images like “water stains climbing the walls like dark equations” and dust “mapping stress fractures” pull double duty for setting and theme. There is some conceptual repetition (drama vs quiet, scale) and a mild tendency toward abstraction in the latter half, but not enough to drag momentum or clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—many sentences do double duty in building setting, emotion, and theme (e.g., frost as both physical phenomenon and revelation of buried routes). Rhythm varies nicely between long, flowing sentences and tighter beats around key realizations. There is some mild repetition and abstraction—phrases like “purpose in the pauses” and “drifting resonance of connection across time” edge toward purple and could be sharpened. Still, there are no major loops or muddled metaphors, and momentum holds across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—world-building, emotion, and theme—while maintaining clarity and forward motion. Metaphors are generally coherent and rooted in the story’s sensory logic (frost, glass, thermal auroras), and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. However, the prose occasionally veers into near-purple territory and repeats conceptual ground (“rectify the trauma,” “rectifying the injustice of her deafness”) in slightly different phrasings, which softens momentum. Tightening a few over-decorated phrases would likely lift this into a truly elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and purposeful: most sentences do double duty in advancing action and deepening mood or concept. Metaphors are abundant but coherent and controlled, rarely slipping into mixed or overblown territory; images like “the water accepted her ankles…with the gentleness of a sheet being drawn up” are precise and evocative. There is minimal scaffolding, little to no paraphrase looping, and the rhythm carries momentum without becoming monotonous. A high density of figurative language in places nuzzles the edge of lushness, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and information-dense, with imagery (“amplified quiet,” “its voice, stored in its metal like potential energy”) that supports both mood and theme without tipping into purple prose. There is little to no scaffold, redundancy, or clunky syntax, and paragraphing tracks emotional and narrative shifts cleanly. Recurrent phrasing (“amplified quiet,” references to persistence) reads as motif rather than loop. A touch more variation in figurative approach at the end could elevate the prose from excellent to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, mood, and theme. Line-level rhythm varies and the piece reads smoothly despite its conceptual load. However, figurative language is extremely dense—bridges breathing, embers, pollen, circulatory stone, foggy lucidity—bordering on purple in places and occasionally repeating concepts (breath, fog, stored love) without new pressure. This ornamental excess slightly blurs edges that might benefit from sharper, more economical phrasing, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and dense, multi-tasking sentences that often braid setting, theme, and action (“His arms became vectors tracing asymptotic paths toward unreachable boundaries”). The figurative language is mostly controlled and thematically unified (geometry, botany, light), which prevents true metaphor muddle. That said, the prose occasionally verges on purple, with stacked abstractions (“quaking reverie,” “temporal residue,” “eternal, branching logic”) that could be pruned for even greater sharpness and momentum. There are no major clarity or grammatical issues, just a mild over-saturation of high-register imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight and evocative, with strong images that often do double duty (seed-pod fletching as both tool and symbol, chain circle as time and cost). Sentence rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each paragraph advances atmosphere or stakes. A few phrases flirt with purple or near-redundant intensity, but they don’t materially obscure sense or slow momentum. Information density is high and the final sentences land with a clear, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense, often doing double duty for setting and psychology, with generally precise metaphors (“a bell jar holding twelve dead trees and the ghosts of apples that never fell”). There is a high figurative load, but it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and scaffolding/looped phrasing is minimal. Rhythm on the page reads deliberate, with paragraphing that underlines turns (activation of the forge, insertion of the device, final stillness). A few phrases verge on purple or explanatory (“her motivation was singular”), which fractionally reduces the sense of absolute necessity in every line.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, worldbuilding), and the rhythm varies well. Some metaphors are memorable, and syntax is mostly clean and propulsive. There is a slight tendency toward stacked figurative language and elongated similes in already-charged moments, which risks veering into mild purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush yet largely disciplined: metaphors (“fragile grammar of drips and cracks,” “thawing heart”) are apt and thematically aligned, and sentences generally carry multiple loads (setting, theme, character) without redundancy. Rhythm varies nicely, with long sinuous lines balanced by shorter declarative beats (especially in her stage-directions). There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence offers an image or abstraction—which may feel a touch ornate for some editors, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No obvious loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is vivid and generally efficient, layering atmosphere and psychology in most sentences without losing clarity. Some metaphors and abstractions verge on purple or analytic (“hyper-awareness honed to a razor’s edge,” “transformative betrayal”), and there is mild repetition of certain motifs and adjectives, but momentum mostly holds. Sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and action sequencing in the confrontation is clear. The final paragraphs land cleanly without line-level muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but mostly earns its lushness: images are clear, metaphors are internally consistent (“ink dispersing in water,” “prayers fossilized into the limestone”), and there’s minimal obvious looping or scaffolding. Many sentences do double or triple duty—world-building, theme, and character in one stroke—which sustains momentum despite the lyric mode. There is some risk of over-saturation of figurative language, yet clarity and closure remain intact and the final paragraph lands cleanly. Trimming one or two explanatory lines could heighten sharpness, but line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, largely clean grammar, and many lines pulling double duty for atmosphere and concept (“each note played rewrote the frost patterns on the ground into mathematical proofs”). There is some repetition of key terms (“remarkably composed,” “amalgamate,” “looped timelines”) and occasional purple tendencies, but they don’t materially obscure sense. Information density is high without major scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Tightening a few abstract, thesis-like sentences would sharpen momentum and allow the best images to carry more of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence-level craft is mostly strong: varied rhythm, dense but purposeful description, and several striking images (“acoustic memory,” “secrets had no mass”). The prose sometimes approaches the purple—“timeframe after words become unnecessary,” “water answering with truth”—but remains legible and mostly integrated with character and theme. There are no major loops or scaffolding, but the continuity mistake about where the lens physically is at the end dulls the closure image. Tightening a few abstractions and fixing that prop error would bring the line work closer to publishable polish.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and musical, with a high ratio of meaningful images to filler; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and mood simultaneously). Patterns like “blooming withering” and “mended deception” recur with intention, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. At times the metaphor load borders on purple, and some constructions (“the pragmatism of the wisely pragmatic”) feel self-conscious rather than organically voiced. Even so, clarity remains intact, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, information-dense, and purposeful, with evocative images like “consciousness bleeding between temporal layers like ink diffusing through water.” Some stretches verge on purple, stacking metaphors and modifiers (“twilight bled across the tundra in violet and rust,” “glacial winds,” “crystalline roosts”) without always increasing pressure. Nonetheless, there’s little redundancy or scaffolding, and the closure image is clean and undulled. A touch more restraint or contrast in figurative language would lift this to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. Metaphor and imagery are vivid and mostly coherent, and the prose drives steadily toward the closure image without scaffolding or obvious loops. That said, figurative language is nearly constant and at times borders on purple, which slightly blurs sharpness and could fatigue a very demanding editor. Trimming a few metaphoric layers in favor of one or two harder, plainer beats would likely elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and dense, with many sentences doing double or triple duty for character, setting, and theme; rhythm varies well and the final line lands cleanly. Imagery is generally precise (“auroral sorrow,” “woolly stars,” “shed its glaciers like a skin too tight”) and coherent, with few if any mixed metaphors. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which risks saturation and occasionally edges toward over-richness where a plainer line might heighten impact by contrast. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding; the minor deduction is purely for density that could, in places, be trimmed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense yet generally precise, with high information-per-sentence and very few true redundancies; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or thematic charge. Metaphors are mostly coherent and purposeful, though occasionally verge on saturation (ectoplasm, leviathan spine, scales, negative space, tonnage) in a way that risks slight purple-ness but doesn’t blur meaning. Sentence rhythm varies well, and there are no notable scaffolding phrases or synonym loops dragging momentum. The final paragraphs remain clear and potent, so any minor overrichness doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “roots have cracked the masonry in slow, patient violence”). Rhythm is varied and read-aloud friendly, and figurative language is generally coherent and on-theme. There is some repetition of concepts (transformation, decomposition, seasons, silence) that risks slight over-insistence, but it mostly reads as deliberate patterning rather than scaffolding. A touch more pruning of explicit abstractions would sharpen impact, yet line-level control remains strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty with image and psychology (“chords that shifted like water finding cracks in stone”). There are moments of density and near-purple phrasing (“biological suspension,” “slow cellular language”) but they don’t obscure meaning or derail momentum. Repetition of certain conceptual terms (“ordinary magic,” “softly adaptive”) is noticeable yet not egregious. Overall propulsion and clarity are solid, just shy of the razor-edged precision of elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is consistently polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding (“bronze quiet of a world turned sideways,” “sleep without images where archives became churches”). Line-level clarity remains high despite the density, and there are few if any genuine redundancies or scaffolding phrases. However, the near-continuous figurative pressure edges toward purple in places and risks saturation, slightly dulling the impact of peak images like the wall’s mnemonic shudder. A bit more variation in texture—occasional plainer lines to frame the luminous ones—would lift it into the topmost tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for plot and theme (“By directing flow…he had become the current itself”). Repetitions like “directing flow” and musical metaphors read as intentional motifs rather than loops. There is mild risk of over-abstract phrasing in a few lines, but clarity and forward motion remain intact. No major artifacts, redundancies, or figurative muddles interfere with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere, concept, and action (“decorated with silence,” “the texture of unraveled stillness”). Syntax and paragraphing create a steady, ceremonial rhythm that fits the piece and maintains momentum. However, there is some repetition of key abstractions and a tendency to stack conceptual phrases (“quantum hush,” “architecture of belief,” “accountable, articulated quiet”) that occasionally edges toward purple and slightly blurs sharpness. These choices don’t break clarity or closure but keep the line-level craft just short of elite minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing image, theme, and emotion simultaneously). However, figurative density is very high—“silence between notes,” “unheard symphonies,” “spaces between heartbeats,” “upturned hush,” “dawn itself”—creating a mild purple-prose feel and some conceptual redundancy. A few lines restate similar ideas about silence/time/music without adding pressure, slightly dulling momentum. Line-level control is strong overall, but trimming or varying metaphorical intensity would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“that impossible timeframe where a raindrop hung suspended between cloud and puddle”). However, figurative and adjectival density borders on purple—numerous long, clause-heavy sentences stack metaphors and abstractions in ways that occasionally blur impact (“periodically eternal,” “darkening brightness,” “cartography of her own fractured timelines”). Some explanatory phrases (“procedural generation,” “probability matrices calculated from her previous iterations”) read like conceptual scaffolding rather than organically dramatized experience. Rhythm and clarity survive, but a demanding publication would likely ask for line-level tightening and pruning of redundant or over-literal thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, dense with multi-function images (“sliver of captured starlight,” “filament of hush,” “drank like rain after drought”) that advance character and theme. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum, and grammar and sequencing are clean. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with some metaphors echoing similar emotional territory and flirting with purple, which slightly blunts impact and could be pruned for even greater sharpness. There are minor conceptual redundancies around numbness and silence that add a trace of scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, theme) with high information density and largely clean rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent and voice-motivated, so it rarely feels gratuitous despite its richness. A few constructions flirt with abstraction or jargon (“specific gravity of surveillance,” “biosecurity theater”), adding slight heaviness but not true opacity or redundancy. There are no notable loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong sensory images and a good sense of cadence. There is some purple density and stacked metaphor (“trapped butterflies made of sapphire and frost,” “vault of his unprocessed grief,” “architecture of his mind”), and a bit of conceptual redundancy in the closing explanation of theme. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, sentences do multiple jobs, and there are no serious rhythm or scaffold artifacts. Tightening some metaphoric flourishes and trimming explicit explanation would elevate the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is dense, rhythmic, and information-rich, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character all at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically unified around time, texture, and revision, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple muddle. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum feels steady for a lyric piece. At times the density edges toward overload, which may slightly blur moment-to-moment urgency, but it does not materially harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and musical, with many lines doing double duty for image, world-building, and theme (“the world had swallowed its own tongue” is especially sharp). Information flow is clear; actions around the fire, bowl, and playing track without confusion, and paragraphing supports a sense of ritual progression. However, there is some redundancy and mild purple drift—ideas like “magnificent simplicity,” “honor the fragment,” and “beauty in the unfinished” are reiterated with similar wording, slightly dulling momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; trimming a few thesis-like or near-duplicate lines would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and few wasted lines; imagery like “captured sunsets that refused to fade” and “tears of liquid resin” is striking without often tipping into purple. Recurrent phrasing (“professionally thorough,” “half truth”) works as motif more than redundancy, though it edges toward overuse. Syntax varies well, and momentum is maintained despite the lyric texture—explanations are concise and embedded in action. Aside from a minor typo (“subume”), there are no significant line-level artifacts or muddled metaphors that impede clarity, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied syntax, high information density, and many images doing double duty for setting and theme (“bookshelves stood like silent sentinels against the indigo sky”). However, the density of figurative language and abstraction grows toward the end, producing moments of purple and slogan (“every ending symphony a prelude to deeper, more resonant music”) that slightly dull immediacy. There’s minor conceptual redundancy—multiple formulations of the same insight about compassion and profit—which an exacting editor would trim. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and no major artifacts obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally high-caliber, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and few true redundancies. Sentence rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum, and key images (reed sculptures, silver glyphs, bridge) are clear and striking. However, figurative density is consistently high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or ornament—which occasionally blurs focus and risks purple prose. Trimming a few adjectival stacks and slightly tempering metaphor in peak beats would sharpen impact without sacrificing style.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus emotional or conceptual weight). Rhythm varies enough to avoid a mechanical drumbeat, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding phrases. However, figurative density is consistently high—almost every sentence carries a simile, metaphor, or abstracted concept—which risks veering toward purple in spots and slightly muddies immediacy at the climax. Tightening a few stacked images, especially in the midsection, would make the strongest lines stand out more.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (advancing image, interiority, and theme simultaneously). Metaphoric density is high but generally coherent and controlled, with recurring mathematical and preservation motifs rather than scattershot ornamentation. There is minor conceptual repetition (“equations,” “mathematics,” “geometry”) and a few lines border on explanatory, yet momentum and clarity are preserved. No significant loops, muddled metaphors, or mechanical artifacts interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty with atmosphere and character or theme. Imagery is strong but generally controlled—“sapphire hush,” “curled like metallic insects,” and “underwater and holy” are vivid without collapsing into muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every line advances mood, world, or Maya’s project. It verges on lush, but doesn’t tip into purple or obscure clarity, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly efficient yet layered, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Imagery is largely fresh and controlled, with recurring motifs (roots, trellis, storm, leaf) rather than random figurative churn. There is some repetition and slight purple edging—“circuitously sincere” appears twice, and a few lines state insights that images have already earned—but it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. The final paragraph lands cleanly and rhythmically without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, characterization) without redundancy. Images are fresh and coherent, with metaphor (“granite spine,” “strange tubers”) supporting rather than obscuring sense. There’s some high figurative density, but it doesn’t collapse into purple prose or muddle the closure image. The final paragraphs land cleanly without scaffolding or loops, maintaining both clarity and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple functions (world-building, mood, and character at once). Figurative language—“silver laughter,” “bright darkness,” shadows like oil—is rich but generally precise, avoiding mixed metaphors or density overload. There’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; momentum is sustained despite the lyric mode. The main limitation is a mild drift toward abstraction in the closing sentences, which slightly blurs the sharpness of earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and cadence, images are precise, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Recurring phrases (“compile fragments into meaning,” “staggered intervals”) function as motifs rather than mere repetition, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn. A few moments verge on purple or explanatory (“His reactively visionary gift showed him the web of relationships…”) where the prose tells what the images already imply, slightly blunting impact. Overall, momentum holds smoothly for this quiet mode, with no clarity loss or figurative muddle in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid images (“locomotive constructed of forgotten appointments and midnight confessions”) and sentences that often carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, theme). There is some density of metaphor and a few repeated formulations (“analytically artistic,” “trembling certainty”) that nudge the piece toward mild purple prose and conceptual repetition. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, scaffolding is minimal, and momentum generally advances without loops or syntactic monotony. The final beats land cleanly without figurative muddle, supporting a higher-band score despite minor excesses.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid images (“vibration she could feel in her teeth”) and good information density; most sentences do more than one job. There is some tendency toward abstraction and stacked conceptual nouns (“emotional architecture of observation,” “harmonic convergence”) that edge close to purple without quite obscuring clarity. Momentum is maintained without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the ear engaged. The closure beat is clear and not dulled by overwriting, though a touch more concrete texture there could deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition, and the closing cadence is clean. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and aligned with the established imagery of crystals, geometry, and magnetism; it rarely feels muddled. There is some purple coloration and abstraction, yet it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or obscure causality, and the crucial beats (storm peak, shattering, realization) remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, layered metaphor (“like sugar in warm rain,” “oil on dark water”), and good information density—most sentences do double or triple duty. A few lines verge on overwrought or thematically redundant, stacking abstractions where a concrete beat might carry more force. Even so, clarity remains intact, and there are no noticeable loops, cadential templates, or filter-verb stacks that sap momentum. The final paragraphs, in particular, land with a clean, charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is rich, precise, and mostly efficient: images usually do double duty for setting and theme, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythms vary and the sentences read cleanly despite their complexity, with strong verbs and minimal filter-verb clutter. There is some risk of over-saturation—metaphors and elevated descriptors accumulate (“topological puzzle,” “incandescent restraint,” “metallic suspension”), occasionally flirting with purple—but clarity and momentum survive. That density keeps it out of the absolute top band, yet the craft remains clearly publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: rich images (“salt wind eroded the paint in patterns that matched the neural map of their peculiar sight”) compress character, world, and theme efficiently. Information density is high and metaphors are largely coherent and patterned (containers/archives/tides/rust/texture). There is a tendency toward saturation—nearly every sentence is figurative or abstract, with some near-redundant restatements of the same conceptual point, which slightly blunts momentum. Trimming a handful of explicitly explanatory lines would sharpen impact and prevent the prose from edging into ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are striking, sentences are varied, and most lines carry multiple functions (setting, emotion, theme) without bloat. Phrases like “glass that glittered like failed stars” and “question mark made of smoke” feel vivid rather than generic. There is some risk of metaphor density edging toward purple, and a few abstractions (“architecture of understanding”) slightly dilute immediacy, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony drags the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, image-rich, and multi-functional, advancing character and world while maintaining momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically coherent (carnival, water, surgery metaphors); it rarely muddles sense. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding phrases, and the prose reads smoothly aloud with varied cadence. A few lines flirt with purple or cleverness for its own sake (“as if joy could be spreadsheeted”), but they don’t materially obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax, clear progression, and sentences that usually carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Vivid metaphors—the Earth as a “blue marble drowning in black velvet,” the drills as “mechanical predators”—are generally apt and do not tangle. There is a mild risk of purple density in stacked images and abstract nouns (“modern duty,” “expanding empire”), but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. No obvious loops or scaffolding sentences dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most images do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise (“mechanical heartbeat,” “water whispered the damage”) and rarely tips into muddled metaphor or redundancy. There is very mild risk of purple prose in a few stacked descriptors, yet clarity and momentum remain intact, including at the closure beat. No evident loops or scaffolding artifacts impede reading or blunt the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“condensation bloom…in fractal patterns that mirrored…tributary systems”). Figurative language is consistent and coherent, largely rooted in cartography, water, and paper, avoiding mixed or strained metaphors. There’s mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum at this length. I see no notable loops, scaffolding, or grammar slips that undercut the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for atmosphere and world-building without becoming opaque. Figurative language is mostly precise and thematically unified around sound, rhythm, and organic processes; it rarely tips into muddle. There is minor redundancy (“infinitely patient” recurs, and a few explanatory phrases restate already-implied ideas), but it does not significantly slow momentum. The final paragraph in particular is clean and charged, with no artifacts dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, dense with image yet mostly efficient: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and plot, and there is minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn. Rhythm is varied and the syntax is clear even in longer constructions, keeping momentum through both action and reflective beats. A few moments flirt with purple or redundant emphasis (repeated motif words, conceptual phrases like “unsnarl the knot of controls that had trapped them all”) but they don’t materially obscure causality or blunt the ending. The final paragraphs, in particular, land with clean, concrete images (scent of perfume, weight of water) that pay off earlier motifs without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences tend to do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once), and there’s a pleasing rhythmic variety across long, sinuous lines and tighter emphatic ones. Imagery like “convincing the air itself that he belonged” and “the particular dust of abandoned sanctity” feels precise rather than generic. There is a high density of figurative language, but metaphors remain coherent and rarely mix in confusing ways, so momentum holds. A few abstractions (“narrative so complete,” “perfection of motion”) could be sharpened into more concrete images to push it into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most lines carry atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional charge simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-chosen and internally consistent, and the piece avoids paraphrase loops or explanatory scaffolding that would slow momentum. There is some flirtation with purple density (stacked modifiers and metaphors, especially in the opening and closing), which slightly risks saturation in such a short form. Nonetheless, clarity and causal sequence remain intact, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty for setting, theme, and character, and the rhythm suits a ritualistic, accumulative piece. Despite the density of figurative language, clarity of action and stakes is maintained through to the closure image. There is some flirtation with purple prose and conceptual repetition (e.g., reiterations of “hauntingly optimistic,” “broken precedents”), which slightly slows momentum. Still, line-level craft is clearly above-average and does not materially obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many sentences doing triple duty for setting, theme, and character. Rhythm largely holds on a read-aloud test, and there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors or grammatical slips. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and some lines paraphrase prior content (“She did not rush the discovery. / Instead, Elara…”), creating a slight sense of purple saturation and redundancy. Tightening a handful of repeated motifs and trimming one or two highly adorned sentences would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling over-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“amber and regret,” “pinned to their clipboard,” “dreaming of quarters and competition”). Figurative language is dense but generally controlled and legible; there are no major mixed metaphors or redundancy loops that drag momentum. A few lines edge toward purple or conceptual abstraction, but they don’t cloud causality or the closing image. Overall line-level craft is comfortably at or near publication quality.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor choice is mostly precise, and almost every line advances world, character, and concept simultaneously. Phrases like “she did not stitch stars so much as listen to them” and “foolishness was architecture” are memorable and economical. There is a high density of figurative language that occasionally edges toward saturation, which marginally risks reader fatigue in such a short space. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained, scaffolding is minimal, and the final paragraph lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush but mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme). Rhythm varies well; there’s no obvious template cadence or scaffolding, and the closure image is clean. However, figurative language is near-constant across high-pressure beats, occasionally risking purple excess and slight saturation. Trimming a handful of metaphors would sharpen momentum and make the best images land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally coherent, and information density is high with little scaffolding or repetition. Many lines do double or triple duty (e.g., the coral as both object, neural map, and ethical metaphor). There is some risk of purple prose, with a high metaphor-per-line ratio and stacked abstractions (“machinery of trauma”), but clarity at key beats, especially the ending, remains intact. Trimming a few conceptual restatements would sharpen momentum without sacrificing richness.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are specific, metaphors generally coherent, and sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and character. The prose occasionally brushes purple, with dense figurative language in nearly every line, but it remains legible and seldom stalls momentum. There are no obvious redundancy loops or syntactic templates that undercut rhythm. A touch more restraint in a few key beats could heighten impact, but current execution is publishable-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and largely successful: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme) with good rhythm and precise image choice (“physics made intimate,” “a question mark made of earth”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful; the nested metaphors (garden as womb, coin as contract) align with the conceptual arc. There are moments edging toward purple or redundant abstraction (“nested awakenings,” “ocean of her own awakened consciousness”) that slightly dilute impact at this length. Still, clarity and momentum hold, with no serious loops or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually multitask (worldbuilding, tone, character). The figurative language—“frost of authoritarian control,” “hunting for unlicensed neural activity”—is frequent but largely controlled and thematically aligned rather than showy for its own sake. There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; momentum is maintained through most of the piece. A demanding venue might ask for a light trim of metaphoric density in a few spots, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is lush yet mostly economical, with high information density: sentences often do double duty in worldbuilding and emotion (“cataloging the silence that followed the war”). Key metaphors are coherent and extended rather than scattered; repetition is purposeful rather than artifact. There is some mild overwriting in stacked abstractions near the end (“eternal waking dream of photosynthesis,” “architecture of the blossom armistice”), which slightly blurs sharpness. Overall, the craft is publishable at a high level with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is rich, with high information density and many images doing double-duty for world-building and mood. Sentences are generally clear despite the figurative load, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. However, the near-constant metaphorical texture (“foxglove regret,” “tools of frozen moonlight,” “clouds that remembered rain”) occasionally tips toward purple, slightly muting propulsion and differentiations in intensity. For a top-tier venue, a touch more variation in texture and a few strategic cuts would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and a good balance of image and abstraction with almost no scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is rich but mostly precise and thematically aligned (languages as coffins for meaning, ink chiming like crystal). A few phrases flirt with purple or conceptual overloading, yet they do not obscure clarity or momentum. The final image of fingers meeting through the ink well and the languages singing lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative phrasing (“some revolutions happened in fractions of millimeters,” “a conspiracy of kindness that stretched across time”). Sentence rhythms mostly flow well, and there are few outright clarity issues. Yet the density of modifiers, metaphors, and long periodic sentences borders on purple, especially when multiple figurative descriptions stack in quick succession. Occasional conceptual repetition (e.g., variants of compassion, wisdom, moral imagination) could be tightened for sharper momentum and sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control, vivid imagery, and high information density; nearly every sentence pulls weight for character, setting, or theme. Recurring images (dust motes, foxed paper, the meteorite’s warmth) are handled without redundancy, and figurative choices generally remain clear and apt. A few phrases (“blooming withering,” “symphony older than humanity”) flirt with purple but stay grounded by nearby concretes. There are no evident loops, scaffold sentences, or syntactic tics that sap momentum, especially in the closing movement.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: strong verbs, minimal scaffolding, and high information density with most sentences pulling double duty on image and idea. Figurative language is frequent but usually disciplined, with few mixed or strained metaphors, and the final lines reprise earlier motifs effectively. There is mild risk of overload—phrases like “featherly determined” and “storms first began to remember their own names” flirt with purple, and abstraction occasionally piles up. Nonetheless, causality and closure remain clear, and momentum is not significantly dulled by redundancy or looped phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and largely economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character—“darkness pooled like ink” and “the architecture itself remembered how to breathe” are vivid without obscuring sense. There is some repetition of charged phrases (“luminous respite,” “softly ingenious,” “rhythm of belonging”), but it reads as intentional motif rather than looped scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled; it very rarely tips toward purple or mixed metaphor. Line-level momentum holds across the piece, and the final image lands cleanly without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich, with strong noun–verb choices and clean syntax; it’s easy to read aloud and generally clear. That said, figurative density is high across nearly every line, and some metaphors and phrases repeat close variants without adding pressure (“before memory fades,” multiple restatements of cheerful gloom and missing pieces), creating mild paraphrase loops. The uniform lyric register flattens momentum, as sentence rhythm and image-type rarely shift to mark sharper beats. Line-level craft is solid and occasionally striking, but not yet lean or varied enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, dense with information, and pull multiple weights (image, character, and theme at once). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and not so overstacked as to become purple or obscure causality. There are minor abstractions and occasional slightly redundant formulations, yet they don’t meaningfully drag momentum. The final sentences in particular show strong rhythmic and imagistic control.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft often achieves striking imagery and efficient density, e.g., “stars that shimmered like broken glass suspended in ink” and “sanctuary of skin and stardust.” However, the prose edges into purple and repetitive: phrases like “twilight garden under stars,” “obsidian grace,” and “spontaneously anchored” recur, and several sentences restate the same conceptual point (her becoming tide/memory/archive) with new metaphors rather than new information. Figurative language is very frequent in high-pressure beats, sometimes blurring rather than sharpening the emotional stakes. With some pruning and variation, this could rise to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong rhythm, varied syntax, and high information density; many sentences do double duty for setting and theme. The opening and closing images are especially strong, and figurative language is generally apt. There is some purple-leaning abstraction and phrase repetition (“clear complexity,” “noctilucent reckonings”) and a tendency to stack metaphors (crystal lung, prisms, rings, atmospheric ice) that risks saturation. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved and momentum holds for this length; the adornment doesn’t seriously obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong, with many lines doing multiple jobs—“her burns mapping constellations that rivaled the stars” efficiently fuses character, setting, and theme. Syntax and rhythm vary, and the piece largely avoids scaffolding or synonym churn. There is some tendency toward density and repeated celestial/fire metaphors that flirt with overwriting, especially given the story’s length, and a few abstractions (“arithmetic of loss,” “universal language”) veer close to conceptual repetition. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closing images (empty box, marble, dawn) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, with strong images (“stone skipped across still ponds,” “serene upheaval”) and high information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, and there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors or scaffold sentences. There is some conceptual repetition around “equations,” “patterns,” and “possibility” that could be tightened for momentum and variety. Overall, this is publishable-level craft with minor tendencies toward abstraction and mild purple that could be refined further.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally precise and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (“film negative strip…a ghost of color in a gray world”) and good momentum for a reflective piece. There is some phrase-level redundancy (e.g., the full “through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace” construction repeating) and occasional abstract summarizing in place of fresh image. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and grammar/clarity are solid. Line-level craft is above average and readable, though not yet at the ruthless compression of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences carry multiple functions (image, worldbuilding, mood) and the rhythm varies well. Some phrases and constructions are repeated a bit too exactly (“prism parapet after rain,” “perceptively calm”), and there’s mild purple density where metaphor and abstraction stack (“sequence unlocking spatial logic,” “song’s hidden mathematics”) without always adding pressure. Still, clarity remains high and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. The final paragraphs land with clean, legible images, keeping the prose from undermining the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is dense but disciplined: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing setting, theme, and character without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language (e.g., “generations inherited hatred like family heirlooms”) is vivid, coherent, and well-spaced, avoiding purple overload. Recurrent images of celestial dance, flawed architecture, and mixed soil are tightly interwoven and culminate strongly in the final paragraph. Minor repetition of terms like “ritual significance” is motif-leaning rather than an artifact and does not drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished: high information density, controlled metaphor (“cathedral of salt and bone,” “geometry of absence”), and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing character, setting, and theme simultaneously, and the closing lines land cleanly without blur. There is a heavy but largely successful reliance on figurative language; only occasionally does it verge on purple without adding new pressure. Overall, momentum and clarity are maintained despite the lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are generally clean and apt (“crystal bell shattering in reverse,” “snow…erasing footprints”) and the syntactic variety keeps the paragraph-level rhythm alive. There is a heavy concentration of figurative language even in moments that are nominally high-pressure (the time-sensitive unlocking), edging toward over-saturation and slightly blunting urgency. Still, there are no major clarity lapses, loops, or obvious scaffolds; the main cost is a modest sense of purple density rather than functional breakdown.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and multi-functional, generally advancing atmosphere, theme, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise, with few mixed or muddled metaphors. Occasional redundancy (“uncommonly serene” as both opener and closer; multiple explicit mentions of “epiphany”) and near-purple patches slightly blunt momentum in places. Still, clarity is never sacrificed, and the final sentence lands cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, but most metaphors are coherent, multi-tasking (advancing setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously) and rarely feel redundant. Sentence rhythm shows variation, and nearly every line either sharpens atmosphere or deepens the conceptual frame, resulting in high information density. There is some risk of overload—metaphorical language is frequent enough that a few phrases (“blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence”) verge on reprise—but they are used motif-like rather than as unintentional loops. Clarity of action and spatial relations remains intact, including at closure, so the lyricism does not obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and images that often pull double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., the rope as both physical conduit and stored prayers). There is some redundancy in metaphor chains (“each perforation a letter… a note… a breath…”) and a tendency toward stacking figurative phrases where one might suffice, nudging into mild purple prose. Still, syntax is clear, grammar clean, and momentum appropriate for a lyric piece, with very little true scaffolding or template cadence. Trimming a few over-elaborate sentences would elevate this to elite caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined, with strong images that often do double duty (e.g., doors “rusted open like praying hands,” roots “transcend soil by accepting its darkness”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively and sustains momentum despite the interior focus. There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and repeated structures in the thematic lines, but it stops short of true purple overgrowth or metaphor muddle. Overall, line-level craft is high, with good information density and no serious loops or artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with information, images, and thematic work, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. The prose occasionally flirts with purple due to consistently high metaphor density and abstract nouns, but clarity is maintained. Key beats—tile warming, silver pooling, blood mixing—are rendered concretely and memorably. A touch more sparseness in a few places could increase impact, but as-is it’s publishable-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong metaphorical control and few true redundancies; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Phrases like “architecture of compassion laid like trapdoors beneath violence” and “a splinter of metal that knew the mathematics of return” are inventive and memorable. However, figurative density is consistently high, even in peak-pressure beats, which slightly blurs immediacy and risks purple-prose overload. A touch more syntactic and textural variation—especially at the climax—would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing action while reinforcing theme and atmosphere. Metaphor use is frequent but mostly coherent and on-point (e.g., fog with “teeth of ice,” dreams as “smoke made architecture”). There is mild risk of purple prose and repetition around “boundaries” and breath-related imagery, but it does not significantly obscure clarity or dull the ending. A slight tightening—cutting a few near-duplicate phrasings—would likely elevate this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences do multiple jobs, advancing setting, character, and theme at once. Imagery (e.g., “pear branches weaving through Gothic arches like green prayers”) is fresh and controlled, and there’s little in the way of redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines lean toward overt abstraction or essayistic summary, especially around the thematic explanations of vows and breaches, which slightly soften momentum. Overall, though, syntax is varied, clarity is maintained, and the closing image of quartz eyes casting rainbows in the nave is both precise and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is imaginative and often beautiful, with strong rhythmic control and a high information density per sentence; many lines perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and mood at once). There are few true clunkers, and grammar and sequencing are clean. However, figurative density is quite high, and certain phrases (“simply complicated paradox,” “brightened disquiet”) recur or feel slightly mannered, contributing to a faint sense of purple abstraction in places. Trimming a handful of near-synonymous abstractions and letting a few key images breathe would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and information-dense; many sentences perform dual duty building world and theme. Figurative language is frequent (“temporal wake,” “semantic voids,” “unheard symphony”) but generally coherent and on-concept, avoiding mixed metaphors that break clarity. At times the density borders on purple and risks numbing impact, especially with stacked abstractions, yet core actions remain intelligible and the closure image is clear. Minor repetition (“resourceful as a spider” / “carefully resourceful cadence”) is noticeable but not structurally harmful.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and information), rhythm varies, and there’s little to no scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors generally cohere and reinforce the story’s conceit of narrative as physical medium (threads, pages, ink), and the final images are clean and striking. The density of figurative and abstract language edges toward purple in places, occasionally distancing the reader from visceral feeling. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved and momentum doesn’t stall, which keeps the piece in a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally fluent and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus characterization). There is some repetition of conceptual phrasing (“fables of absence,” “clockwork of causality,” variations on “translate confusion into clarity”) and a tendency toward long, clause-heavy structures that risk slight monotony. Still, clarity is maintained, figurative language is coherent, and there are few if any genuine scaffolding or synonym loops. Trimming a handful of overladen sentences would bring this to an even higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and action), with varied syntax and largely clean rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise, and key metaphors (“like ink in water,” “like beaten copper”) are concrete and legible. There is a mild tendency toward density and repetition of certain constructions, but it doesn’t significantly blur causality or slow momentum at this length. With slight tightening of a few stacked descriptors, this would be fully elite.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn, and the rhythm varies to match contemplative versus climactic moments. The figurative density is high, but metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned (glass, threads of light, seeds, silence), so the prose reads rich rather than purple. A few abstractions (“syntax, a language written in probability,” “coherence wearing a mask”) verge on conceptual rather than sensory, slightly diluting immediacy but not obscuring events or stakes. Overall, the piece moves with clarity and momentum despite being heavily textured.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but mostly economical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“the courtyard floor, formed from translucent quartz that hummed with residual thunder”). Figurative language is dense yet coherent, and repetition (“examining shadow lengths at monuments”) feels like structural motif rather than scaffolding. There are occasional near-overwritten moments where multiple metaphors stack (fog as pearl, sea, wall) but they remain intelligible and do not obscure action or closure. Information flows cleanly from sentence to sentence, maintaining momentum in a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid, multi-tasking sentences that build atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, and the text avoids obvious loops or scaffolding. There is some tendency toward abstraction and repeated coinages (“filtering,” “ambient awareness,” “gravity of hopelessness”) that could be trimmed or varied for even greater sharpness. Despite the lushness, clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs, and images that usually multitask (e.g., stars as “scattered salt,” water as both literal and temporal measure). The language is dense but generally precise, and most figurative moves are coherent and reinforcing rather than decorative. There is some risk of purple-prose drift and paraphrase (multiple formulations of margins/liminal spaces/time’s “texture”), but it stops short of true repetition or muddle. Momentum holds throughout the reflective mode, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without major redundancy. Invented or paradoxical phrases (“stretching contracted,” “intangibly tangible”) are pattern-taught early and largely remain legible, though they flirt with overuse. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density; cause and effect are clear and the closure image is not obscured. A slight trim of repeated constructions and abstract formulations would sharpen impact but current line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythm is controlled, and most images carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously). Some metaphors verge on purple or overwrought (“dissolve the calcified architecture of regret,” “vaulting hush”), but they do not significantly obscure sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most sentences advance atmosphere or character. The density of figurative language is high yet mostly purposeful, keeping the piece just shy of feeling over-ornamented.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: syntax is mostly clean, images are coherent, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme). There is some density of figurative or elevated phrasing (“fracturing light into impossible geometries that hurt the eyes with their beauty,” “memories surfacing from deep water”) but it is controlled and legible, not purple. The prose occasionally summarizes what the reader can infer (“that was adventure enough for one lifetime”) and relies on a few familiar formulations, modestly reducing sharpness. Still, momentum is preserved, and no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles interfere with clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, emotion, and theme (“walls standing like ribs around a hollow heart”). Repetition of phrasing (“loaded emptiness,” “ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight”) mostly functions as motif rather than scaffold. Figurative density is high, and a few metaphors feel conceptual or familiar (burned bridges, learning to swim), slightly diluting impact amid the stronger, more original images. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold, but a light trim of abstraction would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“submarines into origami,” “shadowseam wonder”) and a clear rhythmic sense. There are no major loops or scaffolding; information advances with each line, and the prose generally propels rather than stalls. That said, figurative language is stacked very heavily in places, sometimes layering metaphors on metaphors so that texture risks tipping into mild purple-ness and slightly blurring immediacy. A bit more variance—occasionally plainer, more concrete lines in the highest-pressure moments—would elevate it to truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with many lines doing double duty for mood and world-building (“the room itself seemed complicit in concealment, its walls lined with leather volumes that whispered lies”). However, metaphor density is very high, veering toward purple in places and occasionally stacking abstractions (“frequency of confession,” “bridge of intuition spanning the chasm between living memory and forgotten history”) that risk blurring rather than sharpening the moment. There’s some conceptual redundancy around golden/sepia light and silence that could be tightened for greater impact. Still, narrative momentum is mostly preserved, and the closure image is not obscured by the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rich and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and overall clarity holds even under heavy metaphor. However, figurative and adjectival density occasionally edges toward purple (“factually mystical,” “resonance of dreams,” “elemental essence of what-might-be”), risking saturation and slight momentum drag. There is minor conceptual redundancy around possibility/probability imagery that could be tightened. Still, grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image lands clearly despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, dense, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, theme, and character (“her own recent abandonment making these orphaned histories feel like kin rather than casework”). Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and on-theme; the geological/archaeological motifs are sustained without obvious muddle. There is some risk of lushness (“love that outlasted its own utility,” “manila monuments”) yet momentum and clarity remain intact, and overt scaffolding or repetition is minimal. At an elite level, a touch more variation in sentence architecture and a few trims to abstraction would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are often doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme), and there’s minimal outright redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and scene-relevant—the lagoon, light, and obsolete hardware motifs interlock rather than clash. There is some purple edging (“molten gold,” “luminous defiance,” “cosmic apathy”) and abstraction density, especially around thematic statements, which slightly dulls immediacy. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image reads cleanly and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, mostly clean syntax, and metaphors that are coherent with the established physics and imagery of mist, sound, and light. The prose often does double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and mood (e.g., dew as both physical hazard and code-fragment). There is some near-looping and term repetition (“through negative space,” “vested hush,” “quietly vivid”) that slightly dulls the edge and edges toward purple in places. Still, momentum remains intact and the closure image is crisp rather than obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and aligned with the organic, arboreal register; the metaphors are extended rather than piled arbitrarily. A few phrases flirt with purple or repetition of concept (“monument and monument-builder,” reiterating transformation) but do not materially slow momentum or blur the closure image. Minor tightening of modifiers and occasional restatements would elevate this to truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned with mechanisms, time, and pattern, avoiding purple excess. The prose sustains momentum even while being lush, and action order is clear, particularly in the staircase descent and stone-crossing. Minor risk of over-ornamentation never significantly obscures sense or dulls the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often striking—“liquid mirror,” “regret made luminous,” “the precise gravity that names exerted upon identity”—and carries high information density. Most metaphors are coherent with the story’s physics/metaphysics, and sentences usually do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, theme) at once. There is some purple and conceptual repetition (laws, balance, limits, kintsugi) and a tilt toward abstraction that occasionally mutes immediacy of action. Still, there are no major loops or muddles; rhythm and clarity hold, even if a lighter touch in places would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and largely effective metaphors (wrong notes as smoke, laughter as tapestry, teeth as metronome). Rhythm is varied, and there is minimal scaffold or repetition that doesn’t earn its keep. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the core sensory axes of sound and light. A few phrases repeat tonal abstractions rather than adding new facets, which slightly blunts peak sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and inventive, often doing multiple jobs per sentence and sustaining a strong sonic texture (“read truth through pain’s geometry, to navigate by the stars of her own damage”). However, figurative language and conceptual framing are nearly constant, creating moments of overload and minor redundancy (“mathematics of…,” “algorithm of…,” “coordinates/trajectory”) that thin momentum. The density occasionally blurs edges between images rather than sharpening them, especially in the middle. Line-level refinement to prune repeats and a few mixed metaphors would elevate it significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are often striking (“smoke that remembers it was once bone”), and most lines do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. The prose flirts with purple in places (“density of infinite presence,” repeated abstractions around “anchors of intuition”) but remains largely coherent and purposeful rather than indulgent. There is little padding or paraphrase looping; momentum is steady despite the reflective density. Minor over-ornamentation in concept-heavy phrases keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm and structure, with high information density and few, if any, redundant scaffolding lines. Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined and thematically coherent (time, weight, dust, machinery), and key images are clear. A couple of metaphors (“dust patterns spiraling like galaxies,” “a helium balloon tugging at her sternum”) are slightly on-the-nose or decorative, nudging toward purple but not enough to impede momentum or sense. Overall, prose propels rather than drags, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are purposeful, dense with information, and most metaphors align cleanly with the established imagery of glass, frost, ink, and clouds. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and rhythm supports the gradual build toward the breaking point. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (“beautiful violence of change,” reiterations of perfection vs. motion), but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closing image. Overall, the prose carries momentum and clarity while sustaining a high descriptive register.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and figurative language that generally runs clean and coherent with the story’s physics and emotional logic. Images of visible time as liquid, cloth muffling “screams of time,” and ornamentation as “pressure valves” all do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, mood) without feeling like decorative excess. The prose does ride close to purple in places, with metaphor stacked densely, but it rarely obscures meaning or momentum, and there are few, if any, paraphrase loops. Some moments could breathe more via contrast—one or two plainer lines in peak beats might sharpen the best images—but the craft easily clears a publishable bar.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: vivid images, varied syntax, and high information density with most sentences doing more than one job. Some metaphor density flirts with purple prose (“sound and time intertwined like lovers in endless dance”; “notes falling like copper shavings”) but stays coherent and pattern-consistent. There is mild conceptual repetition around the covenant and the captured sunrise, yet it doesn’t significantly drag momentum or blur cause/effect. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final paragraphs move with a clear, accelerating rhythm toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied in rhythm, densely informative, and often do double duty for setting, character, and theme. Imagery such as “time accumulated in pools rather than flowing” and stalactites that evaporate into “silver mist” is striking and coherent with the story’s physics-softening premise. There are a few moments of near-purple saturation and abstract phrasing in the final paragraph, but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and purposeful, just shy of the absolute top tier due to occasional overlushness.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and multi-functional sentences that advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. At times the prose flirts with purple—stacked figurative language and repeated key terms create a mild sense of over-insistence rather than deepening—and several thematic phrases recur almost verbatim, which reads as scaffold rather than intentional patterning. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved, rhythm varies, and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. Tightening redundancy and trusting images over thesis-restatements would lift the prose toward elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence-level rhythm and high information density—most lines carry atmosphere, character, and thematic work simultaneously (“water dripping…in a rhythm like the counting of rosary beads”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned (light, glass, shadows, seasonal imagery) rather than mixed or decorative. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; transitions are smooth without over-explaining. Occasionally the density of modifiers approaches lushness that might overwhelm in a longer piece, but at this length it remains controlled and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept. At times the figurative load and abstract nouns (“collective trauma,” “temporal reality,” “truth in tension”) verge on purple and slightly blunt immediacy, but clarity is never lost. There is minimal scaffolding or true repetition; most lines advance mood or stakes. A touch more restraint in key beats could heighten impact, but the line-level craft is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush yet largely controlled, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding, theme, and character. Metaphors generally cohere to the magic/science and memory motifs, and there’s no significant looping or scaffold filler. The main drag is occasional purple abstraction and stacked noun phrases (“structural principle of sustainable community,” “compressed potential of everything abandoned”) that momentarily slow momentum and edge toward didactic exposition, though they don’t obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, images are generally precise, and most metaphors (“the shaving curled…like a translucent question mark”) work hard without redundancy. Information density is high, with very little scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or concept. There is a sustained figurative richness that occasionally brushes against purple—so many metaphors in close succession slightly blunt impact—but clarity and momentum are preserved. No major artifacts or loops mar the closure beat, allowing the final images to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is lush and controlled, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once) and a pleasing rhythmic variety. Some metaphors verge on excess or abstraction—“predators of chaos,” “frequency of unspoken names”—but they rarely obscure basic sense. There is minor repetition of concepts (entropy, inheritance) without fresh inflection that could be tightened for elite venues. Overall the prose is strong, occasionally purple, but not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting and theme. Recurrent phrases (“windblown sanctuary above the clouds,” “after the glue dries,” “credibly curious”) verge on mild redundancy but also function as motifs rather than outright loops. There is little clutter or scaffolding; syntax varies and the final lines land clearly. Slight overinsistence on a few motifs keeps it from the highest band, but line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid metaphors, varied syntax, and a solid sense of rhythm that suits a lyric mode while maintaining clarity and momentum. Many sentences do double duty, advancing image, character, and theme simultaneously. That said, the density of figurative language and abstracted formulations (e.g., stacked reflections about endings, surrender, and power) occasionally borders on purple and repetitive, softening impact where a few plainer beats would sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong imagery and multi-purpose sentences that carry setting, mood, and theme simultaneously. Line-level clarity remains intact despite density, and there are few, if any, true redundancies or syntactic stumbles. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—metaphors of weight, architecture, covenant, light—creating a mild sense of overrichness and uniform cadence. A bit more variation in rhythm and some plainer, more grounded lines at key moments could sharpen impact and reduce the sense of purple at the margins.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is dense and often striking, with many sentences doing multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and theme simultaneously (“rough linen dragged across wet skin, like the space between lightning and thunder compressed into tactile experience”). Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to sustain momentum in a mostly static, contemplative scene. There is some risk of metaphor overload and repetition of similar abstractions around time’s nature, but coherence is maintained and key images remain clear. A light pruning of explicit thesis-lines and a few stacked descriptors would elevate the prose further into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong sensory imagery and an effective rhythmic flow that suits a quiet, meditative story. It does edge toward purple at times—dense modifiers and repeated highly charged phrases (“burnished hush,” “harmonized discord,” “broken things”) risk feeling slightly over-insisted. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and most sentences carry multiple layers of work (setting, mood, theme) without obvious padding or loops. The closing paragraphs maintain momentum and image-density without collapsing into abstraction, keeping the final cadence strong.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, generally concise despite lyricism, and carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and causality) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are mostly apt and thematically aligned (e.g., copper as “universal translator,” cancer with “patient hunger”), and there are no major loops or template cadences. The density of figurative language is high but rarely feels incoherent or purple; momentum holds across the paragraph-long beats. A slightly more selective use of elevated metaphor near the end could sharpen punch further.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Metaphorical language (“preservation itself is a kind of violence,” “chemistry of homecoming”) is mostly sharp and coherent, and there’s little evidence of scaffolding, loops, or filler. Density borders on ornate at times, but it doesn’t significantly impede clarity or momentum given the contemplative pace. The closing paragraphs, in particular, land with clean, uncluttered emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, information-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, mood). Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent, rooted in language, chemistry, and ritual, and it rarely muddies basic sense. There is some risk of overload—almost every line is metaphorically charged—but momentum is maintained and the final sentence lands cleanly. Line-level craft is well above average and close to publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, emotion, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some lines flirt with purple or repetition (e.g., the odd, repeated phrase “intuitively descriptive,” stacked metaphors in close proximity), which feels like visible craft rather than invisible control. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep momentum, and key images (the leaf in wax, Ash listening to grooves) are clear at closure. A light trim of the most abstract formulations would elevate it to truly elite line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many striking images and a good sense of rhythm, and most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). However, figurative language is very dense—nearly every line carries an elaborate metaphor (“minutes dissolved like sugar in acid rain,” “thoughts into taffy-like resistance”), which occasionally blurs rather than sharpens. This accumulation reads as overwriting in places and slightly dulls the impact of the peak beats. Clarity and momentum survive, but a leaner line would better serve the already rich concept.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and rhythm varies, with vivid but mostly coherent imagery. There is some purple-prose risk and density of metaphor (“sky cracked like porcelain,” “breath crystallizing in fractal patterns”) but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or momentum in this short span. Redundancy is low and syntax clear; the piece avoids major scaffolding or synonym loops. A bit more restraint in figurative language under peak beats could sharpen the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is controlled, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without obvious redundancy. Metaphors are ambitious but largely coherent and aligned with the established imagery of light, shadow, and absence. The density of figurative language is high, yet it doesn’t quite tip into muddle or purple because syntax stays clear and actions trace cleanly. Trimming one or two near-synonymous phrases would sharpen momentum, but current line-level craft is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images often do double duty for setting and emotion, and there is little redundant scaffolding. Metaphors are generally fresh and apt, and the prose maintains momentum despite its density. There is some piling-on of figurative language—multiple metaphors in close succession—that edges toward purple in spots and could be pruned for even sharper impact. Nonetheless, clarity survives these flourishes, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, images are mostly clean, and nearly every line carries character, setting, and theme at once. The repetition of motifs (threads, hush, thunder) functions as purposeful pattern rather than paraphrase loop, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundant phrasing. A few constructions verge on density (“the accumulated debris of self-loathing that had accumulated”) and could be tightened slightly, but they do not materially obscure meaning or dull the closing beat. Overall, the prose feels polished and publication-ready with only minor trims needed.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and motion), imagery is controlled, and rhythm alternates between long lyric lines and shorter beats at key turns. The echo/bone/spire metaphors are consistent, with little figurative muddle. There is some density of conceptual phrasing and a few lines that lean toward thematic exposition rather than image-driven progression, slightly dampening momentum in the final third. Still, there are no major loops, artifacts, or syntactic tics that obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, images are largely precise, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, for example). Metaphors are apt and coherent (“reading…like Braille,” “liquid light” suturing history), and there are no major loops or scaffold sentences. The prose occasionally drifts into near-purple density and abstraction (“conjured meaning from the edge of oblivion,” “kintsugi required absolute belief”) that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Nonetheless, momentum remains intact and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences generally carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and theme) without bloating, and the rhythm on the page feels deliberate. Metaphors such as “spider-webbed with cracks” and “frozen lightning” are concrete and effective, even as later abstractions (“temporary eternity,” “permanent impermanence”) edge toward the ornamental. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence templates that drag momentum. The prose is rich but remains mostly on the right side of purple, with closure imagery landing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and multi-tasking, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (heat, sound, scent, pressure), avoiding major mixed-metaphor muddle. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum despite the lyric weight. A slight tendency toward purple intensity in places (“screaming tenderness,” “violence of his own quiet”) keeps this just below elite-magazine minimalism but does not significantly impede clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are precise and reinforcing rather than decorative (e.g., “its bell a wound opening in the dark,” “a lighthouse beam turned backward against the fog”). There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and every paragraph advances either emotional pressure or conceptual stakes. The figurative density flirts with overload but generally stays controlled and legible, with no mixed metaphors or rhythm artifacts that obscure causality or the closure image. A few lines venture into slightly abstract phrasing, yet they don’t materially drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid, precise imagery (“clung to the cliffs like a desperate prayer”; “fractured grace”) and good information density—most sentences do more than one job. Rhythm varies well between long, lyrical lines and shorter emphatic beats, particularly around the incantation and burial. There is some risk of over-richness in stacked abstractions (e.g., “psychological safety,” “collective grief,” “empathic network”) but they stay legible and tied to concrete anchors. I see no significant scaffolding, loops, or metaphor muddle that would drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most carry multiple loads (setting, mood, theme) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (light, fog, memory, stone/salt), avoiding mixed metaphors or opacity. Phrases like “her eccentricities calcifying into ritual” and “investigate…with the intuition of a keeper who understood that truth often hid in negative space” are precise and evocative. There is a slight tendency toward lushness, but it rarely stalls momentum or blurs sense.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, often doing multiple jobs per sentence (worldbuilding, theme, and character at once), and remains largely clear despite its complexity. There are mild tendencies toward purple richness—stacked metaphors and long adjectival strings—that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum, especially under the ticking clock. Syntax and paragraphing are varied enough to avoid monotony, and key beats are not obscured by figurative muddle. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only light tightening rather than structural surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is often beautiful and dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a sky that wept liquid light onto empty crowns,” “lacy menace of mineral deposits threading through the rock”). Rhythm is generally controlled, and despite the length of sentences, action and causality remain clear. However, figurative language is stacked very heavily—nearly every clause carries a metaphor or sensory flourish—so the overall effect edges into purple and occasionally numbs impact. Trimming a few mixed or redundant intensifiers would make the strongest images stand out more and improve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, rhythmically considered, and information-dense, with many images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. The prose walks close to purple—metaphor density is high and nearly every sentence is figurative—but it remains coherent and rarely muddles sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. The same coined terms recur a touch often (“scientifically romantic,” “directed spontaneity”), hinting at pattern rather than redundancy, but still slightly limiting the ceiling for a truly spare, elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often excellent, with strong information density and recurrent images doing multiple jobs (scroll, cabin, grave, wolf). However, figurative language is very frequent and occasionally borders on purple, with several metaphors stacked in close proximity (e.g., ouroboros, tapestry, constellation) that risk saturation. Redundancy is minimal and rhythm is varied, so momentum holds. A slight pruning of abstractions and metaphor density would likely lift this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and often do double duty by advancing both mood and theme. Imagery around fog, glass, water, and metal is precise and generally coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors despite the lyrical density. There is mild over-reliance on certain constructs and repetitions (“through occluded views,” “reading between the lines,” “trembling calm”) and a touch of explicit explanation that slightly dulls momentum. Overall, however, prose quality is high and closure remains sharp and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with varied syntax and high information density—sentences often carry setting, emotion, and concept at once. However, there is a recurring tendency toward ornate phrasing and stacked modifiers that occasionally feel like purple prose (“saturated hush,” “bruised purple light,” “glittering piles of narrative potential”), creating a mild sense of overgrowth. A few adjacent sentences restate similar ideas about hush, pressure, and transformation without adding new pressure. Tightening those redundancies and pruning a handful of metaphors would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, and theme). Figurative language is rich but typically coherent and purposeful (“a pure tone that smelled of rain and rosin” effectively synesthetizes the scene rather than confusing it). There’s no significant repetition, syntactic monotony, or confusion at the line level, and the rhythm modulates well from calm description to ritual climax. The density of metaphors in a few stretches nears saturation, which may slightly blunt impact in a venue expecting extreme rigor, but it doesn’t obscure cause or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmically varied, image-rich, and mostly clear despite its abstraction. Some lines do double duty effectively, such as the dictionary’s “semantic stubbornness” or the silence “like a struck temple bell that never stopped vibrating.” However, there’s frequent figurative stacking and echo (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush,” “spiral arbitration”) that can feel repetitive and verge on purple, with limited new information added. The density doesn’t quite tip into muddle, but a sharper line edit would heighten impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme. Recurrent phrases (“razor edge,” “fjord quiet,” “eminently peculiar”) function as motifs rather than mere repetition. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual reiteration (e.g., multiple restatements of the nature of time and resistance), which slightly slows momentum in a few spots. Overall, though, clarity and propulsion are maintained, with no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and a good ratio of image to abstraction. Some lines verge on purple or redundant metaphor (“a galaxy of blue-green stars breathing in the dark earth”), but the pattern feels deliberate rather than uncontrolled and doesn’t obscure action or causality. There are no obvious loops, scaffold phrases, or mixed metaphors dulling the closure image. Tightening 5–10% of the figurative excess would make the lyricism fully support momentum rather than occasionally decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, often doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “The numbers settled into place like rain finding the grooves in window glass”). Repetition of motifs (mica, clover, water, random scrawls) builds texture rather than padding, and there is little true scaffolding or synonym churn. The main weakness is a mild density of abstractions and explicit thematic phrasing in places, which risks slight overwriting but does not materially obscure clarity or dull the closing image. Overall, the prose carries momentum and precision appropriate to a top-tier literary submission.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double or triple duty in setting, theme, and mood. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (loops, harmonics, electrical shifts), and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, which borders on purple in places and slightly blunts impact through saturation. A touch more rhythmic variation and a few plainer lines for contrast would elevate it into rarefied territory.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly well-controlled and coherent, with memorable images like spores that “tasted of old photographs and forgotten languages.” There is mild risk of over-saturation and abstraction in a few places (“destruction traveled through chains of tiny, adjacent events”), but it doesn’t significantly obscure causality or dull the closure. Trimming one or two concept-heavy lines could sharpen momentum and let the best images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are inventive yet clear, information density is high, and there is little to no scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “ivy… like green fingers grasping yesterday’s departures” or stories accumulating “like freight” are fresh and thematically apt rather than decorative. There is some clustering of abstractions toward the end, but they remain anchored in concrete referents (the stone, the station, voices) and don’t blur sense or momentum. Rhythm varies well across long lyric sentences and shorter emphatic beats, supporting the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) with little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—bark dialects, moss singing, and emotional topographies reinforce each other rather than clash. There is a mild tendency toward purple abstraction (“photosynthesizing hope from light,” “quiet blaze of self-revelation”) that occasionally softens impact, but it does not obscure sense or closure. Rhythm and syntax remain clear and propulsive enough that the lyricism enhances rather than drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, syntax is clean, and most images do at least double duty in building world, mood, and theme. Motifs like “planting the wrong seeds,” “confidently uncertain,” and “strange comfort” recur effectively, though they flirt with redundancy and thematic hammering. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled, with few mixed metaphors; momentum holds despite the lyricism. Some sentences summarize already-implied insight, creating mild scaffolding, but not enough to seriously blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most sentences do at least two jobs (image, emotion, concept) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is generally apt and not over-stacked; rhythms vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There are a few near-parallel constructions and reiterations of the premise (“mapping silence into geometry,” “translation of emptiness into meaning”) that might be tightened, but they function more as motif than padding. Copy-level mechanics are clean, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there’s good rhythmic variation. However, the density of metaphor and high-intensity phrasing (“mineral regret,” “smoke still clung to meaning,” “volcanic tenderness”) accumulates to near-purple in places, with occasional conceptual redundancy where adjacent sentences reiterate the same idea in slightly different poetic language. Some key insights are told rather than dramatized, which dulls momentum in what could be peak beats. It’s strong, but a top-tier magazine would likely ask for pruning and sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally concise, multilayered, and purposeful, with most doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotional tone, or action plus theme). Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors (breath of the universe, auroral sound, golden viscous dreams) stay coherent with the established physics and mood and don’t tangle each other. There is little obvious scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between beats are clean. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the prose sometimes edges toward purple—stacked modifiers and images in close succession—without always tightening pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: imagery is fresh more often than not, and most lines do double duty in building world and character (“calculated spontaneity” in footsteps teaches both Voss and the whisper ethos). Rhythm shifts appropriately between descriptive density and tighter, dialogue-driven beats, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few moments edge toward lushness, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. Overall, the prose shows high control and efficiency without obvious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, sensory-dense, and do multiple jobs at once (setting, theme, and action often overlap). Recurring phrases and images are clearly patterned rather than accidental loops. However, prose occasionally veers toward overwrought—stacked abstractions (“within the edge of a half-spoken secret,” “spiralingly calm insistence”) pile up without always sharpening stakes or image, which slightly slows momentum. Clarity remains intact, but a leaner line in places would increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; phrases like “deep ocean held captive in architecture” and “a field of amplified quiet” are striking and largely coherent. That said, figurative language appears in a high proportion of sentences, edging into purple in places and occasionally rephrasing the same idea (quiet, hush, mist) without adding pressure. A few abstractions (“the earth’s memory and heaven’s indifference”) float above concrete stakes and slightly blur focus. Overall, line-level craft is strong and rhythmic but would benefit from a touch more spareness and variance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences carrying multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme) without collapsing into confusion. Imagery around tides, bone, and thresholds is mostly coherent and well-sustained. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“guarded heart,” “false self,” “freedom,” “vulnerability”) and frequent figurative language that edges toward purple in spots, but it doesn’t materially obscure action or closure. Line-level momentum is generally strong, with only minor density drag rather than true scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: the opening image of turbine shadows as “second hands” sets a high bar the rest mostly maintains, with dense but coherent figurative language. Sentences are purposeful and varied; there is little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn, and information density is high. A few phrases flirt with overrichness but remain legible and thematically apt, never obscuring causality or the closure image. The final sentences land cleanly without rhetorical clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often gorgeous, with strong information density and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, leading to some overload and a few paraphrase loops around dissolving boundaries, silence between syllables, and aesthetic motivation that slightly blunt momentum. Certain phrases (e.g., “lantern-moth hush,” “dissolving the boundary”) recur in ways that feel more like untrimmed echo than intentional patterning. Overall, it’s high-quality line work that could benefit from selective cutting to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is elegant and dense: most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) without obvious padding, and the rhythm suits a lyric, contemplative piece. Sensory language is rich but generally controlled, with only a few slightly on-the-nose or redundant formulations (“innocently cunning,” “perfectly imperfect,” explicit thematic statements) that edge toward abstraction. There are no significant loops, mixed metaphors, or cadence templates that blunt momentum or clarity, and the closure image reads cleanly. A bit more pruning of overt thematic phrasing would lift this closer to elite-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone (“extinct sounds hover in electromagnetic suspension” is concrete, evocative, and thematic at once). Rhythm varies well, and there are few if any outright redundancies or scaffolding lines; action and reflection interleave without stalling momentum. The main drag is a tendency toward repeated phrasings and high-metaphor density—“powerfully gentle,” “texture of connection,” the golden light imagery—which occasionally risks sliding into mild purple or thematic restatement. Even so, clarity holds, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, information-dense, and most images do double thematic and atmospheric duty (e.g., extinct starlight mirroring past grief). The prose occasionally leans into abstraction and conceptual repetition (“genuinely artificial” is unpacked at some length), risking a slight drag on momentum in a few spots. Still, there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final calibration image is clean and affecting rather than muddied. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no technical errors that disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, and theme) with relatively little redundancy, and imagery is precise and thematically aligned. Figurative language is dense but mostly well-controlled—metaphors of code, geometry, and ink form a coherent mesh rather than a muddle. A few phrases flirt with purple or over-explanation, yet they do not significantly slow momentum or obscure sense. Overall propulsion and clarity remain high, and both the opening and closing images feel carefully composed and rhythmically tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, vivid metaphors (“a sound like breaking glass wrapped in silk”), and high information density with minimal scaffolding. The prose occasionally overloads metaphors and abstractions in quick succession, risking purple prose but not quite tipping into confusion. Redundancy is limited; most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) simultaneously. A slightly leaner pass—cutting a few overt thematic labels—would push this closer to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often carry dual loads of worldbuilding and emotional charge without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language (“light surrendered to darkness,” “the library…exhaled”) is controlled and coherent, with images reinforcing an established metaphor system rather than spinning off into mixed metaphors. There are minor redundancies (e.g., “softly deliberate(ly)” appearing more than once) but no real loops or purple-prose overload that slow momentum or blur sense. The final images land cleanly and are not dulled by clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level prose is polished, with strong sensory detail and multi-function sentences that advance mood, character, and theme simultaneously. There is some repetition of motifs and a mild tendency toward lush abstraction (“shimmering stillness,” “fragile convictions,” “reconstructed intention”), but it stops short of purple excess and does not obscure meaning. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum in what is essentially a quiet interior scene. Trimming a few near-synonymous reflections could further tighten an already strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished, syntactically varied, and information-dense, rarely wasting a sentence; images frequently do double duty for atmosphere and theme. The figurative language is frequent but generally precise and non-redundant, and the final cadence (“alphabets, finally legible. Elias spoke the first word.”) offers a strong rhythmic close. There are a few moments of near-purple or strained metaphor (“geological coffee stains,” some piled abstractions around miracles and scars) that risk blur rather than sharpen. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact and momentum is preserved despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense, multi-function sentences that blend setting, theme, and character perception efficiently. Metaphors are mostly coherent and on-theme (architecture, film, bodies, warehouses), and there are few if any syntactic or grammatical slips. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous—“hushed thunder,” “warehouse,” “geometry of redemption”—and occasionally reiterative, edging toward purple and slightly slowing momentum. Some trimming of repeated constructions and explicit labels would sharpen the already compelling line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally dense with information, multitasking atmosphere, emotion, and world-building without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and tonally consistent, and key beats (the laying down, the descent of stardust) are clear and well-framed. There is some mild purple-prose risk and a few near-redundant formulations (variations on stardust, inspiration, and cages) that could be trimmed for even greater impact. Nonetheless, rhythm and clarity hold through the climax, and the final paragraph lands with a clean, memorable image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. The prose occasionally verges on purple, with stacked metaphors and high imagery density in nearly every sentence; this risks slight saturation and could be pared in places for greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact—cause and effect are readable and the closure image is sharp. There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the motifs (clock, dune, archive, seeds) recur with purpose rather than as decorative loops.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and layered metaphors that usually stay coherent within the mechanical-organic register. Phrases like “cathedral of glass branches webbed with fiber-optic moss” and “moss-covered pistons that cushioned his fall” advance both atmosphere and action. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language, but it stops short of obscuring clarity or momentum. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the final cadence (“listening to the wind’s new song”) cleanly echoes earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and psychological insight) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied and pleasing. Figurative language is rich but mostly controlled and coherent, with only minor risk of over-saturation; repetition (e.g., “gently persistent,” “shoreline lullaby”) reads as motif rather than artifact. Syntax stays clear even in complex sentences, and there are no grammatical or sequencing slips. The only restraint on a higher score is occasional proximity to purple prose where simplification could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and dense with information, often doing double duty for setting, mood, and character, as in “notes frozen in time like preserved specimens of joy.” Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful; snow, frost, cobalt, and music metaphors form a clear, controlled palette rather than a mixed grab-bag. There is some risk of overwrite and conceptual repetition in the final third (safety/silence reframed in several similar formulations) that slightly blunts momentum and could be tightened for elite publication. Still, clarity, rhythm, and image choice are consistently above average.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Some figurative language is excellent (columns crumbling into dust “fine as pollen”), but there is a consistent high-intensity texture that borders on overrich and risks numbing impact. A few repetitions (“regally unpretentious”) and stacked modifiers could be pared back for sharper momentum. Still, there are no serious clarity issues, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and high information density with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Concrete details (crystalline drives slotting in, zooxanthellae expelling, gray sediment) carry a lot of thematic and atmospheric weight. The repetition around “periodic/eternal tide” is intentional motif rather than loop, though a couple of abstract phrases near the end feel marginally more expository than necessary. Overall, the prose propels rather than drags and supports the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character, and rhythm generally supports the accumulating hum toward the climax. Figurative language (“thunderous serenity,” “knife’s edge of possibility”) is vivid and mostly controlled, though abstraction creeps in via phrases like “meaning in the mess” and “patterns persisted beyond the chaos of human ambition.” There are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts; information density is high without losing clarity. The piece stops short of truly exceptional compression, but it’s well above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and plot) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically coherent (heat, growth, minerals, light), avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are no noticeable scaffold/loop artifacts or clarity breaks; the prose moves forward with good momentum for such an image-rich piece. A touch more spareness in one or two descriptive clusters might sharpen impact, but as-is it’s well within elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (scene, emotion, theme), metaphors are largely coherent and grounded, and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous lines and sharper clauses, supporting the ebb of tension. Figurative density is high but controlled, with motifs (roots clinging, salt-resistant grafts, the pearl) reused rather than scattered. A few phrases risk slight over-articulation, yet they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished and dense, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing image, theme, and emotion at once). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with standout metaphors like the stone forming a fist and the library as “a circular cage of rotting knowledge.” There is mild risk of overload in places where abstractions pile up (“fragmented reality multiplied, infinite and unbearable”), but clarity and forward motion never quite stall. No significant scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors blunt the closure beat, and the final lines land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are varied and rhythmic, images are often striking, and most lines do double duty advancing atmosphere and concept. There is some purple accumulation and repetition of ideas (time stretching, serenity/anger, the encampment keeping secrets) that could be trimmed without loss, and a few metaphors border on over-explicit or academic. However, clarity remains high; cause and effect are never obscured, and the closing images of evaporation and the wind playing him like a flute land cleanly. The piece feels polished but could benefit from slight compression of explanatory phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is mostly clean, fluent, and image-rich, with few if any true clunkers or syntactic confusions. Several sentences do double duty for setting, mood, and stakes, and paragraphing supports momentum. That said, figurative language and intensifiers are fairly dense (“crystalline suspension,” “contraband truths,” “dizzying quiet,” “theater of their oppression”), veering into mild purple and occasional redundancy of effect. Trimming a few stacked modifiers and repeated metaphors would sharpen impact to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and character. Figurative language (“engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze”) is frequent but generally coherent and thematically aligned rather than muddled. There is some risk of over-richness—many metaphors in close succession—but it stops short of bogging down clarity or momentum. Line-level control is strong enough for elite venues, though trimming a few declarative insights might sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is vivid and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“a dialect of metal he could read with his palms like braille”). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which occasionally blurs rather than sharpens the moment and risks purple saturation. There is some conceptual redundancy around “transliteration” and the mechanics of silence that could be tightened without loss. Rhythm and clarity mostly survive the density, but a touch more variation and restraint would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures, minimal redundancy, and high information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding + character + theme). Several metaphors are striking and apt—the observatory as echo chamber of accusations, the glass floor as lantern, wealth orbiting a void—but figurative language is quite frequent, nudging toward purple in places. A few lines paraphrase or explain what’s already implied (“newsprint heiress and honest woman” feels slightly summative), softening impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image (stepping into the elevator with the future uncharted) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is rich, rhythmic, and information-dense, frequently doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but generally coherent and on-theme (e.g., “time folded in on itself like heavy origami”), and sentence rhythm modulates well with pressure. There is a slight risk of overload in places where metaphors stack quickly, yet clarity and momentum at the closure beat remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty as atmosphere and concept. Metaphors are mostly apt and in-family, supporting the sonic and geometric motifs. There is some purple-leaning accumulation—especially in repeated lilac/lavender/amethyst descriptors and stacked abstractions (“architecture of doubt and the geometry of forgotten names”)—that could be trimmed for sharper momentum. Still, clarity is maintained and the closure image is not muddied by figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Imagery (“tesserae rising like blue birds,” “voice carrying both warmth and winter”) is striking without often tipping into muddle or mixed metaphor. There is some risk of purple in clusters of abstractions, but clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding sentences. The final paragraphs in particular are crisp and well cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but impressively efficient; many lines carry image, worldbuilding, and emotional information simultaneously without obvious redundancy. Figurative language (color-sound synesthesia, harvest/aria metaphors) is frequent but controlled and thematically unified, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. There are no notable scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops, and the final paragraph in particular lands cleanly with a charged, concrete image. Line-level rhythm aligns with the accumulative, musical structure of the scene, supporting momentum rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion; phrases like “fractally precise patterns” and “geography of desperation” are striking. However, figurative density is occasionally high enough to feel slightly overwrought, and a few near-synonymous turns (“fractally precise,” then later “mathematical beauty”) flirt with redundancy. Momentum holds, but trimming a handful of abstract or echoing lines would sharpen impact. Line-level control is strong but not yet at a ruthlessly distilled, top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) with good information density. There is some redundancy and mild purple-leaning (“factually mystical” used twice, several dense metaphor strings) but they don’t muddle meaning or stall momentum. The prose occasionally stacks abstractions (“emotional topography of abandonment and hope”) where a more concrete beat could sharpen impact. Overall, rhythm and clarity hold, though a light tightening of repeated concepts would further elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme while remaining understandable. Metaphors (time as resin, buttons as seeds of wisdom, cliffs as wings) are mostly coherent and extended rather than mixed, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. The prose edges toward lush, but here that lushness is pattern-consistent and paid off in the ending images rather than gratuitous. A slightly sharper modulation in high-stakes beats—allowing one or two plainer, cutting lines—could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence structures, clean syntax, and high information density; most sentences do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus character or theme). The recurring images of mist, snow, and silver hush form a coherent pattern rather than a muddle, and figurative language is mostly apt. There is a mild tilt toward the purple in closing generalizations about courage and repair, but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. I see no significant loops, scaffolding, or technical errors that would need substantive line editing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with information, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“palimpsest promise,” “moisture moved like tea through water”) is mostly precise and thematically aligned, with minimal mixed metaphors. There is some repetition and near-purple phrasing that risks saturation, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image. Overall, the prose feels deliberate and polished enough for a high-tier venue, if a touch ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is often beautiful, with dense images doing double duty for setting and theme, and a generally strong ear for rhythm. Some sentences stack metaphors in ways that flirt with purple prose, but logical clarity is preserved and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. Pacing is steady for a lyric piece; no paragraphs feel like pure summary padding. A touch more concision or variation away from near-constant figurative density could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, often accomplishing setting, emotion, and theme simultaneously. However, there is noticeable repetition of certain constructions and motifs (“pull and release,” “quivering hush,” “wistfully pragmatic”) that occasionally feel like echo rather than escalation. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; a light trim could sharpen impact by cutting some redundancy. Momentum holds, but slight purple flourishes keep this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose often achieves striking, original imagery (cloud-ocean like “frozen lightning,” a library that “wept ink and sang when opened”) and maintains good momentum without major scaffolding or loops. However, figurative density is very high, with repeated phrases (“atomically reflective surface,” “brittle awakening,” explicit mentions of isolation/independence) that sometimes feel over-insisted. A few metaphors lean toward purple or explanatory, slightly dulling the impact of the more precise ones. Line-by-line craft is above average and nearly publishable, but would benefit from selective pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, high information density, and imagery that usually does more than one job (world-building, emotion, and theme at once). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically linked (spirals, architecture, light, water), avoiding mixed metaphors or muddle. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; sentences advance the piece’s emotional and imagistic momentum. A hint of purple (“prismatic quiet,” “inevitably whimsical”) remains controlled enough not to blunt clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (advancing plot while shading atmosphere or character). Figurative language like “dust motes danced…like galaxies” or the station existing in “two places at once” is clear and apt, and doesn’t pile up to the point of muddling action. There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffold or template-cadence artifacts, though a few phrases (“cautiously hopeful,” “power plays”) recur with a slightly expository feel. Overall the prose is polished and propulsive, if not yet razor-honed to the level of absolute minimality and surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and densely packed with information and atmosphere, and key actions (waiting, moving during organ beats, stabbing the gears) remain legible. However, figurative language is nearly continuous—walls as jealous hearts, gears chewing at air, history as crushing weight—creating a slight sense of purple overload in high-pressure beats. There is little outright redundancy or scaffolding, but some metaphors could be pruned to let the strongest ones breathe. The final image is clear despite this density, yet tighter restraint would elevate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with dense but intelligible figurative language (“limestone walls like memory refusing to dissipate,” “abscess of silence”) and good information density per sentence. Some metaphors verge on over-stacked, and a few thematic phrases recur with slight redundancy, nudging the piece toward heaviness. Nonetheless, line-level clarity remains high; causality and emotional beats are never obscured. The final lines land cleanly without syntactic muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and emotion (“inhaling through wet velvet” elegantly conveys both texture and suffocation). Sentence rhythm varies nicely, and there are few if any true scaffolding or looped lines. There is mild over-saturation of metaphors and modifiers (“spongey dread,” “velvet blooms,” bioluminescent mold all stacked), which risks purple prose in places, but clarity never collapses. Overall, line-level craft is strong and nearly publication-ready with only light trimming needed.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and musical, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme, and rhythm that largely supports the accumulating pressure. However, figurative density is very high—metaphor piled on metaphor in nearly every sentence—which occasionally blurs rather than sharpens perception (“pixelated amnesty” plus “chemical soul” plus “negative space of potential,” etc.). There are a few near-ornate formulations that call attention to themselves and risk slowing momentum in what is essentially a single beat of emotional decision. Tightening a handful of metaphors and pruning some abstractions would lift clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and multi-function lines that carry image, character, and theme. A few moments verge on purple or abstract (“dusky harmony,” “geometry of repetition,” “economics of predation”) and thematic phrasing occasionally overlaps conceptually, but momentum largely holds. There are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). There are a few tendencies toward stacked abstractions and slightly purple constructions (“constellation of grief,” “temple was not a place but a process”) that feel familiar rather than freshly earned, and the thematic summary at the end softens the impact. Still, clarity, momentum, and syntactic variety are strong, with minimal redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and musical, with strong information density—individual sentences often carry setting, mood, and thematic hint at once. Metaphor use is frequent but mostly coherent, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding phrases that stall momentum. That said, the line-level texture occasionally veers toward purple, with stacked abstractions (“salt and sorrow,” “frozen core,” “artificial winter”) that risk blurring rather than sharpening an already-rich scene. Rhythm and clarity hold through the climax, but slight over-ornamentation keeps it below elite-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and evocative phrasing (“realities stacked like translucent pages,” “shadows pooled like ink”) that advance mood and worldbuilding. Line-level clarity holds even under figurative pressure, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. However, the metaphor density is consistently high, flirting with purple in places (“purposefully curious energy,” “premature chronology”), which occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary. This lushness doesn’t derail closure but modestly dulls momentum and emotional sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty for setting, mood, and character (“roots…inlaying meaning everywhere”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with only occasional abstraction (“economics of souls”) bordering on decorative. There are no significant loops or scaffolding, and the closure image is clear and charged. The density of metaphor in a few lines flirts with overwriting, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is tight and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme (“metallic ghost of applause,” “hope against geology”). Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent (sound/stone/value), seldom feeling mixed or overwrought. There are no obvious synonym loops or scaffolding; momentum is preserved despite reflective passages. At times the figurative language flirts with purple, but it does not obscure clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rich yet purposeful imagery, high information density, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors (clay tablets to history, seed to consciousness encoding, becoming the bridge) are coherent and thematically aligned. Abstract nouns and conceptual phrasing appear, but they’re balanced with tactile detail (obsidian seed, graphite altar, spores forming cuneiform) and don’t swamp clarity. The prose occasionally edges toward lushness, yet momentum and legibility at the climax remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient: images often do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and syntax is clear without mechanical scaffolding or obvious loops. Figurative language is consistent and non-muddled (tides, smelting, amber, salt), with few strained metaphors. Sentence rhythm is well modulated, allowing longer, poetic lines to coexist with crisper declaratives at structural turns. A demanding editor might trim a few slightly redundant abstractions, but line-level craft is already publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density—most metaphors earn their keep by doing emotional and thematic work as well as description. Despite the lush style, cause-and-effect remains clear, and there is little to no paraphrase looping or filler. A few phrases flirt with purple (“subterranean cathedral of calcite,” “walls between hearts crumbled like salt in rainwater”), contributing to a maximalist texture that might benefit from one or two trims. Even so, the closing image is sharp and legible, not muddied by figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned (water, sediment, instruments, ivy), avoiding mixed metaphors or clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding, little redundancy, and the final lines are sharp and well-weighted. At times the lyricism edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t significantly slow momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is lush and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and world rules (e.g., shelves shimmering seconds after she turns her gaze). However, the density of metaphor and abstract phrasing is nearly continuous, which risks a slightly purple, uniform texture and can blunt momentum. There are no major clarity failures or loops, but a few images feel like ornamental variations on the same aura of wonder. A lighter touch or a few plainer, cutting lines at peak beats would sharpen impact for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, metaphor is generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, and stakes). Phrases like “mulberry jam” and “perforated destiny” feel fresh and purposeful, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundant rephrasing. The main drawback is mild over-saturation of figurative language in early paragraphs, which risks slowing momentum before the conflict fully surfaces. Nonetheless, the climactic beats are clear and not obscured by the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and efficient despite being richly figurative; most sentences do double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors are generally coherent and apt, and there is little in the way of syntactic clutter or explanatory scaffolding. There is some repetition of concepts (static, patterns, aurora-as-souls) and high-density imagery that could be pared slightly for sharper impact, but it does not materially drag momentum or obscure meaning. The final image is clear and strong, with no line-level artifacts dulling its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft shows strong control: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and meaning. The piece does edge into overwriting, with stacked metaphors and repeated motifs (“vineyard hush,” “scalloped” patterning) that risk slight saturation rather than sharpening. Still, there are few if any true loops or scaffolding lines, and the closure image is not obscured by figurative muddle. Tightening a handful of heavily modified phrases would move this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and non-redundant; motifs recur with intention rather than as churn. There are a few near-purple or summarizing constructions (“protected vulnerability,” “welcoming nuance like an old friend returning home”) that slightly blunt the immediacy of the climax. Still, clarity and momentum hold throughout, and there are no notable loops or structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, interiority, and theme—without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is often striking (“starlight pooled like silver milk,” “perfect violence”) and generally coherent. That said, the density of metaphors and abstractions occasionally edges into purple, risking saturation where a plainer line might land harder. Clarity is never truly lost, but a slight paring would give the best images more room to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, grammatical, and often multi-functional, layering worldbuilding, theme, and character in one move. There is some redundancy (“through centuries of layered dust,” “historically reverent”) and a tendency toward purple density, but metaphors remain coherent and legible. Momentum is modest yet appropriate for a lyric piece; the text rarely loops without adding nuance. Minor tightening could heighten impact, but closure images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character), and read smoothly aloud. The repeated motifs (“lingering luminance,” “accommodated impossibilities”) create pattern rather than obvious redundancy. There is some purple-leaning diction and conceptual repetition about automation versus beauty, but it rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum. Trimming a few near-duplicate abstract statements could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and purposeful, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Imagery is rich but coherent, and while the prose approaches purple in places, it maintains clarity and internal logic (the color of middle C as amethyst dust, the ship as “reef of rust and secrets”). There’s little to no scaffolding, paraphrase looping, or mechanical cadence; momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. Minor over-ornamentation in a phrase or two is the only thing keeping this below the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“suspended like an insect in golden resin” is exemplary). Information density is high and generally propulsive; there’s little dead scaffolding. However, some metaphor clusters (static as language, amber as spacetime) are reiterated in slightly different words, edging toward redundancy and mild purple prose. This repetition slightly blurs sharpness and momentum in the middle rather than deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and musical, with strong information density—many sentences simultaneously advance setting, mood, and theme (e.g., dust motes as “microscopic galaxies”). Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent and purposeful; motifs repeat with intent rather than as synonym churn. There is some risk of purple abstraction in a few lines, yet clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image lands cleanly. Line-level control is very strong, just short of the absolute precision and restraint that would push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly lean for its lyricism, and information-dense: nearly every sentence advances character, world, or pressure. Figurative language (“the ocean remembered its name”) is controlled and legible, with no mixed metaphors or muddled images, and there are few to no paraphrase loops. Sentence variety and paragraphing support momentum and emphasis, especially around the counting and striking beats. A slight recurrence of similar descriptors and abstract nouns (devotion, imbalance) keeps it just shy of the most surgically precise line work in elite fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and dense with information, and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. Some metaphors verge on purple or stacked (“valley enters a vacuum where sound forgets to echo”), risking over-saturation, but they don’t materially obscure sense or causality. Overall propulsion is steady for a reflective piece, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is polished, with strong sensory images (“ink dropped in water,” “droplet of morning suspended forever”) and mostly efficient sentences doing multiple jobs. However, figurative density is very high throughout, and the closing paragraphs stack metaphors and aphoristic insights in a way that edges toward purple and slightly blunts momentum. A few ideas are paraphrased in different language (universe as mystery vs. puzzle; logic/intution equivalence) rather than advanced. Overall, the prose is impressive but could use minor pruning and restraint to reach an elite, unshowy clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is fluent, image-rich, and largely efficient, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Some motifs and phrases recur a bit too explicitly (e.g., “soundless echo,” the burden language), risking mild redundancy rather than deepening each time. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and anchored in the scene’s physics and mood. Momentum is maintained throughout; there are no major scaffolding sentences or loops that stall the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies well. Some phrases lean abstract or slightly jargon-ish (“method of complementary opposites,” “attribute manifested”), but they remain legible and mostly in tune with the story’s conceptual register. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and key beats (opening the jar, weeping) land cleanly. There’s minimal redundancy, and the final image is sharp rather than overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is competent and often striking, but leans into overwriting: stacked modifiers and dense figurative language appear in many sentences, sometimes diluting impact. Concepts and phrases recur without adding new pressure (“orthogonal approaches,” “safeguard this space,” “storm-born silence”), creating mild paraphrase loops. Rhythm is generally smooth, but the high abstraction quotient slows momentum and keeps some key beats from landing viscerally. With tighter pruning and more concrete, scene-level turns, this prose could rise to a more rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich, often beautiful, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is a deliberate repetition pattern around “macerate,” “silence,” and sound imagery that mostly reads as motif rather than redundancy, though it borders on saturation in spots. A few metaphors cluster thickly enough to risk purple, but they remain internally consistent and do not obscure causality or the closure image. Line-level craft is strong and nearly submission-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density—many lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once (“books grew from frost-covered branches instead of leaves”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid algorithmic monotony, and figurative language, though frequent, is usually coherent and purposeful rather than mixed. There is some risk of purple density and conceptual repetition (“uncertainty,” “liminal,” “veil of sleep” motifs) that could be trimmed for even sharper impact, but clarity is never truly compromised. No major scaffold, loops, or syntax artifacts blunt the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) and the rhythm varies enough to keep momentum despite a reflective mode. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent, and repetition (“successive approximation,” “stoically sensitive,” “frozen bloom”) is used with intent to reinforce motifs. That said, density of metaphors and abstract nouns occasionally edges toward purple, risking slight blur and diminishing impact, especially when similar images are restated. Trimming a few redundancies would sharpen already excellent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood without obvious scaffolding or loops. Imagery like “the night air serenely electric with potential energy” and “carving meaning into pure silence” is striking yet legible, and technical terms are wielded with assurance. There is some recurrence of favorite constructions and a slight whiff of purple in places, but not enough to slow momentum or obscure causality. Line-level craft is strong, just shy of exceptional rigor under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and figurative language is usually precise and evocative rather than decorative. There is some repetition of key phrases and a tendency toward uniformly heightened imagery, which risks slight purple shading but remains legible and controlled. No major loops or artifacts dull the closure image, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but generally clear, with high information value and layered metaphor that mostly avoids muddle (“like biting down on a live wire wrapped in velvet” is particularly effective). There is some risk of decorative overload, as figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, but momentum and clarity survive and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple loads (world, mood, character) and the opening image of rust blooming “like old blood” is exemplary. Prose rhythm varies well and avoids major scaffolding or repetition loops. There is a mild tendency toward density of figurative language and abstract nouns in the thematic passages (“endless becoming,” “spiritually into the vast wonder”), which edges toward purple but doesn’t obscure meaning. Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained while sustaining a rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms, rich but mostly precise metaphors, and high information density: many sentences carry both atmosphere and character insight. However, figurative language is very frequent (“twilight bled,” “reeling hush,” “trapped moth,” “radioactive with consequence”), occasionally verging on purple and risking saturation. There are mild paraphrase tendencies in reasserting Elena’s intentions near the end rather than trusting the dramatization. Trimming a few intensifiers and redundant metaphors would sharpen impact and lift this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense yet mostly economical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“infinity compressed into cable and code” encapsulates setting, theme, and her internal shift). Metaphors are largely coherent and grounded in the story’s physical logic of pressure, light, and phase; repetition (“crashing hush”) works as motif rather than loop. A few high-register phrases and abstractions in the final paragraph could be pared for even sharper impact, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are syntactically sound, imagery is ambitious, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and interiority. There is, however, a high density of figurative language and multi-clause sentences, especially in the opening and closing thirds, that occasionally edges toward purple and could be trimmed for maximum precision. Some concepts (e.g., “the beauty of broken things,” “womb of ice”) repeat in slightly different guises without adding new pressure. With some tightening of metaphor stacks and minor redundancy, this would reach an elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and motion) with few redundancies and no noticeable scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, consistently drawing from a bone/echo/metal lexicon that reinforces atmosphere and concept. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous despite its lyric density. A handful of abstract phrases (“grammar dissolving like mist”) edge toward summarizing vast stakes, but they do not significantly impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush but mostly disciplined: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and action at once), and figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. Rhythm varies, and there are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding phrases that could be cut without loss. It does flirt with purple in places, yet clarity and momentum remain intact through the climax and closing image, so the density feels earned rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and vivid, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“frequency of growth itself,” “factory of clockwork fruit”). Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically apt, and there is little redundancy or scaffolding. At times the density of figurative language edges toward purple, but it remains legible and supports momentum rather than obscuring causality or the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and vivid but controlled figurative language (“linking absences like constellations,” “the arcade exhaled around him”). Most lines do more than one job—worldbuilding, characterization, and theme often fuse in a single sentence. There is some tendency toward lushness and abstraction in late thematic lines, but it doesn’t obscure clarity or momentum. No significant scaffolding, loops, or metaphor muddle interferes with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong images that often do double duty (sequins as dried scales; mist as “held breath”) and a good sense of momentum despite the lyricism. Sentence variety keeps it from feeling mechanical, and almost every line contributes to mood or arc. There is some repetition of favored constructions and metaphors (“whispering gleam,” “misting hush,” reiterated thematic statements) that edges toward purple and slightly blunts impact. Still, clarity holds throughout and the closure image is crisp and unharmed by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, rich in image, and generally high in information density, with recurring motifs (hyperbolic geometry, scarf, analog vs. digital) doing multiple jobs. There is some repetition in the conceptual register (frequent invocations of hyperbolic/non-Euclidean geometry) that edges toward saturation but doesn’t quite tip into muddle or redundancy. Prose clarity is maintained even with complex metaphors, and there are no obvious mechanical errors or scaffolding artifacts. The density might be a touch high for some readers, but it serves the intended lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush, image-dense, and largely precise: metaphors around light, tides, and absence cohere and rarely contradict one another. Many sentences pull double duty, advancing both atmosphere and emotional stakes, and there’s minimal scaffolding or dead phrasing. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, creating a risk of saturation and slight monotony of texture in moments that might benefit from sharper, plainer beats to vary rhythm. The line-level craft is strong enough for serious venues but just short of the ruthless economy and modulation expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, largely efficient sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood), and minimal redundancy. A few phrases (“hush of cosmic possibility,” “enveloped secrets”) verge on abstraction and are leaned on more than once, and some images flirt with purple without quite tipping over. Overall, the language propels rather than bogs down the scene, and the closing cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, theme, and character, with few if any true redundancies or scaffolding lines. Metaphors are generally precise and coherent, and sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. There is a high density of figurative language that occasionally edges toward lushness, but it doesn’t significantly obscure action or stakes; a touch more austerity at peak beats would lift it into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty (world-building plus mood, or characterization plus stakes). Imagery is rich but not so over-stacked as to become purple; metaphors about geometry, shards, angles, and spirals build a coherent texture rather than a mixed bag. There is minor repetition around the tea-leaf geometry and the backward-walking motif, but it reads as motif rather than scaffolding. Rhythm and clarity hold through the climax, and the final lines land cleanly without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the prose largely maintains clarity despite its density. However, figurative language is packed into a high proportion of sentences (“liquid crystal,” “oil-slick rainbows,” “cathedral of preserved wonder”), creating a slight sense of overload and diminishing the impact of individual images. There are mild redundancies around the veil, mist, and wonder that could be tightened without loss. The piece is strong and publishable with some trimming, but the lushness occasionally verges on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and usually do multiple jobs at once (advancing image, worldbuilding, and emotion together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with a few standout images (silence as sediment, kintsugi-like cracks) that feel earned. The prose edges toward purple in places, and there are occasional near-redundancies around silence/quiet imagery, but they rarely stall momentum or blur sense. Tightening a handful of metaphor-stacked lines would move this closer to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high information density—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Imagery is vivid but largely controlled; while the style is consistently elevated, it stops short of purple and rarely feels redundant. A few lines verge on explanatory abstraction, but they do not significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense but generally clear images (“water had become a card catalog of lost things”) and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, supporting the thematic fabric rather than obscuring it. There are a few spots where abstraction and noun-heavy constructions (“specific gravity of grief,” “beautiful mathematics of surrender”) come close to purple, yet they remain legible and in-character. Momentum holds throughout and the final image of snow settling lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, the imagery is mostly precise, and there’s notable information density without much padding or scaffolding. Metaphor and abstraction are frequent but largely controlled and internally consistent (e.g., “wind chimes made of clockwork and rain,” “mechanical heartbeat thrumming beneath the moss-covered stones”). There are moments that flirt with purple prose and repetition of favored constructions, but they don’t materially obscure sense or slow momentum. The closure image—the sustained note, shifting graffiti, and map—is clear and resonant on the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are information-dense, with strong verbs and integrated imagery, and the rhythm suits a slow, ascending meditation. Metaphoric language (“mechanical flower blooming in illuminated code,” “cathedral of suspended water and ambition”) is rich but mostly coherent and on-theme. There is some risk of purple prose and high abstraction in clustered spots (“geography of hope,” “frozen desolation”) yet it does not obscure sense or closure. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts drag momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, minimal scaffold, and images that do more than one job (e.g., “curator of absences” encapsulates role, mood, and theme). Some metaphors and phrases recur (“spooled wholeness,” void/empty spaces) with a hint of redundancy and purple edging, and the density of figurative language is high. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact and the closing image is sharp rather than muddled. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious venues, just shy of the rarefied tier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but generally efficient, with most sentences doing double duty for setting, character, and theme; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, and the key metaphors (fractal perception, the library as a hollowed heart/ribosomal interior) are consistent rather than mixed. There are no obvious paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences that stall momentum, and action ordering is clear even in descriptive passages. At times the figurative density edges toward lushness that might be pared slightly for breath, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush, with strong rhythm and high information density—many sentences do double duty, advancing both image and concept (“living dance outside to the dead dust beneath her knees”). However, figurative language and modifiers are nearly constant, which edges toward purple in places and slightly blunts momentum in what could be the most taut beats. There are no major clarity issues, loops, or scaffolding phrases; cause and sequence remain legible. Trimming a few stacked descriptors would move this from very good to genuinely elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-by-line craft is polished, with varied sentence rhythm, strong verbs, and multi-purpose images that carry both atmosphere and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but usually apt, and there are few if any true redundancies or scaffolding sentences. Some metaphors (“driftwood nostalgia,” “liquid like silk,” “frozen dance”) cluster into a borderline purple density that gently softens momentum in places. Nevertheless, clarity and propulsion hold, and the closure image lands cleanly in spite of the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images precise, and most carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus emotion, theme plus action). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and extended metaphors (orchard/family, nebula/respite) remain coherent. There is minor redundancy (e.g., reiterating that messages appear on deserted sidewalks at dawn) but not enough to drag momentum. The final paragraphs land cleanly without figurative muddle or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with imagery; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“Beautifully flawed memories poured from the puppet's empty sockets…”). However, figurative language is nearly unrelenting, especially in high-pressure beats, which flirts with purple prose and could be pruned for maximum impact. There is occasional conceptual redundancy around “nested patterns,” “hush of time’s final ripple,” and the universe sleeping that risks slight momentum drag. Clarity remains high, and the closing images land cleanly, but an elite market would likely ask for some tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are generally tight, varied in rhythm, and information-dense—most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, and/or plot). Figurative language and modifiers are frequent but not so stacked as to obscure sense, and causality at the line level remains clear. Phrases like “graceless beauty” and “offhandedly exact” recur with enough purpose to feel like motif rather than scaffolding, though the style approaches purple in places. There are no obvious loops, redundancies, or syntactic artifacts that sap momentum, especially in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with varied sentence structures, strong verbs, and images that often do double duty for setting and theme (foam as both physical pattern and musical notation). Technical language is handled smoothly and integrated into sensory perception instead of reading like info-dump. There is a mild tendency toward repetition of key phrases and conceptual restatement, and a few lines tilt toward purple or overly expository thematic framing. Still, readability, rhythm, and information density remain high, with no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, theme, and character) with few redundancies, and the figurative language is coherent with the story’s metaphoric logic of absence and geometry. There is heavy metaphorical density, but it’s largely pattern-taught and purposeful rather than gratuitous; phrases like “integrated fragmentation” and “negative portrait of human absence” feel thematically anchored. Momentum holds despite lyricism, as each descriptive move either advances her method or deepens the stakes. A touch more variation in texture—perhaps a few plainer, sharper lines at peak pressure—could heighten contrast, but no major artifacts or muddle appear.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every line advances image, atmosphere, or character. Figurative language is rich but coherent, staying within a consistent domain (taste, geology, ice/coral, architecture) that fits the premise. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding, or syntactic tics that sap momentum, and the prose reads cleanly. The only restraint keeping this below the very top band is that the metaphorical load is heavy enough that some editors might want a few plainer beats to sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, sonorous, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and action. There is a tendency toward repetition of conceptual content (her determination, the communities’ isolation, the bridging metaphor) and a steady drumbeat of multi-clause sentences that can feel somewhat uniform. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; the main risk is a touch of purple abstraction rather than outright muddle. Momentum holds, yet a tighter pass could trim a few near-duplicate formulations and sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often striking, with high information density in individual sentences. However, figurative language is stacked in nearly every line—double helices, quantum foam, background radiation, chaparral wildfires—creating a kind of metaphor fog that can obscure rather than sharpen key beats. There are noticeable paraphrase loops and favored phrases (“chaotically precise,” “quaking reverie”) that reappear without adding pressure, contributing to momentum drag. The overall effect is accomplished but overwritten for this length and stakes, limiting clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush but generally disciplined: images like “mist coiled through the entrance like breath from some sleeping beast” or “a lens of compressed air” are vivid without derailing clarity. Information density is high—most sentences pull double duty for worldbuilding and mood—yet the sequence of physical events remains understandable. There is some repetition of terms (“threshold effects,” “latent blaze,” “clandestinely luminous”) and a mild tendency toward abstraction, but it rarely produces genuine confusion or drag. The final cadence is clean and does not suffer from figurative muddle or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and economical for its lyricism, with strong verb choices and a good balance between image and clarity. Metaphors are coherent and sustained (cracks as sheet music, insulator as resonator) without piling into muddle, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, world, or character rather than restating. It skirts purple in a few spots but never enough to obscure action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and many lines doing double duty (worldbuilding and psychology in the same stroke). Images like “iron filings stood like hair on a cat’s back” and the stone splitting to reveal crystal are vivid and legible. That said, figurative language is dense and can blur into purple at times, and a few abstractions about silence, beauty, and covenant repeat conceptually without adding new pressure, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished and often striking: “locks were merely frozen conversations,” “bright wounds in the sky,” and the catalog of silences show high information density. Prose leans toward purple but largely maintains clarity, with most metaphors internally coherent and purpose-driven. There is some conceptual redundancy and over-articulated theme in the later paragraphs, and phrases like “theatrical sincerity” recur without new shading. The overall momentum and readability remain strong enough for an elite venue, if slightly over-ornamented.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery (“smelled of damp earth and distant thunder” is emblematic). The prose often multitasks—advancing action, deepening character, and building atmosphere simultaneously—with few true redundancies. There is some purple edging and lexical awkwardness (“olfactorily sensitive nose,” repeated “journalized”) that feels slightly mannered and could be tightened for elite venues. Still, no figurative muddle or structural artifact meaningfully obscures sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is fluent, rhythmically varied, and densely informative, often doing double duty for setting, mood, and concept (“stone bridges that hovered…like frozen lightning”). Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, creating a strong atmospheric fabric without collapsing into full purple prose. There is some conceptual redundancy around resilience and inheritance, and a few lines slide toward exposition rather than scene, which slightly slows momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong and readable, with only minor tightening needed for top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language (“geometry of tragedy,” “manufactured canyon”) is mostly sharp and unified, with only a few moments verging on purple without losing clarity. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or template cadence, and technical terms are integrated smoothly. The prose maintains momentum despite reflective density, keeping the investigative throughline in focus.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that usually pull triple duty for atmosphere, world-building, and theme. Some passages flirt with purple prose and metaphor density (“silence…as a deep violet weight…heavy and smooth as velvet”) but remain coherent and sensorially grounded. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or syntactic templates dulling momentum. A bit more pruning of stacked modifiers could sharpen impact further, especially around peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and often striking, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there are few if any clarity or grammar issues. However, figurative language is dense throughout, and certain phrases (“avalanchingly quiet,” repeated formal constructions like “arranging driftwood as directional markers”) flirt with purple or redundant texture. Some internal restatements of her penance and failure are more expository than necessary, modestly slowing momentum in a short piece. These issues don’t undermine closure clarity but do prevent the line-level craft from feeling fully honed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, precise, and packed with layered information (e.g., “Each font represented a soul: Garamond for the anxious poet…”). The prose edges toward purple, with frequent metaphor and abstraction, but maintains clarity and seldom loops or scaffolds redundantly. Rhythm and variation are good, though the density of figurative language in some high-pressure moments risks saturation and slightly dulls impact. This is near-publishable stylistically, just shy of the utmost refinement needed for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose shows strong control, with concrete images (“aurora rippled overhead like a curtain of ancient silk,” “questions bright as new copper”) and good information density. At times, modifier stacks and thematic paraphrase create mild purple and redundancy, especially in the final third where the same insight is rephrased several times. Still, clarity is rarely in doubt, syntax is clean, and most lines are doing more than one job. Tightening repetition and trimming a few abstractions would bring this closer to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is lush and image-dense but largely precise: “frost ferns,” “sublimate…as if the emotion it carried was too volatile for water,” and the quartz grove’s humming all land cleanly. A few metaphors veer toward aphorism (“truth often wears the mask of falsehood to survive the scrutiny of small minds”), flirting with purple but not enough to cloud meaning. There’s little redundancy or scaffolding; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) at once. Rhythm varies well, keeping momentum despite the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, vivid metaphors, and very few redundant or purely scaffold sentences. Many lines do double work (e.g., “bamboo swayed with the sound of empty sleeves” simultaneously evokes sound, absence, and the central silence motif). There is some metaphor stacking and occasional purple flourishes (“cyclone of copper and gold that smelled of endings and beginnings intertwined”) that could be pared for maximum impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive the lushness, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their length, each advancing atmosphere, character, or worldbuilding without obvious filler, and causality remains fully clear. Figurative language is frequent (“suspended between understanding and confusion,” “like a bridge between what was broken and what might grow again”) but generally apt and not so stacked as to become muddled. There is some rhythmic sameness in clause-heavy constructions and occasional abstraction that could be slightly trimmed, yet momentum never truly stalls. The final images of threads of azure light and silver-green shoots are clean, visual, and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is controlled and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“years measured in breaths” is efficient and striking). There is some tendency toward repetition and conceptual redundancy (reiterated formulations of cycles, weights, and parallel bays) and occasional purple-leaning clusters, but they rarely obscure sense. Information density is generally good, with few true scaffold sentences. These minor excesses, rather than any grammatical or structural errors, are what hold the piece below the very top echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax, strong verbs, and high information density; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and phrases like “that peculiar glow that exists only when light has recently died and memory still burns” risk purple overextension, slightly softening impact. Tightening a few of the most abstracted or lush lines would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from feeling occasionally heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“using the physics of imprisonment to liberate ancient shadows”). Rhythm and sentence variety are strong, and clarity of physical action is preserved despite the metaphorical density. However, figurative language and key terms (e.g., “total internal reflection,” “otherworldly routine,” “accidentally prophetic”) are repeated enough to flirt with over-insistence, and some metaphors verge on purple without adding new pressure. Still, momentum holds and the closure image remains sharp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty (world-building and theme, or emotion and image) and a strong rhythmic ear. Recurring metaphors (dye, light, mist, gravity) are coherent rather than mixed, and the final image of the wing becoming a “star” lands cleanly. There is some risk of purple density—figurative language appears in many sentences, and phrases like “explosive quiet” or “valley-mist wonder” edge toward self-consciousness—but clarity and momentum largely survive. Trimming a few abstracted formulations would heighten impact without sacrificing the lush texture.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and effective figurative language (e.g., the sextant’s “brass legs splayed like a wounded insect,” dreams like “pollen on still water”). Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting a steady, contemplative momentum that suits the piece’s accumulative drive. While the language is lush, it stops short of full purple-prose overload, and there are no significant loops or clarity failures at the climax. Line-level craft could be tightened slightly by trimming a few near-redundant abstractions, but the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and thematic freight simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and there are few if any genuine loops or scaffolding sentences. Some phrases tip toward purple or near-repetition of the bind/weave/swaddle motif, but they do not materially obscure sense or blunt the closure beat. Slight pruning could heighten impact, yet the prose is already operating at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with several memorable lines and images. At times, however, it leans into abstraction and repetition of key motifs (“paradox,” “mistake,” “invitation”) in ways that feel slightly overarticulated, blunting sharpness. A bit more reliance on concrete sensory detail in the peak beats, rather than philosophical phrasing, would heighten immediacy and avoid the faint scent of purple.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, with very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language tends to be fresh and coherent (“hard as ceramic but still smelling faintly of anise and memory”) and supports both atmosphere and theme. There is a lot of metaphorical and descriptive texture, but it rarely tips into purple or obscures clarity. A harsher editor might trim a few abstractions and modifiers to sharpen momentum, yet the prose is clearly publication-ready as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Metaphoric language (“cartographer mapping a sinking continent,” “songs that once made people human”) is apt and vivid, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. The density of figurative description occasionally edges toward purple, with multiple ornate images clustered together, which slightly risks blunting impact in peak beats. Nonetheless, clarity at closure remains intact and momentum is not meaningfully harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory, and usually do multiple jobs (setting, character, and tension) without padding. The prose occasionally skirts repetition of key formulations and leans toward the purple at moments, but these habits don’t obscure sense or slow momentum meaningfully. Rhythm tracks the scene’s pulse, tightening around key beats (winding the fob, feigned drunkenness) and relaxing only briefly. There are no notable scaffolding artifacts, mixed metaphors, or clarity failures in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and generally multi-tasking (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). There is an intentional luxuriance of metaphor and modifier that occasionally edges toward purple—phrases like “architecture of destiny” or stacking “terrestrially cosmic” risks slight vagueness—but clarity remains intact. Repetition is mostly motif rather than loop, with minimal scaffolding or synonym churn. The density might be trimmed slightly for elite venues, but it already reads as high-level, deliberate prose, not undisciplined ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and some excellent images (“bands of auroral sorrow,” “welding her fractured confidence back together”). However, there is a tendency toward purple stacking of modifiers and repeated conceptual phrasing (“uncork her suppressed creativity,” “inescapable calling”) that could be tightened without loss. Sentence-level rhythm leans heavily on long, clause-rich constructions, which slightly dulls momentum in a piece that is otherwise driven by discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: strong, specific nouns (“zinc-etched postal plate fragments,” “condensation catchments”) and mostly lean syntax that carries both worldbuilding and motion. Most sentences do double duty, advancing plot while building atmosphere, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few metaphors (“condensation dripping like tears,” “curling inward like burned paper”) are familiar or slightly on-the-nose yet not enough to muddy sense or momentum. Rhythm varies sufficiently across the piece, and the closing lines land cleanly without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and densely informative, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. There is some risk of purple or abstract phrasing in repeated constructions (“symphonies of truth,” “color of wonder”), but these do not seriously obscure sense or momentum. Scaffolding and redundancy are minimal, and sequence clarity in the mechanism’s operation is strong. The high figurative density is mostly under control, though a slightly leaner line in key beats could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally graceful and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority. The prose sustains vivid images (silver-veined petals, upward roots, iridescent blue-copper flames) without devolving into incoherent metaphor. There is some conceptual repetition around “containing/miniaturizing chaos,” but it reads as purposeful motif more than scaffolding. Syntax and punctuation are clean, and there are no significant loops or artifacts that dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with imagery that carries more than one function (setting, mood, theme). There is a tendency toward repeated sand/silt/sandstorm metaphors and slightly purple constructions that feel a bit overdetermined, though they do not impair comprehension. Scaffolding and paraphrase loops are minimal; nearly every line advances mood, character, or plot. Minor tightening of figurative density in key beats could elevate the prose from strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are largely efficient even when lush, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). Repetition of motifs (spider, web, water, song) is patterned rather than accidental, and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm. There is mild risk of purple-prose density in places and a few near-redundancies (“with the patience of a spider” echoed later almost verbatim), but they don’t seriously obscure clarity or momentum. The prose sustains atmosphere while keeping cause/effect understandable.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally economical despite their lyricism, with high information density and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (“formations that grew like frozen lightning,” “vault for forgotten things”) are vivid and mostly well-chosen, with only an occasional risk of piling imagery a bit thick. The prose sustains momentum and clarity even in descriptive passages, and the final sentence crisply recharges earlier motifs. It’s polished enough for publication, if marginally verge-of-purple in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is lush and mostly controlled, with sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing action while building image and theme. There is some risk of overwriting in stacked abstractions and intensifiers (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze,” “geometric precision”), but coherence is maintained and metaphors rarely contradict or tangle. The momentum is respectable for a lyric piece, though the uniform density of figurative language flattens dynamic range and could be pared for maximal impact. For an elite venue, a touch more austerity and variation in texture would sharpen the already strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“facade pretended stability while the foundation settled into new truths”). Metaphors remain coherent and architecturally grounded; there’s very little padding or paraphrase looping. The risk of purple prose is real but largely avoided through specificity and internal consistency of the conceit. A slight trimming of repeated constructions (“patiently nimble,” for instance) could sharpen momentum even more.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished and musical, with high information density and metaphors that mostly reinforce the core images of quarantine, resonance, and luminescence. Phrases like “tragically radiant display” and “captured starlight drowning in slow motion” are striking and on-theme, and the prose maintains momentum despite being ornate. There is mild overwriting—recurring formulations (“translate isolation into independence,” “tragically radiant”) and stacked modifiers—that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness, but they do not obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong rhythms and high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, and theme). Recurring metaphors (aurora, pearl twilight, stalactite drip) are coherent and reinforce each other rather than clashing. There is a mild tendency toward repetition and lushness that edges close to purple in places, which slightly softens momentum in a few mid-paragraph stretches. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely efficient, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned (stone, sound, rivers, resonance) without slipping into mixed-metaphor muddle. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. A few lines layer images heavily enough to risk slight overrichness, but clarity at the climax and ending remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and musical, with rich images that typically pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the glass flowing “like water to cradle the toy in eternal embrace”). Sentence rhythm varies reasonably well across the piece, and information density is high without major confusion or logical slips. There is some borderline purple layering—reiterated phrases about “salvage,” “truth,” and “purity,” plus multiple metaphors per sentence in places—that could be tightened for impact, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready with minor trims rather than structural overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, information-dense, and multitask (advancing setting, theme, and character together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only occasional risk of purple (“scintillatingly somber,” “invisible cartographies”) that doesn’t obscure meaning. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences that restate information, and the final image is crisp. The high metaphor density might benefit from a touch more spareness under some beats, but momentum is never seriously impaired.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, rhythmic, and efficient; most sentences do more than one job, advancing plot while maintaining atmosphere. Repetition is minimal and functional, with only small echoes (“sharply observant”) that don’t impede momentum. Figurative language is controlled and apt, rarely tipping into purple prose, and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence. A slight tendency toward explanatory density in the midsection keeps it just shy of the most dazzling band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, information-dense, and usually do double duty for worldbuilding and character. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, with few if any mixed metaphors or dead spots. There is some density that could be trimmed for maximal sharpness—they lean into lushness more than necessary for peak venues—but momentum never fully stalls. No notable scaffolding, loops, or syntactic artifacts mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is highly controlled: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Images are mostly sharp and legible (“vibration stained the interior like smoke,” “sweetening the salt air with possibilities”), and the rhythm supports the slow, dawn-tinged turn of the piece. There is some density of figurative language and a few stacked abstractions that verge on purple, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Overall momentum holds well for a lyric piece, with no major loops or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with varied sentence structures, clear sequencing, and vivid, multi-purpose images that advance both atmosphere and action. However, there is noticeable repetition of key terms (vibration/resonance/harmonic) and occasional overpacked sentences that blend multiple metaphors, pushing toward overwriting. A few phrases feel ornate or slightly awkward (“fleshly ethereal nature”), which introduces minor drag in high-pressure beats. Despite these slips, clarity and momentum remain intact, and most lines carry more than one layer of work.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density: most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and emotional tone. Metaphors (“wolves dressed in meditation,” “tectonic lullaby”) are fresh and coherent, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. At times the density of figurative language approaches lushness, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum, and syntax varies enough to avoid a monotonous drumbeat. The line-level craft is strong but not so ruthlessly pared-back or surprising as to feel unmistakably top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology, and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum. Recurrent images—mud, dripping water, rust patterns, vibrations—are clear and not overextended into muddled metaphor. There is little to no paraphrase looping or filler scaffolding; exposition is comparatively tight for the conceptual load. The language edges toward luxuriant in places, but it remains coherent and doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong, with varied syntax and many lines doing double duty for mood and information, and very few outright clumsy constructions. That said, figurative density is high—“vibrant hush,” “violet desperation,” “words falling like hammered notes,” etc.—and sometimes edges toward purple, risking sentimentality and redundancy. A few paraphrase-like reiterations of theme (apology vs. action; second opinions; redemption-as-mechanical) could be tightened. This remains publishable-quality prose with minor trimming, but the ornamental load keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and figurative language that is inventive but mostly precise (“shifting prismatic equations,” “dimensions adjacent to sound”). The prose sustains a lyrical mode without tipping into incoherence or obvious looped phrasing, and the climax is dramatized rather than summarized. A few images verge on saturation, but they remain legible and integrative rather than purple for its own sake. The rhythm supports momentum, especially in the build-up to the bell ringing and the quiet, charged aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: few redundancies, clear syntax, and some efficient compressions of large conceptual moves. There is mild overreliance on elevated abstractions and repeated motifs (“echo of forgotten songs,” “sensed absence”) without always recharging them, but not enough to seriously muddy clarity or momentum. Explanatory passages about the archive’s secret architecture verge on info-dumpy but remain readable. The final lines land cleanly, though trimming a bit of abstract summarizing could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: rich yet mostly controlled imagery, good variation in rhythm, and high information density with minimal dead scaffolding. Figurative language (“roots drinking from mist,” “time fractured at this latitude”) is mostly precise and supports mood and worldbuilding. A few abstractions (“courageous anomaly,” “mapping empathy”) lean conceptual rather than sensory, but they don’t significantly muddy clarity or momentum. The climax remains legible and vivid despite the lyric density, with no major loops or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich but largely disciplined, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“drift-ice clicked and chimed like glass bells,” “the fold in patience had opened into a door, then a window”). Sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The figurative density edges toward purple at moments but rarely muddies sense or slows momentum, and the final image remains clear and sharp. Grammar and sequencing are clean, with no artifacts that blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: “diesel sigh,” “religion she no longer practiced,” and “gentle subtraction” exemplify compressed, evocative phrasing. Sentences mostly carry multiple loads (image, theme, emotion) without obvious scaffolding or loops, and the final cadence is strong. There is some density of metaphor and abstraction that edges toward overwriting in places, but it remains legible and does not blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and generally precise, with strong information density—most sentences do double duty in building world and pressure. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (sound as dust, mechanisms as memory), and clarity of cause/effect is maintained throughout. There are mild repetition patterns and some phrases that verge on purple, but they don’t obscure the closure or bog momentum in this contemplative mode. Tighter pruning in a few lines could heighten impact, yet the overall line-level craft is solidly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is strong line by line: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally avoid redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., grief “settled over the town like soot,” photographs as “living tissue”) is apt and controlled, not overstacked. Momentum is appropriate for a lyric piece; reflection and description keep advancing the emotional situation rather than circling it. A few phrases (“transmute pain into a masterpiece,” “subtle puzzle archivist”) echo workshop diction and slightly blunt the freshness, but they don’t materially harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is consistently vivid and information-dense, often doing triple duty for setting, theme, and character in a single line (“the soft percussion of mushrooms emerging from thesauri”). Sentence rhythms vary and the piece reads smoothly aloud, with strong closing cadence. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous and sometimes borders on excess (“vibrating with the resonance of dew settling on marble”), slightly diluting impact and risking purple overpressure, which keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, dense with information and imagery, and there is little true scaffolding or redundancy given the intentional patterning. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and coherent, with metaphors reinforcing the central conceits of rust, tape, tide, and fog; “the hush of old videotapes left unwatched” and similar phrases earn their repetition. There is a mild risk of purple prose and saturation—nearly every line is figurative—which slightly blurs peaks and valleys of emphasis. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are often doing double duty (worldbuilding and theme), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy; most lines advance either atmosphere or character stakes. The metaphor field is dense—“unrecorded light pressing like water,” “moments expanded like wings,” “luminous ache”—and occasionally risks saturation, but it rarely muddies sense or obscures cause/effect. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth propulsion from physical tremor to metaphysical lift-off without obvious loops. A touch more spareness at a few peak beats could sharpen impact, but the prose remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent, with high information density—most sentences do multiple jobs of setting, mood, and character under pressure. However, metaphor and modifier density is very high (“rain rising upward in defiance of gravity,” “sacred because they were fleeting, because they were now,” etc.), occasionally edging toward purple and risking reader fatigue. There are minor repetitions and near-loops in how stillness, light, and sacredness are described, though they don’t obscure causality or dull the closing image. A light tightening of figurative language would move this toward top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmic, and information-dense; many lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously (e.g., the spoons bending reality and shadows peeling away “like wet skin”). Figurative language is vivid without tipping into muddle, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping that drags momentum. Sentence variety and paragraphing serve the accumulating ritual pressure well. A few abstractions (“released potential,” “recursive loops of spacetime”) could be grounded in more concrete sensory terms, but they don’t significantly harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, dense but generally clear imagery, and good economy—most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors like the cracked porcelain rationalism and the tooth pulsing “like a star” are vivid and thematically integrated rather than decorative. There is some leaning into abstract phrasing (“nostalgic innovation of scents,” “motivation to turn mistakes into constellations”) that slightly blurs immediacy compared to the sharper concrete moments. Overall, there are no serious loops or artifacts, and momentum is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: dense but controlled imagery, multi-functional sentences that carry scene, character, and theme simultaneously, and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Phrases like “mineral tears,” “zephyr bloom of dawn-star light,” and “accumulated silences” are vivid without generally muddling sense. There is a mild risk of purple prose and a high metaphor density, but most vehicles are coherent and thematically aligned, and momentum does not stall. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final image is sharp, not blurred by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, information-dense, and usually do two or three jobs at once (image, theme, and interiority). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and grounded in the concrete setting, avoiding mixed metaphors or true purple excess. There is a touch of repetition around key phrases (“honeyed hush,” composting/translation metaphors), but it functions more as motif than scaffold. A light tightening of a few near-synonymous formulations would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty with image and theme in the same line. However, there is a mild tendency toward lush abstraction and repetition (“inside the whisper of closing pages,” “moving against the current”) that slightly slows momentum without adding new pressure. Figurative language is mostly coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors, but it saturates nearly every sentence, which risks a faint purple sheen. Clarity and cadence remain strong enough that these issues don’t seriously blunt the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong, with dense information per sentence and a good balance of action, image, and interiority; there are few if any true scaffolding or filler lines. However, metaphors are sometimes stacked (“rod of iron wrapped in velvet,” “spun golden stories,” “stitching time back together with narrative and nitrogen”) in ways that risk purple prose and slightly diffuse focus in peak beats. The rhythm holds and clarity remains intact, but occasionally the figurative density feels indulgent relative to the pressure on the page. Minor tightening and pruning of mixed or overly ornate images would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly doing multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character) with few redundancies, and rhythm is consciously controlled. Imagery is vivid and often striking (“photons trapped from the supernova of 1885,” “cathedral of ice and silence”), and the prose remains syntactically clear even when elaborate. There is mild risk of overwriting—metaphors cluster heavily in nearly every sentence and sometimes feel ornamental rather than pressure-bearing—but they do not materially obscure causality or the closure image. Tighter pruning of a few figurative flourishes would likely sharpen momentum without sacrificing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, information-dense, and doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is lush but mostly disciplined; images of wounds, light, and resonance form a coherent motif rather than a muddled pile. There is some repetition of concepts and phrasing (especially the motivation line) that slightly flattens momentum and could be trimmed. Overall, though, the prose reads polished and purposeful, with no errors or artifacts that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, and most images do at least double duty for worldbuilding and theme. There is noticeable metaphor density (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush,” “golden spirals,” “leviathan singing its death song”), which occasionally risks purple-prose saturation but rarely tips into confusion or outright mixed metaphor. Repetition feels motif-driven rather than accidental, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. The main limitation is that the unrelenting lushness slightly flattens momentum and contrast, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, imagery is often striking (“tea leaves that unfurled like waking cats”), and nearly every line advances character, mood, or concept. The prose balances scene and reflection efficiently for this length. That said, figurative language is dense and occasionally self-conscious (“hauntingly practical immortality,” repeated “crystallized time”), flirting with purple in places. Those mild excesses keep it from the very highest band but do not muddy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally efficient, with many lines doing double duty (worldbuilding and emotion). Some metaphors stack (“eroded into something sharper than ambition…sediment, compressed layers of compromise and fear”), approaching purple but remaining intelligible. There are no significant clarity issues, loops, or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite the lyricism. Trimming a few layered abstractions could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme) with generally clean rhythm and minimal scaffold. Concrete images like popcorn kernels, cracked terrazzo, and “fossilized hearts” balance the more conceptual metaphors. Some metaphor density and thematic restatement in the later paragraphs nudge toward slight overwriting, especially around the explicit “equations for hope” discourse. Nonetheless, momentum remains intact and the closure image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is lush, image-rich, and usually clear, with many lines doing double duty for setting and emotion; rhythm generally holds up on a read-aloud test. However, figurative density is high throughout (“glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia,” “crystal whispering forecourt,” etc.), and repeated modifiers like “excruciatingly” tip into mild purple-prose territory. A few phrases restate similar ideas (silence/hush, nostalgia/regret) without adding new pressure. Despite this, momentum and clarity survive; the main cost is occasional heaviness rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant, dense, and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme. There are some repetitions and abstractions (“architecture of lies,” “legend seeker,” “thoughtfully clear”) and occasional meta-summary sentences that verge on over-explanation. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it skirts, without crossing fully into, purple territory. Tightening a few abstract thematic sentences would sharpen momentum and raise the line work into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density: most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus mood, or action plus concept). Metaphors are generally controlled and thematically apt (seeds, fibers, negative space) without collapsing into mixed-image confusion. A few phrases verge on the ornamental, but they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense, and there’s little to no paraphrase looping. The closure image is clear, cleanly phrased, and free of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose shows strong rhythmic control and high information density, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Images like “bleeding ochres and rust” and “the negative space of doorframes she no longer passed through” are vivid and precise. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous and occasionally self-conscious (“a vividly descriptive crimson rush”), nudging the piece toward purple in places and leaving little room for plainer contrast. Trimming a few stacked modifiers or on-the-nose adjectives would sharpen impact without sacrificing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and multi-tasking sentences that carry world, mood, and character. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and imagery (“quaking reverie,” “flawed genesis,” “bitterly sweet,” multiple near-identical mentions of chains and stalactites) that edges toward purple and could be tightened. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; it rarely obstructs clarity. With some pruning of redundancy and a bit more variation in imagery, this would reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and the rhythm modulates between long, lush lines and tighter beats at key moments (“When she emerged into the air twenty minutes later…”). Some metaphoric density borders on overwriting and mild repetition—certain phrases and constructions (e.g., “gracefully alert,” “unyielding compassion,” “migration of clouds”) recur in ways that risk feeling slightly self-conscious. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, there are no true figurative muddles or loops that stall momentum, and the final paragraphs land with clean, potent imagery. With a light trim of redundancy, this would reach the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally lean despite the lyricism, and most metaphors are coherent, original, and multi-functional. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding sentences; almost every line advances atmosphere, premise, or character stance. The density of figurative language is high, and certain constructions (“defiant hush,” “luminous skeptic,” “realistically imaginative”) begin to echo, flirting with self-consciousness. Even so, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme), rhythm varies, and images are coherent within a consistent metaphorical field (gardens, gears, light, petals). Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; it rarely slips into outright purple or mixed metaphors, and momentum through the scene is preserved. There is some conceptual redundancy around generational failure and illumination that could be tightened for maximum impact. No significant artifacts or loops undermine clarity, and the final paragraph lands cleanly as an image and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: the prose is vivid, syntactically varied, and rich in layered images that usually do more than one job. However, figurative density is very high (“sun bled violet,” “trapped moonlight,” “thundering calm,” “voice like distant thunder,” “pressed flower between the pages of a book”), which at times approaches purple and can slightly blunt momentum. There is some conceptual repetition around grief’s shape, thundering calm, and the greenhouse “holding its breath,” which could be trimmed for even greater impact. Clarity and flow remain intact throughout, but a tighter line edit would better match elite-publication rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, precise, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt and internally consistent (e.g., the pendulum as “iron teardrop,” the gears as heartbeat), avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some risk of purple density—phrases like “searing reverie of memory” or “eternal dissonance” push toward melodrama—but they don’t materially obscure causality or dull the closure. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal, and the prose propels rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that is mostly coherent and purposeful. Recurrent phrases (“velveteen gloom,” “tenderly organized,” “shape of intentions”) operate as motifs rather than pure redundancy. The prose does brush up against purple in places, with stacked metaphors and high-flown abstractions that flirt with over-saturation, but clarity and momentum are never seriously compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“ink mixed with crushed glacier sapphire and the distilled essence of questions that had never been asked”). Overall clarity holds, and there’s minimal scaffolding or repetition. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally tipping into purple or self-conscious phrasing that doesn’t always add new nuance (“cartographer of ignorance,” “fish still dreamed”). This density slightly slows momentum and keeps the line craft from feeling fully effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and graceful, often doing multiple jobs at once—world-building, mood, and thematic signaling—in single sentences. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and sensorially grounded, and there are few if any outright mixed metaphors or redundant loops. At times, the metaphor density (“archaeology of breath,” “manuscripts written on spider silk and longing”) risks slight purple-prose saturation, which marginally softens momentum. Overall, though, clarity and cadence hold, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and precise, with many lines doing double work (e.g., cancer “powdered her bones” mirroring his charcoal practice). Rhythm and imagery are strong, and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding sentences. The main limitation is occasional metaphor saturation, where nearly every sentence carries a heavy image, risking slight numbing rather than sharpening, especially mid-piece. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum survive, and the closure image is clean and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but purposeful, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Metaphors (sedimentary layers, concrete leviathan, diamond of truth) largely cohere around geology and machinery, avoiding mixed-image muddle. There is mild risk of over-saturation in places, and a few abstractions could be pared for even greater sharpness and momentum. Nonetheless, clarity, rhythm, and information density remain high without noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Images like resonance “hanging in the velvet air like incense or memory” feel apt and precise. There is some density of abstraction and conceptual repetition (“vanishing arts,” “subtracting noise,” “harmony”) that edges into mild overwriting but doesn’t obscure meaning. Momentum is gently paced yet steady, with little true scaffolding or looped paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with vivid images, good sentence variety, and high information density—most sentences carry world, character, and theme at once. The science-metaphor blend (“neural pathways overgrown with thorny recollections,” “brain literally shedding dendritic weight”) is mostly coherent and evocative. There is some repetition of key terms (“synaptic plasticity,” “informally wise,” pruning metaphors) and occasional abstraction that edges toward telling, but it stops short of true purple prose or scaffoldy loops. Rhythm and clarity hold through the ending, keeping the charged final image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied in rhythm, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. The repeated honey/amber/nectar imagery creates a coherent texture rather than random purple prose, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. That said, figurative language is frequent and occasionally stacked (“truth… flowing like liquid light,” “amber light of nectar dusk bathed… in liquid gold”), which risks over-sweetening and slightly blurring impact in places. Still, clarity at closure remains intact and momentum doesn’t noticeably stall.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and economical, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic seeding) without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and well-chosen, e.g., “a shard of hush, crystallized absence of sound” and “streetlights daydreamed,” which support the story’s metaphysics. There are no visible loops, syntactic monotony, or generation artifacts, and rhythm reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases nudge toward the purple, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level work is lush, image-dense, and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. The rhythm varies well and the closing images (dome breathing, coral singing in major and minor) land cleanly. However, figurative language is nearly constant, and thematic phrases (“welcome nuance into certainty,” “incisively kind”) recur enough to flirt with overstatement and slight redundancy. Trimming a few abstract restatements would sharpen momentum and let the strongest images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-by-line, the prose is dense but purposeful; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character interiority) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm varies nicely between long, spiraling constructions that echo the staircase and shorter, declarative lines that mark turns (“This asymmetry was the key, the glitch in the system.”). A few images flirt with purple or near-redundancy, but they don’t obscure sense or dampen the closure beat. Overall, it reads as highly polished and close to publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, and theme), and metaphorical choices like “saffron quiet” and “broken constellation of sodium streetlamps” feel precise and fresh. Rhythm varies well, and there’s little if any scaffolding or paraphrase-looping; each paragraph advances texture or idea. Figurative density is high but generally coherent and legible, without mixed metaphors or muddled logic. At times the accumulation borders on lushness for its own sake, yet it never seriously obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-by-line, the prose is controlled, with varied syntax and high information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character). Some metaphoric layering edges toward purple (“rosewater dread,” “black rivers devouring woven rivers”) but remains coherent and image-true, not muddled. There are no obvious loops or scaffold sentences, and rhythm modulates well between exposition and climactic declaration. At times a slight excess of modifiers and abstractions (“damp dread,” “collective memory”) could be pruned for even sharper impact, which keeps this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is dense but mostly efficient: sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and concept, with minimal true scaffolding or repetition. Rhythm is varied and the figurative language is largely coherent and motivated by the story’s obsessions (time, light, tide, spinning). Occasional phrases lean abstract or repeat (“bleak exhilaration” appears twice) where fresh, embodied language could sharpen impact. Nonetheless, nothing crucial is obscured, and momentum carries cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, densely informative, and most metaphors are striking yet legible (“breath visible in the lingering luminance…like phosphorescent mold”). The prose often does double duty—advancing plot while reinforcing mood and theme—and avoids obvious scaffolding or redundancy. There is some purple tendency and stacked figurative language (“made of both shadow and the sickly sweet smell of cotton candy rotting in rain”), but it remains coherent rather than muddled. Momentum is maintained across the piece, and the final image lands cleanly without being obscured by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with strong information density—many sentences do double duty for image and concept. However, there is some overwriting and conceptual repetition (“fractal generating,” “restless euphony,” variations on storm-as-music) that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it rarely slips into mixed metaphors, though the sheer density occasionally blurs momentum. Line-level craft is strong but could use a few strategic cuts for clarity and impact at a prestige-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled: images are specific, metaphors coherent, and nearly every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot. There are no obvious scaffolding phrases, synonym loops, or template cadences; the language maintains momentum despite its lyricism. Figurative texture is high but not purple, and key beats (“The sky cracked.”; “They were moving toward the horizon, toward the watchers…”) are delivered with clean, uncluttered force. A tiny trim of modifiers in a couple of sentences could make the peak moments cut even sharper, but line-level craft is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong—rhythmically varied, precise, and capable of layering image, mood, and information in single lines. The opening paragraph in particular is dense but clear, setting atmosphere and stakes efficiently. There are moments of over-rich or abstract phrasing and a few near-redundant thematic formulations that slightly blunt momentum. Still, line-level craft remains above average, with no serious clarity issues or structural artifacts in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with rich imagery that generally does double duty for atmosphere and theme (“fissures that resemble the broken lines of old sheet music”). Sentence variety and paragraphing maintain momentum despite a reflective mode, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. At times the density of metaphor (“haunting textile,” “watery cathedral,” “bones scattering across the harbor floor”) edges toward purple, and a few phrases recur (“hushed blaze,” “wrest”) in ways that could be sharpened or varied. Nonetheless, clarity is never compromised, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) without serious clutter, and causality remains clear despite complexity of phrasing. The prose occasionally pushes into purple or abstract (“reclaimed stillness settle into his chest like silt”), and certain phrases (“tranquilly perceptive,” “dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”) feel like self-conscious motifs rather than lived texture. There’s minor conceptual redundancy but no real loops that stall momentum. With a modest trim of decorative abstraction, this would be publication-ready on the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally beautiful, with high information density—many sentences do triple duty in worldbuilding, emotion, and theme—and the rhythm varies in a way that suits the meditative arc. Recurring phrases like “descending while ascending” and “luminous torment” work as intentional motifs rather than careless repetition, and syntax is clean. There is some tendency toward saturation of figurative language and overt thematic phrasing in the final third, which edges into mild overwriting and could be tightened for greater impact. These issues don’t harm closure clarity but keep the line-level craft from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and syntax is clean and readable throughout. Nonetheless, the density of figurative language and repeated constructions (“intangibly tangible,” “pooled like,” re-explaining unused potential) approaches purple and creates some redundancy. A light line-edit could trim paraphrase loops and sharpen impact without losing the lyricism. These issues don’t obscure closure but keep the piece out of the highest craft band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, grammatically clean, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting and theme. Some metaphors are striking (“map the human heart,” “language written in radio waves,” “brilliant dimness of the fading day”), and repetition motifs are purpose-driven rather than accidental. However, figurative and adjectival density is high nearly everywhere—borderline purple at times—which mildly blurs impact and momentum. A bit more pruning or variation in intensity, especially around the climax, would sharpen the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythms, dense but purposeful imagery, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose often double-loads function, advancing action and theme in the same line (e.g., the carvings aging year by year, the watch hand as both timestamp and accusation). There is some repetition and slight over-saturation of certain motifs (“weight,” “truth,” “silence,” “unspoken words”) that edges toward purple in places, softening impact through familiarity. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and apt; a few metaphors verge on overdetermined symbolism yet do not obscure sense or causality. There are no noticeable loops, filler, or syntactic glitches, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. The main limitation is slight purple-prose pressure in places, which may narrow its fit for the most austere venues but doesn’t harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and mostly lean despite its lyricism; images like “broken things could still cast light, like a cracked lantern” and “wires singing in the wind” do multiple jobs at once. There is some repetition at the conceptual level (“backlash of regrets,” “broken” and “merrily melancholic” are revisited), but not enough to feel like looped scaffolding. Figurative language stays coherent and on-theme, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. A hair more variation in metaphor sources beyond the sea/light axis could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, packing multiple layers of image and information into each line (e.g., condensation that “tasted of copper and old prayers”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep momentum, and most figurative language is coherent and purposeful. However, metaphor and abstraction are nearly constant, flirting with purple prose in places (“pressure of paradox,” “glass that had learned to bend”), which can slightly blunt sharpness and immediacy. Line-level clarity remains intact, but a touch more spareness around peak beats would elevate it to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with rich imagery (“cinnamon and nebula dust,” “hands that were now made of starlight and patience”) and sentences that carry multiple layers of information. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and most metaphors are coherent and tonally aligned. There is mild tendency toward density and repetition of certain phrases (“cosmic intimacy,” “paradoxically steady”) that edges toward purple in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No significant loops or scaffolding dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and most metaphors are precise and mutually reinforcing; almost every line advances either world, character, or theme. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language (“clouds churned with choking beauty, so dense and luminous they seemed to press against her throat, filling her lungs with silver mist that tasted of regret”), but the images remain coherent and legible rather than muddled. Redundant scaffolding or synonym loops are minimal, and the closure image is clean and strong. The only deduction is for occasional purple bordering—density could be trimmed slightly without loss of effect.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., mothers’ tears crystallizing into a “prismatic code” that is both image and mechanism). There is some risk of over-saturation with metaphor and abstraction—terms like “integration,” “shadow,” “compassion-imbued” cluster—but they stay internally consistent with the story’s lexicon and do not obscure basic sense or causality. Sentence structures and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. The lyric intensity occasionally edges toward purple, yet the closing beats remain clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, often doing three jobs at once (world-building, theme, and mood) with strong rhythmic control. However, metaphor and abstraction density is very high—double helixes, universal machines, galaxies, geometry of creation—which sometimes feels stacked and a touch overwrought, slightly dulling impact through saturation. There are minor loops and explicit restatements of concepts (coincidences, philanthropy, catalyst) that could be tightened for sharper momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-by-line craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Repeated phrases and high metaphor density flirt with overwriting but rarely obscure meaning or momentum. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; most lines move either atmosphere, character, or plot. The lushness may be just a bit too uniform across the whole piece, blunting the impact of peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually do more than one job (worldbuilding, mood, and causality at once). Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; phrases like “burning like collapsed star dust in his skull” and “shadows that fell upward” deepen the concept without muddling sense. There’s mild risk of purple density in places, yet it doesn’t stall momentum or obscure the closure image. No noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense with information, and usually do double duty advancing setting and theme without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-motif, with a clear pattern (photography/darkroom, maps, storms) that keeps it from feeling random or purple. Some metaphors and abstractions (“architecture of survival,” “longitude and latitude of wounds”) risk feeling slightly overworked or thesis-like, but they remain decipherable and do not obscure closure. There are no notable grammar or rhythm artifacts, and momentum is well-maintained for a reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, evocative, and information-dense, with objects and actions often doing double duty for plot and theme. Phrases like “ruin of intention” and “dignified chaos” illustrate controlled metaphor rather than purple excess. There is some rhetorical weight and abstract phrasing that slightly blurs urgency in high-pressure beats, but it doesn’t impede clarity or momentum. Redundancy is minimal, and the final image resolves cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is clean: grammar and mechanics are solid, sentences vary in length, and most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously). Imagery like “rusted metal shelves holding stories that the warden feared more than knives” is sharp and efficient, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some figurative language and abstract formulations (“luminous fracture,” “texture of his current personality already loosening like old skin”) flirt with purple but remain comprehensible and thematically apt. A slightly tighter pass could trim a few near-redundant thematic restatements without harming mood, but the prose already reads above-average and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are purposeful and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm supports the accumulating tension. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and coherent (e.g., “the sky bruised purple at the edges”), and metaphors do not contradict each other or the world’s physics. There is some risk of lyrical saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image or elevated turn—which edges toward density but remains controlled and legible. The closing paragraphs maintain clarity while layering motifs, which keeps the closure image sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush yet mostly efficient, with many sentences doing dual work (world-building plus character psychology or stakes). Rhythm varies well, and key images (bioluminescent roots, translucent-boned ancestors, rain-bruised clouds) land cleanly without figurative muddle. There is some density of abstraction (“collective memory,” “symbolic meaning,” “cultural weave”) that could be pared back for even more immediacy, but it does not seriously impede clarity or momentum. Repetition of signature terms reads as motif rather than scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, clear syntax, and evocative figurative language that often does multiple jobs at once. The recurring metaphors around tides, silt, and diffusion are coherent and support the emotional logic. That said, there are moments of purple and slight paraphrase/abstraction loops (e.g., layered formulations of “navigation of sorrow,” “cartography of reconciliation,” and “color of unspoken apologies”), which soften momentum and immediacy. These do not break clarity or closure, but they keep the prose from a higher elite tier.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    High-quality imagery is marred by fatal grammatical artifacts likely caused by forcing prompt phrases ("Once, she preprocesses" mixes tenses; "dust from butterfly wing" lacks articles). These errors block immediate publishability despite the otherwise strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("frozen flame," "silvered the canyon"). However, the insertion of required phrases like "steadily adaptive" and "luminous glass artist" feels mechanical, creating minor drag. There are no major technical flaws, but the density of metaphor sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and "X of Y" metaphorical constructions ("symphony of thermals," "visual equivalent of a major chord") that slow momentum. The phrase "moved silently expressive" is grammatically awkward, and the reliance on cliché metaphors ("phantom limbs," "sun rising over still waters") dilutes the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("compression between pressure and memory"). However, the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "inadvertently stubborn" creates a noticeable scaffold artifact, and occasional phrases like "ocean opened like a wound" lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing that reads as unpolished artifacts (e.g., "gently persistent" and "amplified quiet" are both used twice in identical constructions). These echoes stall momentum and draw attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("circulatory system of capillary cracks," "body becomes a bellows," "irrigating deserts") that occasionally obscures clarity. The recurrence of the specific phrase "foggy lucidity" feels repetitive and forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from density and "thesaurus-itis," with phrases like "retrocognitively trapped" and "palimpsest of temporal residue" obscuring clarity with heavy modification. The required phrase "quaking reverie" feels inserted awkwardly into the syntax rather than arising naturally from the scene's rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm ("Boots crunched on the debris"). There are minor instances of adjective stacking, but the line-level craft generally supports the tone well without distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and high-density, with evocative imagery that drives the narrative forward. There is a slight tendency toward "purple" phrasing in the descriptions of the cells ("mindless division"), but the technical language of the hearing aid design balances the lyrical elements well. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively to match the ritualistic pacing of the forge work.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is often overwrought, marked by mixed metaphors ("heart... like a fist... press your ear") and clichéd compounds ("sister-truth"). These artifacts clutter the line level, obscuring clarity and momentum in favor of ornamentation that does not always land.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. However, the intrusion of prompt-labeling phrases ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully spirited") in the narration disrupts immersion, and occasional metaphors like the sun "bleeding" feel less fresh than the surrounding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is functional but marred by awkward phrasing used to integrate prompt requirements, specifically "stood firmly adaptive." There is a tendency toward overwrought description ("star-scattered void") that slows momentum during the decryption scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from metaphor overcrowding (e.g., "gleamed like submerged eyes," "viscous like honey," "sharp as broken flint"). The density of figurative language in adjacent sentences creates drag and triggers the overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density, though it relies on some stock robotic tropes ("titanium spine," "optical sensors"). The use of abstract nouns ("causality," "recursion," "amalgamate") in the climax slows the momentum, intellectualizing the moment rather than rendering it viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished but occasionally leans into purple territory ("crystal singing to water, water answering with truth," "cathedral of resonance"). While lyrical, these flourishes sometimes obscure the raw emotional reality of the betrayal/confession moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but prone to "purple" overwriting and abstract pairings ("rusted copper and renewal"); the density of "X like Y" similes and expository bridges slows momentum and creates a feeling of static observation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant scaffolding artifacts. Descriptions are evocative ("density that pressed against his eardrums like the weight of deep water"), though occasionally bordering on purple. The line-level craft successfully supports the ethereal nature of the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors that distance the reader ("silence possessed a texture"). The phrase "not through evaporation but through satisfaction" is a jarring instance of anthropomorphism that breaks the tone, and the repetition of "unstruck chords" (three times) creates a loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    While often vivid, the prose suffers from adjectival stacking ("auroral sorrow," "bruised purple") and occasional mixed metaphors. The line "Swaying certainties rocked her" is particularly clunky, forcing an abstract concept into a physical action in a way that disrupts the scene's gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density in almost every sentence. Metaphors like "spine of some buried leviathan" and "mandala that caught her light" are evocative without becoming clutter. The line-level craft successfully supports the weight of the story's subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract adjective-noun pairings ("regenerative silence," "absolute certainty") and lacks sensory specificity. Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb openers), creating a template cadence that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant issue with repetitive phrasing and label-use; "softly adaptive," "ordinary magic," and "cautious exuberance" appear multiple times as static descriptors, creating a "checklist" effect. The prose tends toward purple ("hush of dreaming roots," "fragment of infant wonder"), reducing information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive, clunky phrasing—specifically the awkward attribute "sensitively perceptive" appearing twice, once as a modifier for "nerves." Terms like "mnemonically" clash with the lyrical register, and the "bronze quiet" repetition indicates a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive use of the clunky noun stack "spycraft microdot film specs," which appears three times and disrupts rhythm. Heavy abstraction ("modulating his existence," "transposing life") often replaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but marred by repetitive element insertion ("muffled clarity" appears three times) and "telling" artifacts (e.g., "employing antimetabole"). Several similes ("cracking ice," "tumblers of a safe") are stock clichés that fail to elevate the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with high information density and some striking phrasing ("fluorescent-lit restaurants," "orange chicken"). However, the reliance on abstract nouns ("composition," "arrangement," "displacement") occasionally muddies the physical action, and the "realization" beats rely on repetitive sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense and occasionally repetitive (the oxymoron "darkening brightness" appears twice). A significant logic break undermines the climax: the protagonist is described as having gravity release its hold "completely," yet immediately "commits her weight" to the stone with a "wet slap," a physical impossibility that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from significant metaphor congestion ("gloves of stone," "captured starlight," "architecture of anticipation," "trapped bird" all in close proximity) which obscures clarity. Several clichés ("shattered heart," "tears tracing paths," "rain after drought") and a tense error reduce the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with excellent rhythm that mirrors the character's deliberate pacing. A few dense modifier stacks (e.g., "credibly curious precision") slightly slow the momentum, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level execution is severely hampered by grammatical errors (e.g., "while ultraviolet revealing the hidden contours" creates a fragment) and jarring tense inconsistencies. The prose is often overwritten and adjectival ("violent recognition," "cathedral of light"), prioritizing flowery description over clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but the insertion of prompt phrases like "ethically playful" and "passionate in his subtlety" creates palpable friction and awkwardness. These moments read as compliance artifacts rather than natural linguistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive phrasing harms the prose quality (e.g., "acoustically perceptive" and "magnificent simplicity" both appear twice as labels; "chronic hush" appears four times). Metaphorical confusion exists in lines like "glass walls now licking at the tide" (attributing the action to the wrong noun), and the text relies heavily on telling over showing for internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    Two glaring typos ("subume" instead of "subsume") in pivotal moments render the text unpublishable in a prestigious venue. Additionally, the four-time repetition of the phrase "professionally thorough" creates a robotic template cadence that exposes the scaffolding of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive verbatim phrasing ("whimsically attentive" and "cautious exuberance" both appear twice), indicating a lack of editing. Clichés ("surgical precision") and purple descriptions ("meteor dust") weaken the line-level quality. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is dense with adjectival padding ("frozen starlight," "spectral rainbows") that slows momentum. The phrase "luminescent ache" is inserted awkwardly, contributing to a "purple" aesthetic that obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically strong ("canals sang with an interrupted cadence"), though occasionally dense with adjectives. The high density of imagery generally supports the dreamlike tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose rhythm is controlled, but the text suffers from metaphor stacking ("tributary in the ceramic river") and telling-heavy exposition. Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly ("constituted an ambiguous loss"), disrupting the narrative flow with clinical or prompt-specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmical with strong imagery ("curled like metallic insects"). A few phrases lean toward the cliché ("pregnant with possibility") or overwriting, but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is often vivid, the prose suffers significantly from the repetition of distinctive phrases ("circuitously sincere," "reluctant metamorphosis," "sustaining transformation" each appear twice). These repetitions read as forced insertions rather than organic motifs, creating a mechanical rhythm that distracts from an otherwise polished style.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally high-quality, but the integration of required phrases causes friction. "Moved wryly earnest" is grammatically awkward, and the repetition of "thresh meaning" within a short word count creates noticeable textual artifacts that disrupt the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is lush but suffers from a high density of filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "realized," "understood") that dilute immersion. The required phrase "steadily unpredictable" is used twice; the second instance in the final sentence feels mechanical and disrupts the rhythm of the closing image. The imagery is strong ("melody made mineral"), but the execution leans toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the mechanical repetition of required phrases ("staggered intervals," "compile fragments into meaning," "ivory harbor after rain") which appear verbatim 3-4 times each. This creates a "template" effect that disrupts the rhythm and breaks immersion, despite otherwise competent description.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the prose contains evocative imagery, it suffers from significant "template cadence" and "text artifact" penalties due to the 3x repetition of "analytically artistic" and 2x "trembling certainty" within a short space. These clumsy repetitions, combined with occasionally purple phrasing, break the immersive quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by the clumsy insertion of prompt terms like "courageously kind determination," followed shortly by the repetitive "courageously vulnerable." These adverb-heavy constructions feel artificial and interrupt the flow. Additionally, the glossing over of the renovation mechanics creates a density of "telling" that obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with abstract phrasing ("calcified," "entropy"). The epiphany section suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("He saw...", "He understood...") that flatten the momentum of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Phrasing is occasionally repetitive (the phrase "deathly vitality" appears twice; "vintage ink pot" three times). The prose suffers from "telling" the mechanics of the prompt elements ("literally liquefied rigid thinking") rather than integrating them into the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The distinctive phrase "incandescent restraint" is repeated verbatim, creating a visible text loop that breaks immersion. The high density of metaphor ("frozen lightning," "pressure of minutes") occasionally clogs the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high textural density ("old bruises," "corrugated steel"). While some phrasing leans toward abstract overwriting ("negative space," "neural map"), the line-level craft effectively supports the sensory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("gloomy cheerfulness," "ephemeral compass," "universal riddle") which breaks immersion and reads like a checklist. Metaphor density is too high, leading to mixed or weak imagery like a "question mark made of smoke." The overuse of abstract nouns in place of concrete verbs stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but marred by noticeable clichés ("sharks scenting blood," "heartbeat before the scalpel") and abstract telling ("joy could be spreadsheeted"). These artifacts reduce the immediacy of the scene and give the writing a manufactured feel.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with good density ("razor-thin crescent"), but the required phrase "purposefully curious" appears twice in a way that feels mechanical. Phrasing like "mechanical predators" approaches cliché, but the technical descriptions of the chemical process balance this well.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally dense and sensory-rich, effectively conveying the technical magic. However, phrases like "organized chaos" and "mechanical heartbeat" are clichés that dull the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant deduction for repetitive artifact loops: "worrying tranquility" appears three times, and "subtly confident/ce" and "dry-witted" appear twice each, acting as scaffolds rather than organic description. While the rhythm is generally competent, these repetitive tags clutter the prose and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts mar the prose; "infinitely patient" (x3), "wild hush" (x4), and "ebony tuning fork" (x3) appear frequently in a short space, reading like unedited loops. This redundancy halts momentum and suggests a lack of lexical control or revision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally competent with clear imagery ("silver stream," "crystal perfume vial"). However, the specific prompt phrases ("unsnarl," "gathered hush") sometimes create rhythmic bumps or mixed metaphors ("unsnarl time itself"). The density of adjectives in places slows the momentum during what should be high-tension beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is often lush and evocative ("gnawed at the reef"), the story suffers from a heavy reliance on verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("sustains impossibilities" x4, "copperlight repose" x2, "lattice from confessional" x2). This creates a mechanical "checklist" feel in an otherwise fluid narrative, acting as a text artifact that distracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from awkward, forced phrasing ("ghost through ephemeral cameo appearances") and noticeable repetition of prompt strings ("winter-cracked fields," "mournful elation"). High-register abstractions ("resonant awakenings," "alchemical quicksilver") clutter the line level and obscure immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive noun clusters ("storybook illustration plate" appears four times) and purple phrasing ("arterial red," "liturgy"). The forced insertion of prompt phrases ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") creates visible seams in the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is dense and descriptive but suffers from clumsy phrasing ("across excavating a tomb," "hands moved warmly curious") and adjective stacking. The repetition of specific phrases to meet prompt requirements creates visible text artifacts that hinder readability and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level mechanics are clean, but abstract noun pairings and adjective-heavy descriptions reduce immediacy. The prompt phrase "carefully inventive" is inserted awkwardly as a modifier rather than demonstrated through a unique, high-pressure struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density without sacrificing momentum. Lines like "foolishness was architecture" and "stitching the negative space of treason" demonstrate mastery of craft. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops; the rhythm of the sentences mirrors the precise, measured action of the needle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-noun" overload ("trembling palm," "mangrove darkness," "phosphorescent shadow") and clunky sentence structures. The phrase "messages in condensation on windows being the only syntax capable of penetrating..." is syntactically weak and reads like a prompt justification rather than narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but dense with "purple" artifacts and strained metaphors ("breathing thing of vapor," "lotus-hearted ache"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "shrewdly innocent" feels mechanical rather than motivic. While the rhythm is smooth, the high adjective density and interpretive labeling reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose rhythm is generally smooth, but the text suffers from repetitive diction ("pensive" appears three times, "mirth/mirthful" three times) and reliance on clichés ("sugar in tea"). The density of adjectives occasionally clogs the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.5)
    The phrase "methodically playful" is repeated three times, creating a distraction; "she moved methodically playful" is grammatically awkward. Metaphors occasionally mix or bloat ("architecture," "question mark made of earth," "contract," "story that moved"), reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally strong but occasionally lapses into "purple" descriptors ("cathedral of glass," "crystalline clarity") and stock phrasing ("magician's grace"). While information density is good, the reliance on telling the character's internal state rather than showing it through sensation weakens the line-level impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("gargantuan" appears three times; "shyly unstoppable" and "centuries of longing" repeat as static labels). Heavy use of clichés ("pain, once sharp enough to cut steel," "darkness pressed its full weight") and filter verbs dulls the impact. The "via" construction in the final paragraph is mechanically inserted.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, specifically the phrase "gently systematic" appearing three times and "foxglove regret" twice in a short space. These verbatim loops break the immersive quality expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    Line-level craft is marred by distinct clichés ("heavier than lead," "fluttered... like caged birds") and repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("carefully reckless," "unsnarl"). The prose tends toward overwriting, using adverbs and abstract metaphors where concrete verbs would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" artifacts and clichés ("crystalline clarity," "profound emotional weight") that violate the "show, don't tell" standard. Adverb-adjective clusters like "slyly heartfelt" and abstract collocations like "dappled resolve" clutter the line-level execution. The technical detail ("portable spectrometer") clashes slightly with the established antique/mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by awkward phrasing ("Across learning to trust again" is syntactically jarring) and repetitive use of the "blooming withering" motif. These artifacts disrupt the reading flow and distract from the otherwise competent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and polished with strong imagery ("cartographer reading braille"). However, the required phrase "featherly determined" reads as an awkward modifier, and some metaphorical constructions ("storms first began to remember their own names") verge on being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The score is impacted by significant repetition of prompt phrases ("softly ingenious" appears three times, "luminous respite" three times), creating a template cadence and lexical loops. While the imagery is lush, the reliance on these specific clusters results in overwriting that obstructs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive loops damage the prose; full phrases like "cheerful gloom" (x3), "before memory fades" (x3), and the clunky "scattered seeds..." construction (x2) appear verbatim, reading like prompt-checking artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is marred by pseudo-scientific over-explanation (e.g., specific kilohertz frequencies) and "telling" artifacts (e.g., "defeated posture"). Repetitive phrasing ("lightly attentive") and some purple descriptions ("sediment falling from shoulders") distract from the clarity of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant text artifacts damage the prose: the four-word cluster "moonstone cabochon dust speck" and the phrase "spontaneously anchored" are each repeated 3–4 times, creating a jarring template cadence. These repetitions read as forced insertions rather than an intentional stylistic refrain, rendering the piece unpublishable in its current state.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.5)
    While polished, the prose suffers from density and overwriting ("bled violet," "fragile hour"). The reliance on complex metaphorical strings slows momentum, and the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases feels slightly mechanical within the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("voice cracking like old porcelain," "frozen lightning"). Phrase insertions from the prompt feel forced ("slow dance of celestial bodies"), and adjective pairs clutter the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent and rhythmic but dense with abstract noun phrases ("density of probability," "spectral proofs") that obscure concrete action. The repetition of key phrases like "serene upheaval" and "tide-polished" feels like a loop rather than a purposeful motif, contributing to a sense of static description.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of multi-word phrases constitutes a major flaw. "Half-burned diaries found in a fireplace" appears verbatim in paragraphs 2 and 5; "ivy-veiled passage" appears in paragraphs 1, 5, and 8; "corridor echo cartographer" is also repeated. These loops break the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of long phrases (e.g., "prism parapet after rain" x3, "coded lullabies..." x2) which read as checklist insertions. These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and break the "flawless" literary illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose rhythm is severely hampered by the triple repetition of three distinct complex phrases ("operatively gentle," "ritual significance," "slow dance of celestial bodies"), creating a palpable loop artifact. While the grammar is clean, the reliance on these static strings alongside purple phrasing ("blood-soaked valley") results in a stiff, constructed feel.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from "purple" overwriting and abstract phrasing ("geometry of absence," "architecture of calcium"). The density of similes ("sang like shattered glass," "gleamed like a broken mirror") distracts from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the rhythm is polished, the prose suffers from metaphor stacking (e.g., whetting a blade against a lullaby) and the conspicuous repetition of prompt phrases ("alarming serenity" and "bodily poetic" both appear twice). These artifacts and the dense "purple" descriptions hinder narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    The climax relies on filter verbs ("recognized," "understood") that summarize internal states instead of showing them. Some phrasing ("meteor hush," "epiphany arrived incomplete") leans toward purple prose, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is generally lush, the piece suffers significantly from lexical looping. Distinctive multi-word phrases ("blushing stillness," "interrupted cadence," "transiently rooted") are each repeated 2–3 times in a short space, reading as unblended artifacts that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative and polished, though occasionally dense with adjectives ("translucent ice ceiling in ribbons of violet and gold"). The repeated use of the required phrase "technically gentle" (three times) creates a distracting lexical loop that feels artificial. Otherwise, the rhythm supports the slow, ritualistic pacing of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally dense and imagery-rich. The repetition of the distinct phrase "precisely playful" (once for the wind, once for her movement) feels mechanical and slightly forced, creating a lexical loop. Some phrasing leans toward the abstract ("transcended not upward but inward"), but the overall rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic ("drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations"), with high information density and no scaffold. The repetition of the label "empirically ironic" in the climax feels slightly heavy-handed, telling the realization rather than trusting the image, but the overall craft is stellar.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with metaphors but suffers from significant repetitive phrasing, likely due to prompt insertion ("shifting grace" appears four times; "cellular memory" five times). Some metaphors border on mixed or muddled ("compassion laid like trapdoors"), and the high repetition of key terms drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prompt phrase "firmly grounded" repeats three times, becoming a distracting scaffold artifact that breaks immersion. The prose is otherwise polished but suffers from high simile density and occasional overwriting ("teeth of ice") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong specific nouns ("corbels," "resin," "rust"). However, some phrasing leans towards the precious ("green prayers," "deciduous vows" repeated three times), and the prompt-inserted phrase "endearingly feisty" stands out as a clunky adverb-adjective cluster. The line-level craft is otherwise dense and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("simply complicated" appears three times; "brightened disquiet" appears twice), creating a mechanical template cadence. These artifacts persist into the final paragraphs, disrupting the narrative flow and calling attention to the constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("unheard symphony of spores"), maintaining strong momentum. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the mandatory phrase "carefully resourceful cadence" reads a bit awkwardly, and small inefficiencies like "actually mapped" or adjectival stacking dilute the impact of key images.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is hampered by clunky phrasing ("chimera twin discoverer") and the insertion of definitions for prompt terms directly into the narrative flow. The density of adjectives and abstract nouns slows momentum without adding necessary information.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and adjectives ("foundational narratives," "intricate pattern," "reverent precision"). Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb openers), and the reliance on "telling" creates a sluggish rhythm during what should be the active climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, successfully carrying the story's heavy imagery, though it occasionally leans into adjectival clusters ("gently luminous," "soft blue-green") and expository bridges ("Mara understood then"). The rhythm generally supports the "tempest to silence" arc well.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, maintaining momentum despite a high density of adjectives. Metaphors like "hollow bones of civilization" are effective, though the writing occasionally leans into decorative "purple" territory.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rich with high-density imagery ("shadows spoke in geometry"), but the verbatim repetition of the complex phrase "preemptively nostalgic" three times in a short space feels mechanical and disrupts the lyrical flow. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the descriptive prose is often lovely, the text suffers from significant scaffolding artifacts. Specific phrases ("ambient awareness," "serious playfulness," "gravity of hopelessness," "filter") are repeated verbatim multiple times, including during the climax, which creates a "checklist" feel that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but occasionally purple; dense similes ("mirrors into windows") stall momentum and signal "literary" intent rather than emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of clunky phrases ("stretching contracted" appears three times; "xenial" four times; "intangibly tangible" twice). These artifacts break the rhythm and read as checklist compliance rather than organic description, significantly harming line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished on the sentence level with evocative imagery ("drowning in velvet"), though it occasionally leans toward the ornate. The primary flaw is the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("fluidly logical," "quiet that follows..."), which creates noticeable text-artifact loops. These insertions feel like checklist items rather than natural linguistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and readable with some strong images, but suffers from adjectival stacking and clichés like "impossible geometries." The rhythm is functional, yet the reliance on "action, then explanation" structures flattens the momentum in the latter half.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition of complex phrases ("tender shadow keeper" x4, "ashen charcoal sanctuary" x2, "fading threshold" x3) creates distracting artifacts and rhythmic monotony. Syntactic patterns often rely on simple Noun-Verb openers ("Elias understood," "Mira gasped," "He nodded"), reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose contains striking images ("crush submarines into origami"), but suffers from awkward integration of required phrases ("Shadowseam wonder enveloped her") and some abstract overwriting. The repetition of "virtuously mischievous" feels mechanical and forced, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting, specifically the loop of prompt phrases ("eloquently silent," "first yawn," "golden shadows") which appear twice each in a very short text. This repetition, combined with dense adjectival stacking ("vanilla scent of aging deceit"), stalls momentum and signals a lack of editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from "adjective-noun" saturation and awkward phrasing like "glowed factually mystical" that breaks immersion. The rhythm is monotonous, and abstract terminology obscures the physical immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is dense, the prose suffers from significant repetitive strain. The identical reuse of "tactfully hopeful" (modifier + adjective) in two different contexts and the triple use of "unfurl" are distracting artifacts that suggest a lack of line-level editorial polish.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and descriptive ("petrichor," "molten gold"), with a strong rhythm. There is a tendency toward density ("ceiling had collapsed... to admit the galaxy") that occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from density and forced phrasing, likely due to prompt integration. Constructions like "gleaming dully," "vested hush," and "quietly vivid" create friction, and the text relies on cliché similes ("like a familiar blanket"). The high frequency of adjective-noun pairings slows the momentum during what should be a high-pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but suffers from some noun-stacking artifacts ("moonstone cabochon dust speck") and abstract phrasing ("clarity that only mossy delight can bring") that hinders clarity. Filter verbs dilute the immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the prose achieves high density and strong imagery ("debris spiraled upward," "shattered into teeth"), it suffers from intermittent overwriting and metaphor abuse. Phrases like "vegetative reluctance" and "bruised sky" strain for effect, and the construction "darkness held substance and weight" is a cliché that dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with abstract adjective-noun pairings ("chiming finality," "phosphorescent certainty," "regret made luminous"). These constructions sometimes prioritize poetic sound over concrete clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    Competent prose marred by verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache") which creates a mechanical checklist effect. Reliance on summary for the confession and some clichés ("bird in a cage") reduce line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor congestion (e.g., "roots dangling with the silverware of her suffering"). Coherence issues arise from contradictory imagery (seeing "invisible" wavelengths vs. navigating by proprioception), and the density of abstract nouns hampers narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers significantly from the repetitive insertion of specific phrases ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," "between childhood and now," "unfasten"), which appear 3-4 times each in short succession. These repetitions read as forced checklist items rather than organic motifs, creating a "scaffold" effect that disrupts the rhythm and draws attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally high-density and lyrical, with strong imagery like the "expired confetti" and "gradients" of dust. The score is capped by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "skillfully observant," which creates a noticeable template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from a heavy density of adjective-noun pairings ("translucent branches," "swirling sea," "cryptic operator," "veined geometries") that creates a repetitive rhythm. While lines like "glass did not shatter so much as remember it was once sand" are excellent, the constant modification slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that stalls momentum (e.g., "sorrow polish their understanding like metal against velvet"). The opening sentence alone is heavy with adjectives and modifiers, and this ornamentation often obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story is presented as a single, dense block of text, which harms visual rhythm and pacing control. While the prose is polished, the high density of similes ("like a struck tuning fork," "like lovers," "like copper shavings") crowds the imagery and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity ("tasted of ozone and nostalgia"). Minor adjectival stacking ("impossibly, perfectly") and formulaic pairings appear occasionally, but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe text-artifact penalties apply due to the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("timewoven alliances" 4x, "scaffold complexity with simplicity" 3x, "turbine-hum reverie" 3x, "perpetually learning" 3x). This "synonym churn" and prompt-stuffing creates a rhythmic drone that obscures the story's actual action and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the flow is generally smooth, the prose suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush" both appear twice as noun phrases). There is also significant filtering ("She began to reckon," "She understood at last") that summarizes internal states instead of showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is dense and evocative but suffers from overwriting in key moments ("searing reverie burning away the boundaries"). The insertion of the required phrase "truth in tension" creates a rhythmic stumble, and the reliance on abstract nouns to describe action ("negotiation," "treaty," "benediction") blunts the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from a reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("skeletal piers," "salt-rotted shacks," "wind-torn silk") that can feel scaffolded. The imagery is strong, though at times the density of abstract nouns slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally polished and dense, but suffers from a few "purple" excesses like "silence within the silence" and "translucent question mark." The verbatim repetition of the phrase "velvet disquiet" in the final paragraph acts as a scaffold loop/thematic echo that feels artificial and forced (triggering the thematic echo penalty). While the imagery is often strong, the reliance on adjectival stacking in places slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but the register slips with the "taffy" simile, which clashes with the ancient/fractal tone. Additionally, the assigned attribute phrase "furiously tranquil" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a mechanical loop effect.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing ("tracking microclimate variations" appears three times) and grammatical artifacts from prompt insertion ("After the glue dries... she had tested" mixes present and past perfect tenses illogically). The phrase "credibly curious vibration" is a semantic error that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from abstract telling ("choreography of acceptance") and filter verbs ("He understood now," "He felt"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate physical experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high and imagery is strong ("lantern collecting dusk"). However, the prose suffers from mechanical prompt insertion ("Through contextual clues" appears twice as a clunky transition tag) and several missing articles that create a stilted rhythm in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("sugar in rain," "jade finger"), though it occasionally leans into adjective-heavy description. The density serves the dreamlike quality well, but a few phrases border on overwrought ("chromatic shift," "wound of twisted metal").

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetition of distinct descriptors ("burnished hush," "warmly attentive," "cobalt lagoon") distracts from the prose flow. The writing suffers from overwriting and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is descriptive, the sentence structure suffers from a repetitive cadence (Subject-Verb openings) that reinforces the list-like summary quality. There is a tendency toward "telling" exposition ("The diary explained," "Elias realized") over active dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but overwrought with adverbs and abstract phrasing ("gleaming wetly," "radiating the particular luminosity"). The density sometimes slows momentum, prioritizing decorative description over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though the specific phrase "narrow vastness" is repeated (lines 14 and 25), creating a visible artifact. The high density of adjectives occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is marred by a glaring grammatical error ("moved intuitively descriptive through the debris") resulting from the forced prompt element, which breaks the sentence structure. While the descriptive writing is often strong, it occasionally veers into purple prose ("metallic lungs").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density (e.g., "sugar in acid rain," "ghosts of acoustics," "abstract art" all in close proximity). The relentless adjective-noun pairings and frequent similes drag on the momentum, obscuring the physical reality of the scene under layers of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors ("impossible geometries," "fatal altitudes") that clutter the imagery and slow momentum. Several phrases feel inserted solely to satisfy prompt requirements ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon"), resulting in awkward syntax. The reliance on cliché descriptors ("copper and ozone," "fractal patterns") reduces the freshness of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text suffers from forced prompt insertions ("benevolently ruthless" appears twice) and repetitive abstract phrasing ("luminous absence"). The reliance on adjectives to carry weight ("essential ordinary," "false drama") weakens the density.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, successfully establishing a heavy, oppressive atmosphere. A few metaphors strain slightly (e.g., "clicking a rhythm like hidden thunder"—a sensory mismatch between sound and action), but the overall line-level craft is polished.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    A glaring tautology ("accumulated debris... that had accumulated") disrupts the prose flow in the central section. Additionally, the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases like "woven hush" and "fierce repose" within a short word count diminishes the lexical texture and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally evocative and rhythmic ("emerged as questions"), but marred slightly by efficient telling over showing (e.g., "innocently mischievous," "particular delight of someone who did not yet understand consequence"). These moments of exposition flatten the texture slightly in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and descriptive, with some strong imagery ("ash drifting like snow"). However, it suffers from a density of metaphorical abstractions ("pockmark a lost afternoon," "crystallized into something she could touch") that occasionally clutters the immediate action. The pacing is well-managed, accelerating appropriately with the sinking workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished, the verbatim repetition of unique prompt phrases ("intimately aloof" and "temporary eternity") within a short text creates distracting echoes that break immersion. The density of similes in the middle section ("like teeth," "like masts") slightly clogs the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from high-density overwriting and strained metaphors ("cataracts of salt," "tasted of iron and relief"). Abstract phrasing ("vibrations of intent") clutters the physical action, and the density of adjectives slows momentum during what should be the crisis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("bell a wound opening," "click like a bone"). There are minor instances of overwriting where metaphors become stacked or slightly purple ("neurological tide tied to," "swallowed all frequencies"), but the craft is generally polished and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally vivid, but lexical repetition becomes a distraction (variations of "fractured" and the phrase "psychological safety" appear three times each in a short space). Some internal states are filtered through telling ("Maren knew she should...") rather than shown through immediate reaction, slightly dulling the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("shades of pearl and ghost," "grafted onto her solitude like lichen"). The density of metaphor slows momentum in the middle beat, though the description of the "missing rust" is a standout example of specific, grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally evocative, but the awkward grammatical insertion of the required attribute ("empirically intuitive as he watched") disrupts the rhythm. Some thematic sentences feel slightly overwritten and dense.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and "adjectivitis," with mixed metaphors ("voices trembling... against the marble floors," "weaving cobwebs of silver dread") clogging the flow. The density of ornamentation obscures the action, and the reliance on cliché phrasing ("suspended moment," "veins... poised to strangle") weakens the literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is lush but occasionally overwrought ("twilight bled," "question mark made of mother-of-pearl"). Repetitive use of specific prompt phrases ("directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic") acts as a text artifact, disrupting the rhythm and feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    While ambitious, the prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("feral nostalgia that clawed... with teeth sharper than grief"). The phrase "surly bonds of sequence" is a distracting echo of Magee’s "High Flight." Heavy adjectival stacking ("sufficient jaded wonder") and abstract nouns occasionally clutter the line-level momentum, obscuring the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe looping of prompt phrases damages the prose; "reading between the lines," "emotional terrain," "ordinary miracles," and "trembling calm" each appear 2-3 times in short succession. This creates a "template cadence" effect that dulls the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe prose artifacts undermine the quality; full multi-word phrases ("crow quill trimmed tip," "saturated hush," "floating rock tea ceremony platform") are repeated verbatim multiple times, including during the climax. This creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    While the prose is evocative, it suffers from a "She [verb]" sentence-opener scaffold (seven instances) that creates a repetitive cadence. Some imagery leans on clichés ("dust motes," "autumn leaves") or mixed metaphors ("cello strings scraping against regret"). These line-level artifacts slightly obscure the story's otherwise sharp clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe artifact penalties apply; the awkward phrase "wanderingly exact" appears five times, and "resounding hush" and "universe's hiccup" three times each, creating a distracting loop. While the connective prose is competent, these repetitive clusters in such a short space destroy the flow and violate the standard for publishable polish.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose density and imagery are generally strong, but the story suffers from significant repetition of required phrases ("eminently peculiar" x4, "razor edge" x6). These artifacts disrupt the flow and draw attention to the construction rather than the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but overwrought, relying on strained metaphors ("heartbeat made visible and dangerous") and adjective-heavy description. While mechanically competent, the density of figurative language ("fractures," "pilgrimage," "galaxy") often obscures the immediate physical action and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and high adjective density ("clover melancholy," "verdant poetry," "mineral window"). Filtering phrases like "seeing how" and "she understood" distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally veers into overwriting with stacked metaphors ("grief crystallize into something beautiful and sharp," "architecture of hello"). While the rhythm is generally good, the reliance on adjective-heavy phrasing ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") creates a slightly ornamental texture that slows momentum. The line-level craft is competent but risks favoring style over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with evocative sensory details like "tannin and rain." However, the density of figurative language in the second half ("dissolved... like wet sugar," "frequencies") occasionally slows momentum and leans toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with some strong imagery ("tendrils curling through ticket machines"), though it sometimes tips into overwriting ("architecture of isolation"). There is a reliance on telling over showing during key transitions ("social hierarchies dissolved"), and the "bank executives wept beside street sweepers" image borders on cliché. Line-level mechanics are clean, but the density of abstract metaphors softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from standard mapping metaphors ("rivers of fear," "elevations of joy") that border on cliché. These familiar tropes dilute the novelty of the ultrasonic concept, and the density of abstract phrasing slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.2)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting, specifically the verbatim repetition of the phrase "dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib" four times and "strange comfort" three times. These loops create a jarring, templated cadence that obstructs flow and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is overwritten, prioritizing sound over precision with phrases like "liquid silver," "milky eyes," and "tapestry of negative space." The text relies on abstract noun-heavy constructions ("darkness shifted," "silence became visible") and label-only emotions ("joyful sorrow") that tell the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts damage the prose quality. The specific phrases "volcanic tenderness" (3 uses), "analytically intuitive/analytical" (4 variations), and "volcanic" (5 uses) are hammered in mechanically, creating a distracting drumbeat that undermines the intended lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("hollow resonance"), but the density of specific noun phrases ("auric lagoon," "sound wave garden") creates minor repetition artifacts. The motif of the "hush" is effective but borders on overuse within the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("signature in wet cement"). The writing flows well, though the repetition of the specific phrase "calculated spontaneity" (used twice) acts as a minor repetitive artifact that breaks the immersion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of awkward phrases ("spiralingly calm" x3, "half-spoken secret" x2, "stillwater tension" x2) which reads like a glitch or forced constraint insertion. These repetitive artifacts disrupt the rhythm and break immersion, while the density of modifiers slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lush but overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and metaphors ("trembling frequencies," "celestial geometries") that slows momentum. The reliance on list-like sentence structures to convey the town's inner lives creates a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; the complex phrase "combative tenderness" appears twice, and "guarded heart" four times. These echoes disrupt the rhythm and read as unpolished placeholders rather than intentional motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is evocative but marred by repetitive descriptors for the face ("smooth plane," "blank face," "wiped slate") and lexical looping of "morally ambiguous." Some reliance on adverbs and abstract labels ("theatrical gravity") weakens the showing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    The phrase "lantern-moth hush" is repeated three times in a short text (opening, middle, close), creating a distracting loop artifact. Additionally, prompt phrases like "aesthetically driven" and "tremor of certainty" are inserted with visible seams, disrupting the rhythmic flow and syntactic naturalness.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose has moments of lyrical quality, it falls into cliché ("perfectly imperfect") and abstract summary of sensation ("visible to Elara as disturbances").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally capable but suffers from "telling" at the climax, summarizing the system's logic instead of dramatizing the reaction. The required phrase "powerfully gentle" is oxymoronic and used awkwardly twice, disrupting the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is lush but suffers from significant repetition of required phrases ("genuinely artificial" x3, "subdued ardor" x2, "rock bottom" x2) which feel like checklist artifacts. The density of abstract metaphors ("curtains of intention," "architecture of ascent") occasionally obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense but marred by "thesaurus-itis" (e.g., "luminescence," "metastasized") and cliché similes ("crystallizing like frost"). The mechanical repetition of prompt phrases like "rain-beaded" (three times) and "steadily curious" disrupts the rhythm and reads as forced insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose flows well but suffers from noticeable repetition artifacts. The phrase "anguished joy" appears three times (paras 1, 5, 7) and "end of innocence" appears three times (paras 1, 6, 9), creating a loop that dulls their impact. Some sentence structures feel slightly scaffolded around the prompt terms.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.8)
    The phrase "softly deliberate(ly)" is repeated four times in a short space, including in the final paragraph, creating a distracting mechanical artifact. While the grammar is functional, these repetitions and the reliance on abstract nouns ("collective unconscious") significantly hamper the prose's flow and professional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    While grammatically sound, the prose suffers from overwriting and abstraction, particularly in key descriptions ("quietly vivid turquoise of distress," "shimmering stillness"). Clichés such as "chaos had reigned" and "dawn approached" dilute the visual specificity and weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is evocative but frequently overwrought, suffering from high metaphor density that occasionally muddles the imagery (e.g., "geological coffee stains"). There is a noticeable repetitive cadence in sentence structures ("Elias woke," "Elias touched," "Elias needed," "Elias knelt"), creating a rhythmic monotony that drags against the narrative momentum. Exposition regarding the telepathy is somewhat heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant deduction for artifact loops: the phrase "While forgotten lyrics search for tune" is pasted verbatim three times, creating a jarring, mechanical scaffold that disrupts momentum. Additionally, the repetition of "incubate," "hushed thunder," and "spatially imaginative" within a short text creates a claustrophobic, repetitive lexical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and abstract labeling, such as "symphony of salvation," "exquisite terror," and "shadowed rapture." These phrases obscure concrete action and sensation. There is also repetition of prompt phrases like "unspoken words" that feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rhythmically strong but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity (e.g., "decay's soft persuasion"). The reliance on adjective-heavy description and abstract phrasing ("white hardness of duty") slows momentum in favor of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in lines like "exhaled steam into gear-box flowers." The imagery is imaginative and specific. A few moments of metaphorical density ("copper-wire mycelium... silica and sap") slow the reading speed, but the craft is generally high and the "read-aloud" quality is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but dense with filter verbs ("Mara realized," "understanding now," "feeling the star stamp") that distance the reader from the immediate action. The rhythm is lulling, fitting the "lullaby" motif, but the density of adjectives slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("undisguised horror," "gentle determination," "desperate intensity," "frostbitten hope") that create a repetitive, scaffolded rhythm. While functional, these constructions often rely on clichés ("trembling finger") or heavy modification rather than strong verbs, slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    The verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "regally unpretentious" in the first and sixth paragraphs creates a distracting prose echo. While the imagery is often evocative, some phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("sweating fist," "terrible finality"), reducing the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("crystalline drives," "staccato against the metal"). However, the integration of required phrases creates minor rhythmic stumbles; "drifted moored" and the repetition in "periodic pulse... periodically eternal" feel slightly mechanical and redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose relies on adjective-heavy abstraction ("bleeding hour," "thunderous serenity") and static constructions ("It was the sound of..."). Momentum drags due to over-explanation of internal states that could be shown through gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and sensory-rich ("tasted like lightning and chlorophyll"), though occasionally dense with adjectives. The rhythm supports the pacing well, particularly during the climax of the amber splitting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is weighed down by heavy "telling" and the repetitive use of clinical jargon ("somatic marker" appears three times). Abstract phrasing ("optimism untethered from reality") replaces concrete imagery in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose leans toward the overwrought, with dense adjectival phrasing ("luminescent ache," "hollow sympathy") that slows momentum. While grammatically sound, the reliance on poetic abstraction often obscures concrete action in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive use of full noun phrases ("artificial hummingbird drone," "wind-carved encampment") that read like unedited prompt insertions (scaffolding artifacts). Additionally, the climax halts the scene's momentum for a paragraph of abstract explanation. These issues create a drag on the reading experience despite otherwise functional grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by excessive verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("dangerous liaison letter" x4, "echoing library under snow" x3, "dizzying quiet" x3). This creates a distracting loop effect that significantly hampers line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("fractured through the dome's spiderweb cracks"), with good information density. However, the repetition of the phrase "senselessly perceptive" three times feels more like a mechanical tag than an organic character trait, and some descriptors border on the ornate ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet").

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive artifacting. The verb "transliterate" is used five times in similar constructions ("transliterate his anxiety," "transliterated his grief," etc.), and "sleepwalking" appears five times. This synonym loops and heavy metaphor density create a claustrophobic rhythm that stalls momentum and reads as a mechanical insertion of keywords.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is high-density and propulsive, though occasionally bordering on purple (e.g., "sound like silver coins dropping into velvet"). The repetition of "solemn playfulness" serves as an effective frame, and the line-level description of the calculation keeps the pacing tight.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally lush and evocative ("conducted memory like copper wire"), but occasionally veers into melodrama ("screamed beneath her ribs") or mixed metaphors. The density is high, maintaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density and reliance on abstract metaphors ("geometry of forgotten names") that obscure the physical action. There is a "purple prose" quality with repetitive color signaling (violet, lilac, lavender, amethyst) that feels decorative rather than functional. The phrase "ceramic atoms" breaks the established atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.0)
    Repetitive use of specific keywords ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical," "warm coldness") creates a checklist feel and clutters the prose with visible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts damage the prose; the full phrases "hand-painted tarot coin" (3x), "fractured timeline" (4x), and "synesthetically blessed" (2x) appear verbatim, reading like a checklist. This lexical redundancy flattens the rhythm and pulls the reader out of the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from "purple" density ("geography of desperation," "willowglass hope crystallizing") and the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases like "fractally precise." These artifacts, along with a few filter verbs, drag on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flow is competent, but the text relies on abstract noun pairings ("abandonment and hope") and stock similes ("like ghosts"). The awkward repetition of the phrase "factually mystical" stands out as a forced insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers from a disqualifying meta-artifact: "She had succeeded in her motivation: to spin a prophecy..." which breaks the fourth wall. Additionally, the phrase "quietly inspired" is repeated twice as a label, and the tense error in the middle segment further degrades line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished with solid imagery ("clung... like gauze"), but the integration of required phrases creates awkward artifacts ("prudently daring gait"). The rhythm is steady, though the repetition of prompt words draws attention to the scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the rhythm is generally controlled, the repetition of the word "percolate" twice within three lines creates a distracting echo. The prose suffers from some mixed or heavy-handed metaphors, and the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases occasionally disrupts the natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose rhythm is smooth and polished, with strong sentence-level craft. However, some phrasings border on purple ("entropy of the wasteland," "bruised dawn sky"), and the specific phrase "phototropic to kindness" feels awkward and forced within the sentence structure. The "thrumming" description ("Not with sound exactly, but with vibration") is a slight cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is heavily damaged by the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("wistfully pragmatic," "quivering hush," "rhythm of oars in water") within a short word count. This creates a loop artifact that reads as a checklist rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from verbatim repetition of prompt keywords ("atomically reflective" x3, "brittle awakening" x3, "tidal library" x3) within a short space. These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and create a "fill-in-the-blank" feel despite the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a visible typo ("wide as a embrace") and clumsy repetition of prompt phrases ("inevitably whimsical" appears twice in identical constructions; "prismatic quiet" is repeated). These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but relies on some clichés ("swirling like galaxies," "fear coiling," "clenched fists"). Crucially, the literal insertion of prompt phrases ("ethereal grit of the moment," "cautiously hopeful" repeated verbatim) breaks immersion and reads as a checklist rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose rhythm is strong and propulsive. Information density is high. The score is held back by a few label-heavy constructions in peak beats ("violence that was neither rage nor despair but wistful rebellion"), which trade immediacy for abstract definition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Specific phrases are carelessly repeated ("furrowed hush" in paragraphs 3 and 7; "lance the [noun]" in paragraphs 2 and 6), signaling a lack of line-level polish. These text loops distract from the otherwise dense prose and highlight the artificiality of the inserted prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally evocative but marred by the verbatim repetition of unique prompt phrases ("spongey dread" and "nervously confident" both appear twice), creating noticeable artifacts. The reliance on filter verbs and some clunky exposition ("legal pretense of clemency") drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by the forced repetition of clunky prompt phrases ("dynamically observant," "scaffold wrap flutters," "pixelated amnesty") which disrupts rhythm and naturalism. High metaphor density ("chemical skin," "instrument made of air") creates drag, and abstract noun clusters obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose has rhythm, it is marred by cliché ("flowed like wine") and forced phrasing required by the prompt ("dusk settle... with a dusky harmony" is redundant). The density of figurative language sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose relies on slightly repetitive epithets (e.g., "daylily-pressed telegram" used as a fixed tag). The density of abstract nouns in the climax ("solace," "clarity," "luminosity") weakens the visual impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is functional but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and abstract metaphor ("warlike serenity," "consuming life") that obscures the concrete action. Several moments rely on "telling" the character's internal state ("Her motivation burned steady") or using filter verbs ("She understood then that") instead of showing the evidence through action or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by the clumsy, verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("purposefully curious," "anxious elation") within a short space. These act as text artifacts that break immersion and read as checklist compliance rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm is generally strong, but the prose suffers from stock metaphors ("liquid mercury") and repetitive prompt-phrase insertions ("fiercely gentle" appears twice). These artifacts and the slightly purple density in the middle section clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative with strong imagery ("metallic ghost," "calcified memory"), but suffers from filter-verb stacks ("Marcus felt," "Marcus found himself," "He realized") that blunt the impact. The "insulating emotionally with facts" phrase is a purposeful repetition, but the explicit analysis of feelings in the final third tells more than it shows.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose creates a strong atmosphere but suffers from a mechanical "template cadence" artifact where required phrases are inserted with identical sentence structures ("Through analogical thinking..." appears twice as a sentence opener). Repetitive labeling ("kindly methodical," "haunted ambitions") also clutters the rhythm and feels artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is high-density and polished, with strong imagery ("time had pooled rather than flowed," "glaciers calving"). The rhythm mimics the tidal setting effectively. There are no significant loops or artifacts, and the language elevates the simple plot into something atmospheric and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is heavily overwritten with mixed metaphors ("static from a dying star," "DNA encoding grief") and repetitive diction. The word "resonance" or "resonant" appears four times, including "resonant hush" twice and "unspoken resonance" in close proximity, creating a distraction that dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and dense with strong sensory imagery. Rhythm varies effectively to match the protagonist's state. A few phrasings border on the melodramatic ("ivy threading... like green fingers") or feel slightly awkward ("come here daringly methodical" reads as a grammatical stumble), but the overall line-level craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from high adjective density ("coagulated into walls of living luminescence") and "purple" phrasing that slows momentum. Several sentences function as expository mechanics for the magic system rather than active beats, and the repetition of the label "cautious exuberance" bookends the piece with told emotion rather than felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and evocative, though occasionally dense with modifiers (e.g., "sharp, green, photosynthetic terror"). The repetition of "mulberry" (jam, ache, stain) creates a slight lexcial loop, drawing attention to the prompt rather than the scene, but the rhythm generally supports the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting and repetition (e.g., "cascade... cascading"), and metaphors occasionally clash ("waterfall... cliffs"). The density of adjectives slows momentum without always adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is weighed down by strained similes ("pressed against the eardrums like wine pressing against cork") and clichés ("pregnant with the possibility"). Repetition of prompt phrases ("vineyard hush," "kindly decisive," "scallop") within a short space creates noticeable artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("maps drawn in ink that bled"). However, there are moments of self-conscious repetition ("edges biting sincerely into his insincere smile") and the phrase "wind chime selections" feels slightly stiff within the otherwise lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but a jarring tense shift ("whispered... and he weaves truth carefully") disrupts the flow in a key sentence. While the imagery is strong, this mechanical error in the integration of a required element detracts from the polish.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text artifacts mar the prose; specific phrases ("centuries of layered dust," "pulse left wandering," "canyon of endless echoes," "historically reverent") repeat verbatim 3–4 times each, creating a mechanical, looped cadence. This redundancy stalls momentum and reduces information density, reading more like a checklist than an organic narrative flow. The prompt insertion "through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" creates a distinct syntactic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition artifacts. Phrases like "lingering luminance" (4x), "accommodating impossibilities" (3x), and "brilliant dimness" (3x) appear too frequently for a text of this length, creating a mechanical, checklist-like feel that detracts from the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative but suffers from some overwriting ("dust made of amethyst") and the awkward integration of required phrases ("wandering purposefully"). The repetition of "meteor hush" and the telling-heavy conclusion detract from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. While the prompt-mandated phrases ("stellar doubt") occasionally verge on melodramatic, the surrounding text supports them with rich imagery ("golden resin," "chiming softly"). There is a slight reliance on repetitive motifs (amber, static), but the line-level craft is generally polished.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, though it leans toward "purple" phrasing (e.g., "specters in the spectrum"). The metaphor stack describing the monsters ("leviathan of her laughter, kraken of their interrupted future") feels slightly constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetition of specific prompt phrases ("lukewarm" x4, "earnest" x4, "brittle" x3, "cosmic imbalance" x3) within a short space. These echolalia artifacts create a scaffolded, repetitive rhythm that distracts from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is evocative with high-quality images like "bats began to stitch the sky" and "scar healing in reverse." The score is capped by the "glossy paper" description, which creates a jarring credibility artifact, and occasional mixed metaphors in the denser descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on abstract pairings ("petrichor and possibility") and metaphorical summary ("algorithms too complex") rather than concrete action. The density of adjectives slows momentum, and the climax is "told" through high-concept imagery rather than shown through grounded beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant lexical repetition creates drag; "soundless echo" appears three times, "parachute buckle" five times, and "revised/revision" four times in a short text. These loops flatten the prose texture and read as unpolished artifacts rather than intentional motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from density of abstraction and telling over showing, particularly in pivotal moments ("The transfer occurred not as replacement but as conversation"). Specific phrases like "method of complementary opposites" are inserted as clunky labels rather than woven into the action, stalling narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of the nine-word phrase "across the hush of a possibility just born" and awkward, unintegrated prompt insertions ("mystery seed mail") that disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and prompt-forced artifacts. The clunky noun stack "pull cord handle" appears five times, and "macerate" (in various forms) appears seven times, creating a robotic cadence that disrupts the narrative flow. These repetitions read as transparent prompt adherence rather than intentional stylistic choices, marring the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("breath forming glyphs"). The phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is slightly clunky and abstract, but the surrounding description grounds it. Line-level craft sustains the "foggy lucidity" tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, with phrases like "frozen bloom," "successive approximation," and "interrupt a stifling destiny" each appearing multiple times in a short text. These loops clutter the rhythm and highlight the artificiality of the prompt insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("low modal drone," "crystalline lattice") and good rhythm. Minor overuse of filter verbs ("noting," "suspected") creates unnecessary distance in what should be visceral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the imagery is often striking, the prose suffers from explanatory telling ("confirming they had slipped") and dense adjectival stacking. Key moments are summarized rather than inhabited, and phrases like "resiliently positive" weaken the line-level impact by substituting labels for description.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains striking imagery ("live wire wrapped in velvet") but suffers significantly from phrase-looping artifacts. Recurring multi-word labels ("rational enchantment" x4, "unsettling calm" x3, "realistically imaginary" x3) in a short space create a mechanical texture that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally evocative and maintains momentum, with strong imagery. Deductions apply for the repetitive use of the specific phrase "somber marvel" (appearing as a definition shortly after its first use) and occasional "purple" tendencies in descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density ("died screaming into plastic and wire"). However, the metaphor "radioactive with consequence" constitutes a register clash, introducing a modern scientific jaggedness that disrupts the established antiquated, atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Imagery is often striking ("swallow the sun," "frost... evaporate"), but the prose is weighed down by explanatory scaffolding ("simulating the crushing embrace," "existing as both barrier and bridge"). These lines interpret the experience for the reader rather than allowing the concrete details to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally tips into purple territory with phrases like "silence now pregnant with possibility." The rhythm is generally strong, but the reliance on heavy adjective-noun pairings slows momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("trapped lightning," "meaningless percussion"). The rhythm supports the mythic quality well. A few moments lean slightly purple, but the high information density and lack of scaffold sentences keep the momentum strong.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, but slips into cliché or mixed tone at key moments (e.g., gravity playing "like a kitten with yarn" clashes with the cosmic horror tone). Some descriptions feel slightly overwrought ("frequencies that bent light") without physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose has a polished rhythm but relies heavily on "telling" via continuous aspect ("was signaling") and abstract noun phrases ("geometric precision"). Adverb-heavy descriptions and filter verbs ("She saw," "She felt") distance the reader from the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but overwritten in places, leaning on abstract nouns and adjective-heavy descriptions ("sullen grey," "fragile intersections"). The frequent insertion of explanatory clauses halts momentum, particularly in the final paragraph which dissolves into abstract summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose flows well but suffers from tautological phrasing like "gleamed with a whispering gleam" and clichés such as "pregnant with tomorrow's music." While the imagery is lush, the density of adjectives and abstract nouns occasionally obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally polished but relies on some clichés ("trembling fingers") and abstract phrasing ("particular brand of observed solitude"). The "Pringles" reference, while vivid, creates a jarring register break against the "tattered silk" and "comet's tail" imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from density and cliché ("time stretching like taffy," "tuning fork struck against bone") that create significant drag. Metaphor stacking often obscures the physical action, and abstract descriptors ("dangerous alchemy") replace concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but suffers from adjective-heavy description ("copper-bright," "soft amber") and abstract phrasing. The phrase "stepped unassumingly bold" is grammatically jarring and reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory details like "pages soft with humidity" and "calcified." A few phrases lean toward the clichéd ("greenhouse held its breath," "glittered like stellar dust"), but the overall texture is polished and supports the moody atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but peak moments rely on stock metaphors ("blade wrapped in velvet," "ferocious love") that blunt the impact. These clichés reduce the freshness of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors ("chlorophyll and memory," "oil-slick rainbows"), often slowing momentum. Repetitive phrasing ("verdant parapet," "radiant hush," "insatiably creative") and forced prompt insertions disrupt the line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally evocative and dense, with strong imagery. However, the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases—specifically "tapestry needle," "accumulated silence," and "interlaced hush"—creates a repetitive drag that feels like keyword insertion rather than organic variation. These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth lyrical flow.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and flows smoothly, with strong imagery ("traced the intentions of cartographers"). There is a tendency toward modifier stacking ("perceptive map framer," "rain-scoured fresco vault"), but line-level craft is generally high quality and free of major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the "sophisticated melancholy" brief well. There is a tendency toward slightly purple metaphor ("waterlogged cathedral," "specific gravity of grief"), but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by extreme keyword stuffing and loop artifacts; "flower press bolt plate," "driftingly alert," "between lightning and thunder," and "tinkersong wonder" each appear 3–4 times in a short text. This repetitive "template cadence" disrupts flow and readability, resulting in a heavy penalty for text artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and sensory, with strong density in descriptions like “mechanical flower blooming.” However, the reliance on telling over showing in pivotal character beats—summarizing complex realizations in a single sentence—and occasional stock phrasing (“spiderweb pattern”) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is dense with abstract modifiers and suffers from the repetitive use of the phrase "dusty starlight" and "quietly explosive," which read as unpolished artifacts. The heavy reliance on metaphor ("fibers splayed like nerve endings") occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the descriptions are rich, a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence pattern creates a scaffold effect that drags the rhythm in the middle paragraphs. The phrase "fractally precise" is repeated verbatim, and the opening metaphor density is high, slowing the entry.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and adverbs ("diligently curious," "shifting charcoal waves," "hypnotic undulations") that clutter the rhythm. Clichés like "tired giant" and "ghost footprints" reduce the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose relies on stock imagery ("sighed," "heard in dreams") and adjective-heavy descriptions. The insertion of "driftwood nostalgia" stands out as a forced artifact that disrupts the logical flow of the frozen imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose quality suffers from severe artifacts, including a tautological sentence in paragraph 5 ("messages that had appeared through messages") and the reuse of the unique phrase "brambled hope" in adjacent paragraphs. These slips, along with repetitive diction, disrupt the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant "text artifact" issues due to the looping of prompt phrases ("pane of hush" x4, "vouchsafe" x3, "nested patterns" x3). This repetition creates a template-like cadence that distracts from the otherwise polished imagery and interrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases: "graceless beauty" appears three times and "offhandedly exact" twice in a short span. These distinct lexical loops act as significant artifacts that disrupt the reading flow and undermine the polish expected in a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished but dense with metaphor, occasionally bordering on purple ("delta logic," "symphonically minded"). There is a reliance on "telling" realizations ("As the pieces fell into place," "She understood that") which creates distance from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally dense with adjectives ("luminescent vessels," "surgical intention"). The repetition of "mindfully" (used for the same action in two different paragraphs) and the slightly clunky insertion of the phrase "integrated fragmentation" create minor rhythmic stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    While sensory details are strong ("flavor left topography"), the prose suffers from "checklist" insertions. The phrase "stood sturdy brittle" is grammatically awkward (missing conjunction/punctuation), and the repetition of "sandpaper" and "unspoken dream" in intro and outro feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with modifier stacks ("vigorous tender melody," "trembling but resolute"), creating a sluggish rhythm. The reliance on abstract nouns and telling ("understands profoundly," "deliberate ceremonial care") distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors (e.g., biological synapses vs. winter rivers vs. quantum foam), creating a dense, confusing texture. The verbatim repetition of the prompt's attribute constitutes a major artifact that disrupts flow and lowers the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose momentum is marred by the verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "clandestinely luminous" within a short space, which reads as a drafting artifact. Occasional clichés like "breath from some sleeping beast" detract from the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases like "symphonically minded" and "empathy in motion." These repetitions disrupt the natural flow and draw attention to the artifact rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("hair on a cat's back"). However, the insertion of the required phrase "thoughtfully precise" results in a grammatical stumble ("studied the configuration thoughtfully precise"), and some metaphors lean toward the familiar ("silence... clearly as a shout").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("theatrical sincerity" and "intuitively descriptive" both appear twice), which breaks immersion. The writing is technically functional but weighted down by modifier-heavy constructions and abstract nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is dense but suffers from redundancy ("wildflower hush" repeated) and awkward constructions; "journalized" is a bureaucratic verb choice for a nature piece. Additionally, describing the Titan Arum as having a "parasitic youth" is botanically incorrect (conflating it with Rafflesia), undermining authority.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Phrasing is occasionally overwrought ("impossible equilibriums") or clunky ("stone surfaces now become floors"), slowing momentum. The phrase "whirling silence" is used as a bookend but feels more like a repetitive descriptor than a deepening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Imagery is often vivid ("unnatural canyons," "corrugated steel boxes"), but the integration of the required phrase "rapidly adapting" results in a grammatical stumble in the opening ("required her to be this rapidly adapting") and a biological oddity later.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and adjective density ("synesthetically blessed," "sonic architecture," "bureaucratic ash"). This heavy ornamentation slows narrative momentum and often substitutes abstract descriptors for concrete, grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.3)
    Significant loop artifacts present: "arranging driftwood as directional markers," "harvesting insights from failure," and "avalanchingly quiet" each appear verbatim multiple times. This repetition creates a scaffolded, artificial texture that severely hampers line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is dense and rhythmic, it suffers from overwriting and reliance on clichés like "light that wasn't light" and "perfect darkness." Metaphors are frequently mixed or abstract ("liquid emotion," "numbers align in the halo's glow"), which creates opacity rather than depth. The density of figurative language occasionally chokes the momentum, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a reliance on filter verbs ("Elias felt," "Elias understood") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. There is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("spectral green glow," "ionized air") that slows momentum without always adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    Heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("shifted hush" appears three times; "truthful lies" and "firmly grounded" twice) creates noticeable scaffolding artifacts. Clichés like "grief like a sponge" detract from the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence") within a short word count. These echoes read as unedited artifacts or prompt-forcing rather than intentional motifs, severely impacting readability.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") and standard phrasing ("weight of what she was about to attempt," "knife's edge") that reduces immediacy. Sentence structures are often repetitive (Subject-Verb openers), and the density of information is diluted by explanatory clauses that tell the reader how to interpret the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Abstract nouns serve as agents too often ("truth was assembling itself"), creating distance. The forced integration of the prompt phrase "use the cyclical spontaneity" creates a jarring, clunky syntactic artifact that disrupts the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the prose is polished, the density of figurative language is too high, with similes or metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence ("like a warning," "like coastal flowers," "like failed punctuation"). This relentless imagery occasionally slows momentum and reduces the starkness of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the score; specific phrases ("total internal reflection," "accidentally prophetic," "otherworldly routine") are repeated verbatim 3–4 times each. This redundancy creates a checklist-like cadence and stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is elegant but suffers from metaphor density ("like foreign architecture," "like sediment," "like dye," "like spores"), which slows momentum. The phrasing "quietly explosive truth detonate" borders on redundant modification.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with some striking images ("legs splayed like a wounded insect"), showing good attention to craft. However, the density of metaphorical language occasionally borders on purple ("language of roots and rings"), slowing momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative but suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors (weaving, singing, architecture, and swaddling collide in the same beats). Scientific terms like "photons" clash with the mythic tone of "antediluvian song." The narrative occasionally slips into essay-like exposition ("manifested not as magic but as consequence") that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from abstract noun-heavy phrasing ("logic of uncertainty," "sanctity of his isolation") that tells rather than shows. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" is repeated verbatim, creating a distracting artifact. The reliance on adjectives and explanations slows momentum and distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prompt phrase "heuristically gentle" is used ungrammatically as an adverb ("worked heuristically gentle"), creating a jarring line-level error. The prose tends toward purple density ("divinity hid not in cathedrals," "silent increments"), which slows momentum. The reliance on summary creates a "telling" cadence that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("dissolved into vapor," "breath crystallizing"). While the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases like "quartz hush" and "gently meticulous" creates a slight mechanical echo, the overall line-level craft supports the story's gravity and momentum without scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting: "comforting unease" and "false starts" are repeated verbatim multiple times, including in the final paragraph. This constitutes a severe scaffold loop that obscures the scene's momentum and texture. While sentence construction is otherwise competent, these repetitive clusters dominate the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is lush and imaginative but occasionally overwritten ("bridal train of atmospheric disturbance"), slowing momentum. There is a repetitive structural artifact in the sensory descriptions ("tasted copper... then honey... then salt" and "tasted snow, then lavender, then..."), which creates a noticeable template cadence. The density is high, but the line-level focus sometimes prioritizes ornamentation over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    Verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("auroral sorrow" x3, "uncork her suppressed creativity" x2, "inescapable calling" x2) creates a stilted, checklist-like rhythm. These artifacts disrupt the narrative flow and signal a lack of organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from adjective density and clunky noun stacks like "zinc-etched postal plate fragments." A logic slip occurs in the climax where Aurelia begins to "reread the words of strangers" upon opening an envelope, which confuses the action (one reads new letters; one does not reread them immediately).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    While readable, the prose relies on some clichés ("oiled precision") and abstract telling ("chain of causality," "surrendered to natural force"). The frequent use of adjective-noun pairings ("muted vigor," "piercing note") creates a slightly repetitive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive overuse of specific keywords ("strangely organic" x4, "miniaturize" x5, "controlled burn" x4). These repetitions read as prompt-checklist artifacts rather than organic motifs, creating a scaffolded feel that disrupts the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is technically functional but cluttered with clichés and awkward phrasing to accommodate prompt elements ("attribute that would unlock this puzzle was leads through following"). The repetition of "sandstorm calm" (three times) and the use of sentimental similes ("like healing water") reduce the impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing, notably the "spider spinning its web" simile appearing almost verbatim in paragraphs 1 and 3. Additionally, reliance on abstract verbs ("interpreting," "explaining") distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally evocative but suffers from a noticeable repetition loop ("gravity fluctuated... creating pockets of gravity") and some clichéd phrasings ("rules older than physics"). These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth rhythm of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive use of specific complex phrases ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") which appear three times each in a short space, creating a mechanical template cadence. While the rhythm is generally smooth, these repetition artifacts disrupt the immersion and feel like forced insertions rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetition of specific phrases ("patiently nimble" twice, "agreed upon lies" three times, "interrogate" three times) creates a stuttering effect in such a short text. The second use of "patiently nimble" is abstract and reads like a forced constraint insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    A distinct grammatical error ("skepticism a armor") undermines the polish. The text suffers from repetitive phrasing of prompt elements ("tragically radiant" used twice, "ghostly resolve" used twice) and overuse of specific adjectives ("velvet"). The density of modifiers occasionally clogs the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is heavily marred by the mechanical repetition of multi-word phrases ("heritage rose thorn," "stalactites dripped," "key with no apparent lock") which appear 3-4 times each in a short space. These text artifacts create a checklist-like rhythm that breaks immersion and signals a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft shows strong sensory control and rhythmic sentence structure ("hummed... a vibration she felt in her teeth"). However, the "scaffold" visibility of required elements creates distinct prose artifacts that mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("voice like cracking ice," "tear tracks") and abstract telling ("wove truth carefully"). Adjective-heavy descriptions occasionally stall the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but marred by the clumsy repetition of complex phrases ("scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" both appear twice), creating a "parrot" effect. These insertions break the narrative flow and feel like unchecked prompt adherence rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "screaming mouth... storms screaming" in the same sentence) and the triple use of the awkward "sharply observant" tag. The prose frequently summarizes key moments that should be scenes, reducing immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally excellent, dense with imagery and rhythmically controlled. A few moments lean toward adjectival stacking ("stormlit," "cobalt," "fragmented"), and the simile "thin as rice paper" is slightly generic compared to the otherwise fresh imagery (e.g., "grit in a gear").

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is marred by the forced inclusion of prompt phrases ("positively wistful joy that stung like honey" is a confused image). The repetition of specific phrases like "feral loft" and "lonesome splendor" within a short space creates noticeable redundancy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is frequently overwrought, relying on adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset," "complex patterns") and abstract technical jargon ("vibrational signature," "logarithmic calculation") that slows momentum. The "fleshly ethereal" phrase reads as a forced insertion rather than a natural description.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The awkward phrase "softly purposeful" appears three times (paras 2, 6, 9), creating a significant repetitive artifact that feels mechanical and ungrammatical in two instances. This loop, combined with heavy adjectival phrasing, lowers the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally competent but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases that disrupt syntax and logic (e.g., "fortified vulnerability manifesting as deliberate breaths"). Additionally, phrase repetition ("recognized... recognition") and abstract noun clusters ("cascade of entangled memories") reduce line-level momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant text artifacts lower the score: the distinct phrases "aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush" are each used twice in a short space, creating a jarring, repetitive echo. Phrases like "violet desperation" and "irrefutable as gravity" read as strained or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and dense ("language that tasted like copper"), but the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("steadily curious," "throughout the evolution") creates a noticeable scaffold effect that disrupts the rhythm and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetition of prompt phrases ("brightly attentive," "sensed absence") creates noticeable text artifacts that disrupt the flow. The prose tends toward "telling" rather than "showing," especially in the resolution of the cold case.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and imagery-rich, creating a strong sensory experience, though it occasionally lapses into overwriting ("dying giants," "sickly greens"). The text avoids mechanical loops but relies heavily on adjectives and metaphors that sometimes crowd the sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric ("specific frequency of finality"), maintaining high density. A few images, like bergs groaning "like old men," feel slightly standard compared to the otherwise fresh specificities, and the "filigree tattoo" is borderline overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with modifiers ("exhaled its diesel sigh"), and the integration of prompt phrases creates clunky, meta-commentary sentences ("drawing parallels between viticulture and heartbreak"). The academic diction clashes violently with the sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers severely from "text artifact" looping, specifically the verbatim repetition of long phrases (e.g., "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" five times in a short text). While sentence rhythm is otherwise functional, these static insertions create a template-like cadence that stalls momentum and obscures craft.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but leans on abstractions ("invisible architecture of collective grief") and awkward prompt-word insertions ("perceptively calm"). The phrasing is often passive or explanatory, reducing the density of active storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the imagery is evocative, the prose suffers from the conspicuous repetition of prompt phrases ("sonically reflective," "fractured sequences") which appear twice in a short span, creating a mechanical feel. Some descriptions verge on "purple" ("pregnant, a held breath"), reducing line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("videotape silence pressing against his eardrums"). A minor deduction only for the slightly generic shorthand of "musical notations and logarithmic spirals" to describe the sound, but the overall craft is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("light pressing against the walls like water"). There is a tendency toward overwriting in emotional beats ("luminous ache," "audible grace"), and the metaphor of light as weight/water is poetic but physically muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts, looping specific prompt phrases ("hymning the mundane," "scent of hope," "pulsing stillness") multiple times within a short space. This repetition creates a checklist effect that breaks immersion. Additionally, some metaphors are imprecise (enzymes "flatlining" is medically awkward) or cliché ("guilt hanging... like static").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative, successfully balancing the surreal premise with concrete physical action ("teeth clicking," "water-damaged logs"). While generally strong, the phrasing "moved quietly deliberate" acts as a minor stumble in an otherwise smooth flow.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is generally strong, but there are text artifacts like the repetition of "shrewdly innocent" and scaffolded explanations of metaphors. Phrases like "cleft in certainty" lean toward purple prose, slightly obscuring the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm but leans heavily into "purple" description ("zephyr bloom of dawn-star light," "serpentine grotto," "conflagration"). While evocative, the adjective density occasionally slows momentum and feels ornamental rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is generally polished, the integration of required phrases is syntactically clumsy (e.g., "Winter had carved a pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" reads awkwardly). Additionally, the repetition of distinct labels like "quietly proactive" and "honeyed hush" exposes the scaffolding, breaking the immersive quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from the forced repetition of multi-word phrases ("swirling hush," "against the current") which creates a stuttering rhythm. Phrases like "watched, lucidly watchful" (tautology) and "arranged the ephemeral cameo appearances" (abstraction error) harm line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density ("narrative and nitrogen" is a standout). While generally strong, the sentence structures occasionally fall into a repetitive cadence that dampens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and rich, though occasionally overwrought with dense metaphor ("atmosphere itself had forgotten how to exhale") that slows propulsion. The line-level craft is high, but the heavy reliance on personification and adjectival phrasing borders on purple in the descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.3)
    Major repetition issues stifle momentum: "wounded season" (3x), "store wonder..." (3x), and "reverse-engineer" (3x) create a stagnant loop. The prose often prioritizes purple descriptors ("copper corpse") over active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically strong but marred by the clumsy adverb construction "boundary-lessly" and repetitive use of "fractal" (weaver, depths, edges). Sensory density is high, but synonym churn around "sorrow/grief/burden" reduces precision.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the rhythm is generally good, the text suffers from repetitive lexical artifacts. The word "crystallized" appears four times to describe time/rain, and the phrase "hauntingly practical" is repeated as a descriptor, signaling a lack of line-level scrubbing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong with striking imagery ("lullaby dissolved into static"), but suffers occasionally from adjectival stacking and abstract noun phrases ("temporal dissonance," "fractured stillness") that create distance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but frequently slips into abstraction ("mathematically precise silence") and metaphorical summary that glosses over the mechanics of the scene. While the imagery is strong, the reliance on high-level descriptors blunts the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from "text artifacts" and repetitive loops; specific complex phrases ("crystal whispering forecourt," "glacial hush," "excruciatingly gentle," "petrichor nostalgia") appear 3–4 times each in a short space. This creates a mechanical, template-like cadence that disrupts the natural flow and highlights the artificiality of the prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("thoughtfully clear" and "silence of morning radio" both appear twice) and forced prompt insertions. The phrase "thoughtfully clear" is used awkwardly as an adverbial construction ("fell thoughtfully clear"), disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("weathered to the color of bone"). There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("Elias saw," "Elias knew") and some adjectival phrasing that slows momentum. However, the line-level craft is generally strong and supports the hushed tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid imagery is hampered by adjective-heavy phrasing ("vividly descriptive crimson rush") and prompt artifacts that disrupt the rhythm. While the flow is generally good, the reliance on modifiers and the awkward integration of required phrases weaken the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.8)
    While some imagery is vivid ("thunder wrapped in silk"), the prose suffers from severe artifact loops; distinct phrases are repeated verbatim three times each in a short space (e.g., "hypothesizing about everything"). This constitutes a critical failure in the "Template-cadence check" and "Loop/Scaffold Screen."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive looping of specific phrases ("gracefully alert" x2, "migration of clouds" x3, "kelp-drift peace" x2) which read as forced insertions. Additionally, the density of mixed metaphors ("atmosphere into silver silence," "scars can sing") creates opacity that stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is overwritten in places, with mixed metaphors ("doubt radiating... as a searching light") and clunky constructions forced to accommodate prompt words ("unstick the mystery"). These artifacts draw attention to the writing process and obscure the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is significantly overwritten, with figurative language saturating nearly every sentence ("black veins of shame," "rot within a rose," "wept radiation"). This high density of metaphor slows momentum and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. While grammatically clean, the text suffers from a lack of breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    The phrase "thundering calm" (or variations) is repeated four times in a short space, creating a distracting scaffold artifact rather than a rhythmic anchor. The prose is overwritten, with high metaphor density ("sun bled violet") that clogs momentum. Filter verbs ("Elias saw," "Elias understood") frequently rob scenes of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is weighted down by significant repetitive tagging of prompt elements. "Broken rake handle" appears four times and "obsidian ridge" three times in a short space, creating a scaffolded feel that disrupts flow. Phrases like "searing reverie" feel inserted rather than organic, and describing "microscopic grooves" felt by a thumb on wood strains sensory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is heavily marred by the verbatim repetition of distinct phrases ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes," "tenderly organized," "chess clock") within a very short word count. These "text artifacts" break immersion, making the story read like a checklist execution rather than a fluid narrative. The repetition dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from overwriting and abstraction (e.g., "distilled essence of questions"). The reliance on metaphorical summary over concrete action slows momentum, though the "kingfisher" imagery provides some necessary sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is modifier-heavy ("brittle paper," "peculiar must," "sharpest trumpet") and relies on abstract metaphors ("archaeology of breath") that border on purple. While the rhythm is smooth, the density of adjectives and "writing about writing" imagery reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the baseline prose is evocative, the text suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("incomplete information," "weaved truth," "mirage of safety," "crystallize a fleeting emotion") multiple times each. This creates a severe scaffold artifact, reading like a checklist rather than organic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, successfully carrying the weight of the introspection with high information density. While the structural repetition of "abrasive calm" and "wannabe philosopher" serves as a bookend, the verbatim reuse of these prompt phrases in a short space feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    The text suffers from severe artifacting, specifically the verbatim repetition of unique, complex phrases ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "across unlearning hatred") within a short space. Additionally, clumsy phrasing like "Across unlearning hatred" and adjective stacking clutter the prose and disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant deduction for repetitive artifacting; the phrases "informally wise" and "synaptic plasticity" each appear three times in a short text, creating a robotic template cadence. The prose oscillates between evocative sensory imagery and clunky expository sentences ("process was physiological and spiritual"). These repetitions stall momentum and highlight the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level description is often beautiful ("sticking to the amber resin"), but the thrice-repeated "nectar dusk" and the didactic dialogue stall momentum. The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought, prioritizing poetic effect over narrative efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but dense with adjectives and slightly strained metaphors ("streetlights daydreamed," "grammar of rearrangement"). While the imagery is evocative, the reliance on abstraction ("fragment of primordial stillness") reduces immediate physical grounding in the key scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rich and evocative, but the specific phrase "incisively kind" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, some metaphor clusters ("bioluminescent plankton awakened in chains of logic") feel slightly overwrought and mixed.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("white tooth broken by time"). However, "balancedly daring" is an awkward construction that disrupts the flow, and phrases like "engine of stone and sorrow" lean slightly purple. The "coefficient of regret" metaphor is creative but risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from noticeable repetitive phrasing ("constellation," "saffron quiet," "moon-tipped brush," and "methodically hopeful" each appear twice in a short space). The usage "worked methodically hopeful" is grammatically awkward and reads as a forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from lexical repetition and a tendency toward adjectival density ("damp limestone," "damp air," "damp dread"; "rosewater dread," "rosewater-scented"). The phrase "rosewater dread" appears as a label rather than an evoked feeling, and the repetition of "dread" weakens the emotional impact. The sentence rhythm is often slow and heavy, matching the atmosphere but dragging the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally capable but suffers from severe artifacting due to the clumsy repetition of specific descriptors ("neatly inventive" appears three times; "bleak exhilaration" twice). These loops degrade the reading experience and obscure the story's otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-dense, successfully integrating prompt-mandated phrasing like "unbosom" without breaking flow. Some descriptions border on purple ("repulsive allure," "morbid artistic precision"), but the sensory details generally land with visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant deduction for text artifacts: complex prompt phrases ("restless euphony," "fractal generating," "sketched resonance") are repeated 3–4 times each in a short space, creating a looped, mechanical cadence. This repetition creates a "synonym churn" effect that stalls momentum and obscures the prose's natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("calcified backs," "bleaching everything white and gold"). A few moments lean into "telling" via abstract nouns ("geometry made audible") rather than concrete sensory details, but the style generally supports the story's mathematical mysticism well.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but marred by the forced repetition of the phrase "emotionally rational" (three times), which reads as a clumsy prompt insertion. These artifacts, combined with dense explanatory clauses, slow the narrative momentum and disrupt the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished but overwrought ("iron finality," "hushed blaze"), with a high density of adjectives. Several prompt elements are inserted as literal phrases, disrupting the organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Phrase insertions ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive awareness") create semantic awkwardness that disrupts flow and meaning. The prose tends toward adjective stacking ("water-warped spines," "antique ink stamp") which slows momentum without adding necessary precision.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("pooling... like spilled ink"), but the prose suffers from repetitive phrasing of the "descending while ascending" motif. The final paragraph relies on abstract pairings ("burial and a birth") that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally strong and dense, but the forced inclusion of specific prompt phrases results in clunky modifications ("intangibly tangible weight"). The technical descriptions occasionally drift into jargon without sufficient clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is polished but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and repetition (the phrase "brilliant dimness" appears twice as a descriptor). Clichés like "fingers trembled" and "sun bled" detract from the otherwise solid imagery. The sentence rhythm is stately but monotonous, lacking variation to match the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Significant lexical loops mar the prose; "cobalt" appears three times, and both "sieved hush" and "weight of unspoken words" repeat verbatim. These repetitions, alongside the forced insertion of prompt phrases, create a "checklist" texture that disrupts the rhythm and suggests a limited vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. A few metaphors lean toward the abstract ("pendulum between apology and forgiveness," "furrowed hush"), which slightly diffuses the physical immediacy of the scene, but the line-level craft is otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a few standard metaphors ("hit him in waves," "shark scenting blood"). The prompt phrases are integrated grammatically but stand out as "literary" insertions that disrupt the natural rhythm of the character's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The phrase &quot;delicately robust&quot; is repeated three times (ball, leather, legs), reading as a forced prompt insertion that creates a distracting text artifact. Heavy reliance on filter verbs (&quot;Mara understood,&quot; &quot;Mara recognized&quot;) creates distance during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is lush and descriptive but suffers from occasional purple phrasing ("lodged directly in the soul"). The awkward phrasing of "fortune from cookie" creates a jarring mechanical artifact in the opening and closing. The rhythm is generally good, but the density of adjectives sometimes slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally heavy with adjectival modification ("onyx-ink," "fractured starlight," "eternal grass"). The integration of the awkward required phrase "dolls' tea set saucer crack" is handled syntactically well, though the density of imagery slows momentum slightly in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from occasional "purple" phrasing ("cathedral of rust and regret") and redundancies ("ghostly resolve—that haunting determination"). The rhythm is steady, though some sentences are dense with abstract descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies, relying on clichés ("pregnant with imminent change," "fingers of wind") and abstract noun phrases. Rhythmic parallelism ("sand becoming glass, wealth becoming wisdom") creates a template cadence that feels artificial and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of distinctive prompt phrases ("calmly inventive," "winking hush") in close proximity. These obvious artifacts break immersion and suggest a checklist approach rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("shadows that fell upward"), though it occasionally slips into adjectival stacking or list-based description ("fractal, recursive, beautiful") that dilutes the immediacy of the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose suffers from significant lexical repetition ("rarefied" x3, "storm-kissed" x2, "furiously tranquil" x2) and a high density of "Abstract Noun of Abstract Noun" metaphors ("cartography of scars," "architecture of survival"). This density obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.6)
    While polished, the prose suffers from "purple" tendencies (e.g., "indifferent commentary on human urgency") and creates distraction by repeating specific prompt phrases verbatim ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos") in close proximity, which feels like a checklist rather than organic drafting.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The text suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," "forge beauty from anarchy") multiple times within a short space. This redundancy acts as a text artifact that disrupts the narrative flow and makes the prose feel scaffolded rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from lexical loops, repeating "flickering compasses" five times and "broken anniversary clock" three times within a short word count. While the sentence rhythm is generally good, this mechanical repetition of prompt keywords creates a checklist-like effect that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished with strong imagery, though the repetition of the phrase "empirically whimsical" feels slightly mechanical. A reliance on filter verbs ("understood," "realized," "knew") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract genitive constructions ("tides of remembrance," "illusion of perpetual movement") and overt explanations of metaphors that stall momentum. The triple use of "rhythmically placid" constitutes a significant repetitive artifact, and the density of adjectives suffocates the nouns, resulting in a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with purposeful ascent/descent refrain; figurative layering coherent in lyric mode, no loops, though peak beats border overwriting without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful figurative lattice (geode matching perturbations); minor paraphrase loops ("unused potential pools," "intangibly tangible") in reflective beats dull momentum slightly, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chip description advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm survives read-aloud without loops or scaffolds; figurative density coherent in cosmic motif, no muddle touching closure despite occasional elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands raw from salt and splinters" advances action/embodiment); purposeful "weight" recurrence taught early avoids loops; minor fig lang density in opener contained, propulsion clear to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "coat snapping like a flag of truce in the gale" advances voice/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked figures during exchange ("pendulum between apology and forgiveness") risks coherence but pattern-taught. No loops; closure image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies with scene (short strokes in surf, longer reflection post-beach); minor density slip in stacked metaphors ("waves...shark...wet sail") early but purposeful for texture, no loops dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with purposeful lyricism, but minor overwriting in repeated "delicately robust" motif slightly dulls propulsion before lake climax; rhythm varies effectively, closure image clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "aromas of cinnamon and nebula dust... lodged directly in the soul" advances sensory, plot, theme); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density in multi-job lines like saucer glow integrates action and image; minor metaphor density purposeful without muddle or loops in peak unfastening.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    High-density imagery propels via taught stitching/tears pattern; no loops, varied rhythm sustains clarity through climax without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in release beats (e.g., "light-poetry that spelled out words in extinct languages," "microscopic gears") risks coherence without full pattern payoff (−0.6); no loops, rhythm varies.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dense, propulsive sentences vary rhythm but figurative density in peak beats ("heartbeat of the coming change") risks overwriting (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "calmly inventive" reprises). High info density integrates action/image cleanly overall.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density, varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; propulsion strong in climax ("Star dust swirled around him, stinging where it touched"). Minor figurative density ("shadows that fell upward") risks slight muddle in peak beat but doesn't obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with purposeful figurative pattern (chemical darkness, emulsion) propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting density in writing beat ("furiously tranquil" reprise, "rarefied" echoes) slightly dulls propulsion without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density, propulsion via varied syntax in duel beats; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrites in metaphors ("fractured prism," "compass points") but purposeful, not muddled. Closure image clear.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tapped the coffee tin" advances plot/character/object). Minor paraphrase loops in "rebuilding" motif (books/world) purposeful under textural lens, no scaffold. Slight overwriting in metaphors like "blooming resistance" near end dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor climax metaphor density ("sky bruised purple") coherent but borders overwriting without obscuring image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "roots sought specific mineral veins, downloading centuries"). Minor figurative density in bloom descriptions purposeful/consistent, no muddle or loops touching closure. Rhythm varies, closure image sharp ("branches already heavy with unripe fruit").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with rhythmic propulsion varying sentence lengths; purposeful metaphor coherence (silt, waves, diffusion) without muddle, though minor repetitive phrasing ("rhythmically placid") risks template feel but serves voice-motivated pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric rhythm serves theme—long sentences swell like floodwater, then settle into shorter sedimentary beats. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical (dust = equations, moisture = dark matter). Two adjacent sentences paraphrase “gradual change” idea; minor −0.2. Strong information density: one sentence often performs description, emotion, and causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops, zero scaffolding; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors (“red stone into something pale and lunar”) are precise, not mixed. High information density: “brittle edge of the charcoal smuggler’s ledger strip” fuses object, history, and tactile quality in nine words. Opening and closing lines book-end with fire/ash imagery, creating propulsive symmetry. No artifact touches the closure beat; the final clause “stars still burning in her mind” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences paint fork, breath, color, and emotional valence. Metaphors are coherent—“frost flowers,” “phantom limbs”—and never stacked. Rhythm accelerates with ascending scale, then releases on low-A crescendo. One paraphrase loop (“silence itself possessed texture and temperature and weight”) is minor; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: every clause advances image or stakes—“vaulted corridors where books floated like schools of silver fish, their pages inscribed with names instead of stories” does triple metaphorical, world-building, and thematic work. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent within water-light-shelf lexicon. One mixed vehicle: “library was a lighthouse” is abstract until the lens-click literalizes it, but the closure beat justifies the stretch. Opening line anchors insomnia and crate; closing line resolves with sand and sleep, satisfying ear-test symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no filter-verb stacks. High density: one clause often fuses action, setting, and emotional charge (“she left his insulin…exactly where the terra-cotta met the crumbling mortar”). One loop risk—“midnight food runs” is repeated thrice in 100 words mid-story—barely avoids −0.3. No mixed metaphors; figurative language recedes during the climactic bell strike, letting the sound itself land.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, emotion, myth—without overcrowding: “wisteria that had drunk the tears” compresses time and botany. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory angle. Metaphor vehicles (pollen, capillary, bellows) stay coherent under physical logic. A single purple patch—“vault where affection never spent calcified into grief”—survives because it’s immediately tested by the tear’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual angle. Metaphors are botanically coherent—“crystallized light,” “chemical emulsions surrendering to entropy”—and never mixed. Density high: one sentence often does exposition + image + emotional tilt (“The air itself seemed to quake with reverie”). Closure sentence is pristine: “beautifully disintegrating” condenses theme, tone, and cost without extra weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Dust settled through the broken skylights onto shelves of forgotten stuffed animals” seeds both atmosphere and the later sunlight payoff. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or causality. Metaphors are sparse, coherent—“chain like a living gate” extends logically to her stance. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaks mirror beat shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; high information density—“compressed silence gathered from empty rooms” does double work. One paraphrase loop spotted (“she heard… she heard…”) mid-scene, minor enough to keep below artifact cap. No figurative muddle in peak beat; closure image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose modulates rhythm to task—swift, tactile for the lift; longer, luminous for the balcony recognition—without paraphrase loops; mixed metaphors kept in check (“heart…fist…destiny’s door”) and stacked figuratives serve density rather than ornament, sustaining momentum to the final moonlit line.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“fragile grammar of drips and cracks”—never clusters in high-pressure beats. Information density is high: each sentence layers glass craft, meteorology, or emotional stance. Minor scaffold: “she was exactly where the thawing heart needed her to be” is slightly abstract, but it does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “They knelt, their acrophobia making the stars above seem like a crushing weight” fuses action, perception, metaphor in one sweep. No loops or scaffold; figurative language sparse, pattern-taught (“skeletal fingers”), paid off. Rhythm accelerates at confrontation, breathes at exit. Clean grammar, precise pronouns, strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sibilant sentences for viscous quiet, staccato fragments when pebbles click. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful, never muddling causality. One scaffold loop (“the ___ hush” intro) is intentional motif, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Figurative layering is disciplined: each crystalline image returns transformed—tiles → violin → proofs → ladder. No mixed metaphors; “captured whisper” is exact. Occasional noun-phrase apposition drags (“the janitor it was with the musician it had been…”) but the final clause crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm mirrors dripping—sentence length varies, no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence can layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work (“crystal whispering forecourt…after words become unnecessary”). Minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood now that transparency…”) but erased by immediacy of final image. No mixed metaphors; lens logic stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density; most sentences dual-load image and emotion. One mixed-metaphor cluster (“river deltas or veins of an ancient hand”) slightly blurs peak beat. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid overwrite. One mixed metaphor (“thickens the air itself into something measurable and dense”) but it is brief and early. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Final line cadence perfectly mirrors sideways glide of time. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally: longer lyrical openings contract to percussive fragments (“She raised her bow”). Figurative language is selective—two metaphors per beat at peak—avoiding purple overlay. No synonym loops or template cadence; each water image serves distinct causal or sensory work. One minor scaffold: “the silence possessed a texture she had never encountered” could trim “she had,” but momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from 5-word pulses to 40-word fever-washes; no template cadence. Density high—“hollowed and luminous in the auroral sorrow” performs character, tone, time in one breath. Only one soft paraphrase loop (“swallowed the readings whole… swallowed these truths”) but repetition is thematic glue, not scaffold. Mixed metaphors (“finger pointing toward the margins,” “vessel at sea”) read as fever residue, justified by POV.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High information density: soot-blackened bricks, chemical sludge, sixteen colors each carry double duty. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor—“spine of some buried leviathan”—is permissible and taught early. Final third is clean; no artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense but patterned; repetition (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “regenerative silence”) functions as mantra, taught by 25% mark and paid off. Some sentences carry triple duty (image, theme, sensory anchor). Minor loop: “microscopic increments” is echoed immediately; does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors; river and paper logics stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose shows high density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, emotional calibration, and environmental response. Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—"water finding cracks in stone" beside "filament of sound"—but physical logic holds. Zero loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Final line earns rhythmic echo of opening.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is high-density with no loops or scaffold; figurative language (“dragons coiled around a tree that bore fruit like stars”) is selective and paid off. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—long reflective sentences, then staccato “She pressed her palm.” No mixed metaphors or register drift under peak pressure. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences do two jobs (“inserting the microdot into the dough” advances plot while sustaining metaphor). One paraphrase loop: “he had orchestrated…he had modulated” repeats the same claim within four lines. Mixed-metaphor risk—“transpose life into a new key” beside “tide pools filling with moonlight”—stays coherent because both images orbit cycles and reflection. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold; final paragraph earns its crescendo without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from incense-long to staccato interrogatives, propelling the ritual tempo. Figurative language is selective—"incense smoke," "rotted silk"—never clogging high-pressure beats. No synonym loops; each pedal iteration adds denotation. Grammar clean; line-level artifacts absent even at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate crescendo-decrescendo; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative density is high but each metaphor (ice as staff line, breath as silent notes) is returned to and physically activated, so none feel decorative. The single over-ripe phrase—“disease of the soul”—is forgiven because it is immediately re-grounded in shell geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is exuberant: stacked metaphors (“cartography of fractured timelines”) risk purple but maintain internal consistency. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory angle or conceptual turn. Occasional abstraction (“impossible structure”) slightly dulls immediacy mid-paragraph, yet momentum survives. Closing image is crisp, letting the viaduct fade without verbal overkill.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates from long, lung-filled sentences to the staccato of “each rotation backward stripping away another layer,” matching the phonograph’s deceleration. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor cluster—“architecture of anticipation…pooled like water in cupped hands”—stops short of cluttering the closure beat. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative layering (“shadows pooled like ink”) stays purposeful. One scaffold loop: “lateral evasion that mirrored how storm systems circumvent…” restated twice. No artifact touches closure; rhythm modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density; most sentences advance at least two tasks. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“crystal shadows” links lantern, vial, tear-light). One minor paraphrase loop on “extinct…extinction” but not in closure beat. Strong verbs outweigh modifiers. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts purposeful. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Artifacts do not touch final image; eligible for 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    High figurative density is justified because the piece is a lyric accumulative text; metaphors stay coherent (fraying = temporal texture). One paraphrase loop detected (“time itself had texture… texture of time”) but it occurs early and is later conceptually repriced, so the closure beat remains sharp. Otherwise zero scaffold, strong propulsion, and vivid nouns/verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses build drone, then fracture into shorter beats as flames lower. Information density is high—each sentence advances image, character, or acoustics. Figurative logic stays coherent (sound as liquid, silence as ice) without mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop—"magnificent simplicity" repeated—dulls the edge slightly, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence layering scent, charge, and metamorphosis. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is controlled to three sharp images per beat. Opening and closing lines bookend with amber breath/pulse, creating cadence frame. Minor filter verb (“Kael felt it as…”) does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propel without scaffold, and carry double duty (information + atmosphere); only minor purple flecks (“meteor dust,” “tempest-tossed”) slightly over-decorate an otherwise clean, propulsive line.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive: “fruit hung like frozen starlight” carries three jobs—visual, tonal, stakes. No loops or filter-verb stacks; each sentence advances shelter, water, bridge. One mixed metaphor (“webs…crystallized”) appears mid-story but is purified into the final bridge image, so closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well; long lyrical coils contract into staccato observations at climax. Metaphors occasionally stack three-deep (“crystalline bridge…shimmering like heat…”) risking momentary purple haze, but physical logic holds. No paraphrase loops; pronouns and tense clean. Opening line efficiently anchors voice and wonder; closing line (“searching for what the world had caged”) offers circular resonance without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Information density high: “dovetail joint formed in his understanding” fuses carpentry + emotion in one line. Minor scaffold: “the mathematics of emotion had become his obsession” tells what prior beats already show (−0.3). Closure image untouched by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Figurative language dense but pattern-taught early (“metallic insects,” “arteries beneath the reading rooms”) and paid off. Minor scaffold: “she remembered why she had begun this work” could be cut without loss. Information density high—each sentence advances cache logic or memory theme. No mixed metaphors; closure line crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are disciplined—“viscous and electric” air, “something viscous and electric”—and never mixed. Information density high: one sentence often performs sensory anchoring, interior tilt, and foreshadowing (e.g., storm dripping carries weight of failed hypothesis). No scaffold sentences; final line cadence mirrors opening humidity, closing the sonic ring.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense but breathable: figurative layering (“salt ate her canvases”) is sparse enough to avoid purple clusters. One paraphrase loop (“water gives and the water takes” echoing earlier tide refrain) is purposeful tribal idiom, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines act as resonant bookends. Minor filter-stack in “she understood now that…” but occurs in reflective beat, not under peak pressure. Closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tension—long sentences swell during harmonic swells, fragment when vision blanks. Figurative language is patterned (“silver laughter”) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “humming…cave” twice in 50 words;不足以触碰closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is tidal—sentence lengths swell and ebb without mechanical pattern. Information density high: “ivory harbor after rain” packs color, texture, and era. Occasional scaffold: “compile fragments into meaning” recurs four times, each slightly reshaped, but the repetition edges mantra. Metaphors stay coherent (bones, cartography) and never collide.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences carry dual duty (image + character worldview). Two adjacent paraphrase loops (“silences accumulated like sediment… the explanation for her sister’s silence”) create mild echo. Mixed metaphors are avoided; constellation / crack / ticket punch form a coherent visual spine. Closure line (“some routes can only be drawn by walking them”) is elegant but leans aphoristic, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong density—most sentences couple sensory data with emotional tilt. One scaffold loop: “she had worked…she believed…she remained” opens three adjacent sentences, creating template cadence, but it stops before the climax. Mixed metaphors avoided; comet “trailing” and stone “humming” coexist cleanly. Final third is artifact-free; no figurative muddle touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from languid cumulative openings to fragmented peak (“The fragment shattered...”). Metaphors stay consistent—light, folding, magnetics—no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“spatial disobedience,” “Euclidean logic”) is voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop (“spatial mutiny...rebellious space”) but not at closure; no scaffold artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-density lines carry simultaneous sensory and metaphorical load without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; “liquefied rigid thinking” returns only to reweight stakes. Figurative logic stays coherent—ink as both signature and solvent—through peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or stakes. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “roots like frozen lightning” remains physically coherent within miniature scale. Information density high—single clause often layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Rhythm breathes with pressure peaks; no overwriting despite sustained lyricism. Copy-clean; pronouns track flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    High信息 density; most lines twin sensory image with conceptual weight (“the way rust layers upon metal”). Figurative runs are patterned early and justified by synesthetic lens—no clutter. One scaffold trace: “layer upon layer, tide after tide” is deliberate accumulative cadence, not loop. Closing velvet metaphor crystallizes without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with musical cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. High density: glass “glittered like failed stars” does double atmospheric and thematic work. Minor scaffold: “reimagined…reimagined…” loop recycles without new info. No mixed metaphors; shell-cello-fog triad maintains coherent physical logic. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty (paint chip scores glyph + reveals resolve) with natural cadence shifts. Metaphors are precise: “music…a heartbeat before the scalpel,” “graffiti…like barnacles.” No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One clause (“threatening and buoyant all at once”) momentarily abstracts tide water simile, a hair below seamless. Otherwise clean mechanics propel to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence fuses temperature, visor glare, and moral stance. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent—“cathedral of gold and obsidian” extends lighting effect without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts precise. Final clause “dawnlit melancholy” is earned compression, not purple. Zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; figurative language is spare, avoiding density creep. Information density high: basin, alloy, sinew, tone all carry dual jobs. Minor scaffold: “the sound resonated through the depot’s iron beams” restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors or loop artifacts in peak beats; propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—lines twin sensory detail with method revelation (“condensation bloom…mirrored…tributary systems”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato steps to final sustained image. Occasional adjective richness (“worrying tranquility,” “crystalline”) stays purposeful and pattern-taught; no clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long, breath-filled accumulations to abrupt stops that mimic footfall beats. Figurative language is dense but patterned—stone singing, mortar flowing—so the lyric excess feels motivated rather than ornamental. A few near-repeats (“infinitely patient” twice, “wild hush” echoed) slightly dull the final third, keeping the piece from pristine polish.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm modulates from long cadences of wonder to staccato crisis beats. Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with minimal scaffold. Two paraphrase loops (“lonesome splendor” echoed inside three sentences) and one filter-verb cluster (“she felt / she saw”) keep it from 8.5. No mixed metaphors; clarity survives peak pressure. Final line lands clean without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies, density high; imagery rarely repeats without purpose. Mixed-metaphor risk in “honey wrapped around broken glass” resolves through consistent caustic sweetness motif. Minor loop: “ephemeral cameo appearances” is stated twice in similar cadence; not fatal but keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies from tidal cadence to staccato breath; high information density—each sentence layers loom, tide, stone, or law. No scaffold sentences or synonym loops detected. One mixed metaphor risk—“the canyon shuddered... with relief”—strains physical logic but is brief and does not touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharp, the latter recharging mist rather than salt as new life.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence performs double duty—sensory anchor plus thematic nudge—while avoiding metaphor pile-up. No loops, paraphrase, or scaffold; nouns concrete (“razor-wire borders,” “brass compass”), verbs kinetic (“snake,” “drink up”). Rhythm modulates with discovery urgency; no monotony even in catalogue of relics. Clause order stays sequential, eliminating simultaneity errors. Line-level craft sustains clarity through peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence openings vary; high information density—“chrome girders of the golden arcade” does world, tone, and metaphor in five words. No loops or synonym churn; “clipboard felt lighter” recurs only to mark transferred burden, justified. One mixed metaphor hazard—“cathedral to tactile experience”—but saved by immediate concrete anchor. Filter verbs minimal and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences layer job—propulsion, atmosphere, and knowledge—without scaffolding; zero loops or synonym churn, metaphors stay coherent (“copper leaves fell in patterns that matched…footsteps”), and the final line varies cadence to crystallize the hush; no overwriting artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes—no scaffold, no synonym loops. Figurative layering (“moonlight pooled like mercury”) is sparse and purposeful; mixed-metaphor guardrails intact. Minor filter verb (“she watched her breath bloom”) is instantly redeemed by tactile next beat. Closure line is uncluttered, letting weep and moonlight resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She turned it over, considering how coral grafts onto dead reef skeletons” simultaneously advances metaphor and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; each image recurs with shifted charge (coral: found → warmed → sentinel). Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—no mixed physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges lotus motif. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with twilight descent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating cadence; clauses tighten as light-paint accelerates. Dense figurative language is purposeful—each metaphor performs exposure chemistry: “silver halides eager,” “alchemical marriage.” Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; props track (camera box, tin, film strips). Final beam “completing the exposure” is precise technical closure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and afterglow respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future acoustic effect, e.g., “tubular chimes” presage echoed chords. Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“question mark made of earth”) so closure rereads coherently. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“began to trace...began to bewitch”) slightly softens the climax, keeping it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary, no template runs. High density—“dried seeds whispering like contained secrets” does image + tone + foreshadowing in one stroke. Minor purple shimmer in “cathedral of glass” phrase, but it aligns with POV awe and never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with tidal variation; sentence openings avoid algorithmic drumbeat. Figurative language is dense but patterned—lullaby/wind/spiral—paid off when blossoms clog the entrance. No mixed metaphors; calcium logic stays coherent. One paraphrase loop detected (“centuries of longing” echoed twice) but does not touch closure; still caps 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is organic, pivoting from soft sibilance to clipped fracture when the tube snaps. Mixed metaphors are avoided: “sonic illumination” is physically coherent within the invented physics. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each image advances state or stakes. Opening and closing lines act as tuning forks, vibrating the same thematic frequency without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: “languages that had died specifically because its speakers had stopped speaking to one another” does world-and-theme work in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; figuratives are physics-sober. One paraphrase loop spotted (“cautious exuberance” twice in three lines) but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—each sentence advances tool, ethics, or atmosphere. Occasional stacked participles (“feeling each iron link settle…”) slightly gum urgency, but never within closure beat. No loops, no scaffold; read-aloud rhythm breathes with geothermal cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rust-red surface pulsing with impossible warmth” does triple sensory, symbolic, plot work. Rhythm varies from long reflective sentences to fragment beats at climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Zero artifact clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    High figurative density but pattern-taught early (prism refractions, spiral maps) and paid off at exit. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; information dual-loaded (light = map = memory). One scaffold risk: “necessary distances” nearly over-repeated in middle third, yet line remains varied. Closure image clean of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors (starlight fracturing, emerald fireflies) stay internally consistent. One paraphrase loop—“luminous respite” named twice within four lines—dims momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in strong verbs. Final paragraph’s cadence rises like ascent bubbles, cleanly closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene motion; sentences vary. Sparse scaffolding—only “cheerful gloom” echoed thrice. No mixed metaphors or filter stacks; minor template cadence in “before memory fades” refrain (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—almost every sentence moves plot, reveals motive, or textures world; no scaffold loops. Figurative language disciplined: “starlight to pool,” “gray falling from her shoulders” sharpen without purple drift. Occasional elevated diction (“mitre,” “coefficients”) fits Kael’s lexicon and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“She ground the moonstone cabochon dust speck between her fingers, mixing it with the saline tears she saved in a vial beneath her tongue”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the same cosmic-skin conceit. Tiny scaffold: repeated noun-phrase “moonstone cabochon dust speck” could be pruned to “moon dust” twice for propulsion. Closure line is clean, legible, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety supports tidal rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language clustered in descriptive paragraphs, not during decision beat, so density rule waived. Opening “horizon still bled violet into grey” anchors time and mood without purple overload. One paraphrase loop: “patterns… patterns” across adjacent clauses costs −0.2; otherwise clean, propulsive, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but purposeful—“ash of the Blackwood fire” packs origin, color, and history. Mixed metaphors are few and functional (“constellations that rivaled the stars” is POV-justified). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “universal language”) is earned by context, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she watched”) dull immediacy. Metaphors stay coherent; no loops or mixed vehicles near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the silent listening beats then widening for sunset reflection. Occasional modifiers (“ivy-veiled,” “moldy darkness”) are purposeful; no metaphor pile-ups or mixed vehicles. A single paraphrase loop—“walls remember…walls had witnessed…walls dream”—is motif-driven and taught early, so loop penalty waived; clarity at closure stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes while feeding atmosphere (“sunset fractured… casting spectral ladders”). Figurative language is dense but patterned, justified by painter POV; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop—“possibilities… possibilities”—in closing paragraph, minor enough to keep propulsion. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs dominate. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates cleanly toward bell-stroke finale, no algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences pull double duty: “boots grinding against limestone worn smooth by centuries of failed diplomacy” situates body, history, theme in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent—celestial dance, shared shadows, intertwined roots—without mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory layer. Final line cadence mirrors planetary drift, ear-tested aloud for weight.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences multitask: “The manufactured drought had done its work perfectly, exposing the old riverbeds that spider-webbed across the flat” advances plot, sets geography, foreshadows wing shape. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (mirror, bruise, cathedral) stay consistent to glass/reflection pattern. Strong verbs (“crunching,” “nestling,” “relinquishing”) propel. Final line lands with echoic consonance without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—description braided with stakes: “each gesture bodily poetic and deliberate” advances both image and key-mechanic. Figurative density is high yet patterned, taught by the courtyard sonnet and justified by prism refraction. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; clarity stays intact through fourth-dimensional sleight. A single near-purple phrase—“world of monochrome radiance”—is the lone hairline slip keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances image or moral physics (“signals that bounced off empty skies”). No loops, no scaffold; metaphor is coherent (stick as antenna-bone, smoke as reversed broadcast). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for dome expanse, staccato for fire crackle—without algorithmic pattern. Minor overgrowth: “half-lit epiphanies” appears twice; second use feels tagged rather than earned, but it lands inside closure so the blemish is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors monarch flutter—long inhalations, clipped exhalations; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative layer is dense but purposeful, never obscuring causality; chitin, reed, and silk carry tactile specificity without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line craft is dense yet aerated: “the snowmelt ardor had thawed the glaciers in her chest” fuses metaphor and emotion without purple drift. Figurative logic stays coherent—light, bronze, ice, rope all obey internal physics. No synonym loops; each sensory hit advances stakes or texture. Only hairline slip: “persistent and transformative” edges toward abstraction, but the next sentence re-grounds in tactile warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—“rust-eaten blast doors like praying hands”—and kept scarce enough to retain punch. One mixed micro-image (“electric green of after-storm”) is fleeting and does not touch closure. Density is high: single sentences fuse action, sensory filter, and thematic overtone.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density sentences carry triple duty: “tile…drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations” fuses sensory, metaphoric, plot function. Rhythm modulates from measured scholarly observation to incantatory list of integers. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances. One clause risks purple—“geometries older than crowns”—but earned by prior concrete mappings, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image, metaphor, and causality without paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shifting grace of neutrality”) is earned by earlier patterning and never clutters the climax. No mixed metaphors or register drift; “cellular memory” stays coherent as biological shorthand. Tiny hedge: the phrase “resentment given human form” borders on telling, but immediate embodiment via soldier-faces and gravity-warp keeps it marginal.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety propels without scaffold. Density high: one sentence often performs sight, memory, and tactical choice (“Using the antique knife, she pruned…”). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor paraphrase loop on “breach” (contract, human, wall) but occurs early and feeds motif, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and clause, propel without scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“brightened disquiet settled over her like dawn through stained glass”) are earned by voice and never clog causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—one sentence often maps botanical cipher onto spatial direction—while rhythm modulates from long cascading clauses to staccato stair-step fragments. Only a single mixed metaphor (“water in stone basins” beside amber light) nicks the peak beat, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but patterned and paid off; no mixed metaphors or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts—long clauses for drift, fragments for blinks. A single scaffold echo (“now it was...now it was”) is purposeful time-flutter, not artifact. Closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythmic variety: long atmospheric sentences contract to staccato braiding beats. Information density high—one sentence often layers gear sound, finger motion, temporal consequence. One mixed metaphor cluster: “cartographic key to such impossible cartography” is instant echo, forgiven in closure surge. Zero loops or scaffold; no artifact touches final line.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose propels: sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory texture). Mixed metaphors avoided; “ink in water” fits physical logic of expanding sphere. A few near-adjacent abstracts (“natural symphony,” “psychic shrieking”) mildly dilute density. High information load, no loops or scaffold, clean grammar, and final line cadence satisfy 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and musical—“light did not simply ignite; it unraveled outward in threads of gold”—yet avoids purple overload by keeping figurative language tied to the beacon’s function. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“shard of hush expanding outward until… hum surrendered”) is minor enough not to dull the closure image. Filter verbs are minimal; information is woven through action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates from long, cumulus sentences to staccato lightning fragments without drumbeat monotony. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful: every metaphor (pearl fog, silver sea, singing crystal) returns to charge the closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed vehicle—“stormlit clouds rotated in their eternal waltz”—slips toward cliché but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates with spiral tension; figuratives are selective, not stacked. One paraphrase loop (“filtering…through ambient awareness” twice inside 40 words) and a filter-verb cluster (“could feel…”) slightly dull immediacy at peak. Otherwise high-density, clean grammar, zero scaffold; final ash-hand image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each figurative image (star-salt, mirror-pool, green heart) recurs with accrued meaning rather than decoration. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, metaphor, and emotional pressure. Register never drifts into purple; “tidal-pool chronicler” is the most technical phrase and it’s justified. Closure line “the most honest transition period of all” risks thematic echo but is earned by prior concrete cycle imagery, barely slipping past artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do double duty: “She too must endure by limiting exposure” simultaneously states theme and foreshadows closure. Mixed-metaphor vigilance: “intangibly tangible” is repeated deliberately, taught early, paid off when the hush settles in sternum. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“stretching contracted rhythm” used twice) but it functions as motif beat, not churn. Final third is artifact-free, letting the porcelain-ear image land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Read-aloud cadence is purposeful; metaphors stay physical (prism, dendrites, velvet). High density—few filters, zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrase (“spectral ribbons”) allowed under lyrical licence; no clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “ruby flake embedded in her gloved palm pulsed” packs agent, object, location, motion in one clause. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—liquid crystal curtain, quantum superposition—taught early and paid off at collapse beat. One near-mixed metaphor: “memories surfacing from deep water” adjacent to orchard fruit, but the image stream stays legible and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “tissue interlocked like the teeth of ancient keys” does triple duty—tactile, auditory, mythic. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or texture. One mixed metaphor—“vacuum of absence” beside “lungs expand”—is forgiven because the body logic recovers in the scar-circuit. Final paragraph slows cadence to a controlled exhale, matching the thematic release.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences do double duty: “pressure could be alchemical” marries physics and metaphor in one breath. Figurative language is dense but coherent—every metaphor is pressure-tested against submarine physics and mycelial biology. Opening and closing lines are ear-perfect anchors. Minor micro-tautology “glow intensified…light…light” is the only detectable repetition, too small to touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long breathy accumulations to staccato revelations (“coordinates of mass graves”). Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is established as lyric mode, not overload. One scaffold loop: “each rotation…each oscillating mote…” repeats concept without new pressure. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences perform double duty: “mercury rising from the branches to form hovering spheres that reflected… his unlived lives” advances both image and stakes. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the alchemical logic. Filter verbs are absent; actions stay in the body. A single mixed vehicle—“liquid light that showed every threshold”—is minor, never obscures causality, and lands inside closure, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high—each sentence layers archival act, sensory detail, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective and paid off: dust as “strata” primes the closing “secret library” reconfiguration. No loops or scaffold; varied openings and paragraph lengths create organic rhythm. One minor strained metaphor—“fossilized creases”—but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and thematic echo in single strokes (“the lagoon itself recognized the phone booth key”). Metaphors are coherent and grounded in physics of light, water, metal. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; every clause advances. One mixed vehicle (“galaxy” collapsed into ceiling) is fleeting enough to keep the score below 9.0 but does not cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm ebbs and flows with respiratory beats; figurative language clusters only during low-tempo description, never when droplets threaten. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“sonorous absence”) momentarily lifts above saxophonist’s probable lexicon but reads as heightened perception under stress. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density high.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High information density—each sentence moves character, image, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; occasional modifiers (“wet, ancient joy”) are earned. One mixed metaphor cluster (“ribs becoming galleries for wind”) is vivid enough to pass. No artifacts touch the closure. Clean grammar and tense. Minor lexical elevation at “conceptual repricing” moment but justified by ecstatic transfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is almost pristine: high density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors stay physical (water’s “chaotic music,” ivy’s “vegetative reluctance”). Opening sentence anchors both vocation and worldview in 21 words; final line resolves by sonic image, not explanation. One microscopic stumble—“time itself could stall in a mechanism's wounded heart”—leans sentimental, but the wound is literalized two beats later when the chronometer restarts, so the metaphor earns its keep. No scaffolds, no synonym churn, no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: “rainwater evaporate from his golden scars” does triple atmospheric, tactile, and symbolic duty. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystallized final moment where options and stakes are made legible”) skirt over-articulation yet stay in-character. No filter-verb clusters, mixed metaphors, or loops obscure causality; sentence variety sustains momentum through a single night. One near-scaffold—“each equation glowing with phosphorescent certainty”—survives because it pays off in literal luminescence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: consonants clang like struck wire (“crackling like dry leaves,” “crystalline clarity”), yet no metaphor contradicts physical logic. Information density stays high—each sentence advances smoke-like sound, spectral bodies, or tactile cost. Minor scaffold in “the distorted harp sang its twisted song” (near-paraphrase) but the loop is isolated and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Figurative layering is dense yet pattern-taught: “silverware of her suffering” is earned because cutlery was never named before, so the metaphor carries fresh weight. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances either the geometric mapping of pain or the atmospheric charge toward the final equation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density—most sentences advance image or motive. Figurative language is patterned and taught early (“elusively tangible” refrain) so density cap waived. Two paraphrase loops (“anchors of intuition” repeated with no new angle) and one synonym churn (“hidden details” / “concealed” / “invisible”) deduct −0.4. Closure line itself is clean, keeping score above 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm accelerates during ladder climb, then breathes into longer cadence for the install moment. No loops; each sentence either advances mechanism or atmosphere. Metaphors are internally consistent—dust galaxies, spider-silk crack—never mixed. One near-scaffold: “amber hush” is saved by sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence performs at least two jobs (worldbuild + emotion, action + metaphor). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; figurative logic stays coherent (glass remembering sand extends the central conceit). Rhythm accelerates with the rupture, then exhales in the final line. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she watched as…”) does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety high, scaffolding minimal; most lines carry double duty (image + pressure). One paraphrase loop—“visible time” repeated three beats in succession—deducts lightly. Metaphors stay coherent (amber, gilt, velvet) and physically grounded. Read-aloud rhythm propels without drumbeat; strong verbs (“sang,” “shattered,” “burnished”) replace modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence carries image, sound, and motion without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: extended metaphors of sound-as-light and time-as-thread stay internally consistent. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. The final clause “time hung suspended between one heartbeat and the next” crystallizes rhythm without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with the cavern’s hush—long sentences pool, short punctures (“She sat”) halt momentum at exact emotional crests. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, justifying its saturation in the climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; only one paraphrase pair (“gravity seemed negotiable… boundary… dissolved”) that could compress. Line-level craft survives the read-aloud test with only hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: “knots…contained navigational mathematics” does triple duty. Occasional lyrical stack (“medieval bones vibrating with turbine-hum reverie”) risks purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or paraphrase; rhythm accelerates with storm, slows with joinery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “pooling in the pavilion’s doorways like mirrors of sky” advances thaw AND reflects interior clarity. No synonym loops; figurative language is sparse except in two intentional clusters that echo mural layering. Rhythm breathes—long painterly clauses contract to single-stroke fragments at climax. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; props (postcards, brushes, glass layers) remain tactile throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Figurative layering is dense but patterned—mirror/lagoon, cipher/debris, sediment/stone—each recurs with reweighted meaning, satisfying the “taught early” clause. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds (water cannot “reflect nothing” yet later “bubble upward,” but rule is retaught as supernatural bleed). One paraphrase loop (“arrange new debris…arranging beach debris”) knocks 0.2. Otherwise propulsion is high: noun-verb cores, minimal adjectives, sentences advance both image and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph cuts, high information density: each line advances image, world-rule, or interior calculation. Figurative language is selective and pattern-justified—no metaphor muddle at climax. One near-loop: “lanterns” thrice in five lines mid-reconstruction, but the beat’s pressure tolerates the echo. Otherwise zero scaffold, clean grammar, strong verbs; closing line delivers cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are dense but purposeful (“wax shaving… map drawn by accumulated human longing”) and repay at closure when the orchard literalizes the map. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles stay within sonic/cartographic domain. Sentence variety is high; no template cadence detected. Information density is excellent—one line often layers botanic, archival, and bodily data. One hairline slip: “velvet disquiet” repeated verbatim; otherwise zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    High figurative density but pattern-taught and payoff-clean; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with thaw cadence; final upward stream sentence is propulsive capstone.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and high information density; only minor loop (“after the glue dries” ×3) and one mixed metaphor (“cloud sea”) slightly dull the ear. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating meteor shower; paragraph lengths visually contract then expand like a lung. Figurative language is dense yet patterned—every metaphor is fire/light/seed related, avoiding mixed-vehicle chaos. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. The single near-scaffold “he understood now” is the only micro-drag, but it is immediately redeemed by the concrete act of placing the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric density serves accumulative design; metaphor chains (waxen cathedrals, sediment in chambers) stay coherent and terrain-bound. No mixed vehicles; rhythm breathes with scene cadence. Minor scaffold: “honey, bitter as smoke” and “heavy as honey, bitter as smoke” restate the same sensorial twist within two sentences—paraphrase loop −0.2. Otherwise high information density; closure line clean.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm modulates from languid clauses to staccato fragments without algorithmic drift. Figurative density is high but patterned, taught by first third, and charges closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances texture or knowledge. One mixed metaphor—“wound of twisted metal”—slips through but does not obscure the final dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences layer image without scaffold; occasional stacked modifiers (“quietly attended silences”) flirt with density but never dull the closure beat; zero loops, strong verbs, clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines multi-task: “copper served as universal translator” delivers world-logic, stakes, and sensory gleam in nine words. Varied sentence openings avoid template cadence; no filter-verb clusters. Metaphors are coherent—“calcified neural networks” extends stone imagery without mixed vehicles. A single scaffold phrase (“worked methodically through declining health”) could trim, but it does not mar the closure beat, keeping artifact penalty minor.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variation supports momentum: participial openings pace reflective beats; stark SVO pairs spike at microscope moment. Figurative language is selective—mixed metaphor vigilance finds none. Only minor scaffold: “dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path” restates prior image, but loop is isolated and does not touch closure. High information density; each paragraph advances premise or stakes. No artifacts in final third; 9+ path open.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose density is exceptional—sentences routinely triangulate reef memory, nutrient ratio, and linguistic cadence without paraphrase loops. Two adjacent “narrow vastness” repeats are deliberate echo, not scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to float free”) slips into the closure beat, dulling immediacy by a hair; otherwise momentum breathes with ritual slowness that suits the stake. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, propelling the final image without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with Ash’s trot–sniff–freeze pattern; no two sentences open alike. Figurative layering is dense but always canine-sensory: “rust and regret” is smell-tasted, not metaphoric ornament. No loops, no scaffold; every clause adds scent data or emotional torque. Only a single mixed register spike—“cartography of the heart”—slips toward human idiom, quickly reined in.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers physics, emotion, and metaphor without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned early (“seconds expanded…sugar in acid rain”) and paid off at exit, avoiding late clutter. A few adjective stacks (“pneumatic finality…temporal storm”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull closure. Clean grammar, no loops, strong read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: violet glaciers/copper air in same sentence world-builds, sets tone, anchors body. Varied sentence rhythm avoids drumbeat; paragraph lengths breathe with elevation pulses. Metaphors are purposeful (sky cracked like porcelain) and paid off by jasmine rain. No filter-verb clusters, loops, or mixed vehicles. Proof-level clean. Minor elision: “constellations shifted into impossible geometries” is tell, but immediate sensory follow-through earns it. Closure line retains clarity and lift.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence performs double duty—e.g., “applause, or perhaps warning” advances plot while re-tonalizing the stakes. Figurative language is sparse, surgical, and pattern-consistent: penumbra as predator, light that reveals by obscuring. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; even the repeated “benevolently ruthless” recurs only after it has been dramatized, so it functions as reprise, not filler. Rhythm accelerates into the sunlight burst, then snaps to the quiet final clause—precise line-level control under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; metaphor density serves the mythic cadence without clogging causality. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “hidden thunder trapped in a mason jar” is precise. The only minor artifact is occasional stacked prepositional phrases, but these never obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, accelerating during extraction beats, then breathing at mirror click. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances image, atmosphere, or knowledge. Figurative language is sparse, surgical: “woven hush” sustains without purple drift. Final rain line resolves cadence and motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm modulates from hushed sibilance to cascading polysyndeton as echoes multiply; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“seeds,” “shards,” “mist”—and pays off when the spire’s dispersal reveals “not one path forward, but many.” A few adjective stacks (“innocently mischievous child”) minorly clog, but closure image stays clear. Zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “brass pistons seizing” shows decay + stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided; acid, gold, marble stay coherent. One paraphrase loop spotted—“each crater she matched to a moment” echoes prior sentence—minor. No scaffold; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating danger.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; metaphors are coherent (“stalactites like frozen lightning,” “constellations of algae”). Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. A few adjectival pairings skirt purple but never stall propulsion. No loops or scaffold detected; closure beat is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: compound cadence for heat slog, staccato for cork insertion. No loops; each sentence adds new sensorial or causal layer. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent—thermal haze as fever dream, beam as lullaby through clenched teeth. Information density high: one sentence can depict heat, Voss’s delusion, and maritime death. Copy-clean except one possible typo (“master quarters” vs. “master’s”). Final line earns its lyric lift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from clausal cadences to hammered fragments (“Build the fulcrum.”), propelling the final ascent. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“starlit signal station,” “reverse migration”) so payoff feels earned, not overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure or sensory layer. Occasional elevated diction (“verdigris,” “meridian”) fits the navigator’s chart-maker lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“clung like a desperate prayer” justifies orchard stakes. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. High information density: one line can anchor body, tool, weather. Clean copy; pronouns track. Minor: “fractured grace” used twice, but second instance reprises with earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with tide—long clauses swell, then fragment under memory assault. Information density high: “silver petals preserved in salt and sorrow” fuses object, preservation method, and emotional valence in five words. Zero loops; each metaphor extends maritime physics (mist holds memory like water holds heat). Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line returns to “witnessed isolation,” now reweighted, satisfying echo test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “petals of glowing fungus balanced on their mandibles” does triple sensory work. No mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates across final paragraph without drumbeat monotony. Scaffolding almost zero—only “the creek roared behind him” repeats prior flood info. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences perform multiple tasks—"she pulled herself onto the shelf where the cobalt grotto waited, its mouth breathing warmth" moves body, reveals setting, carries metaphor. A few near-miss mixed metaphors ("sky that wept liquid light onto empty crowns") and minor echo ("bleeding" used thrice in 100 words) keep it from immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: caesuras in “ember nexus pulsed with directed spontaneity” give way to clipped prepositional phrases at seal-point. Figurative layering is high but patterned—each metaphor (shell as question-mark, palette as crushed decisions) is revisited and reweighted at closure. No paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, causality).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with altitude—long ascending clauses in flight, staccato landings on porch. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative density is high but patterned (jealousy → heat → balloon → wings) so it teaches its own physics. One mixed metaphor risk—“rotated prematurely” beside “amber” preservation—only hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is textured yet propulsive; figurative language clusters only in reflective beats where pattern is taught. No synonym loops or template cadence. Line like “silver comma suspended in amniotic fluid” is exact, not purple. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “saturated hush,” “bruised purple light,” each image doing double duty for mood and physics. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay coherent (storm/breath/crystal all phase-changes). A single mixed micro-image—“electric scent”—is borderline, but ozone does carry metallic taste, so physics holds. Final line lands with leaf-rustle auditory snap.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences do double duty: “dust motes swam like silver fish through shafts of dying sunlight” grounds both atmosphere and POV eye. No paraphrase loops; each new image advances pressure or object state. Mixed-metaphor watch: “chains of light” and “organs of lightning” stay within the musical/electrical frame, so permitted. One scaffold trace—“the imperfect miracle began to unfold” is tell-y—could prune, but it occurs pre-peak and doesn’t dull the final shatter. Rhythm breathes with the circuit surge, then cuts cold on bottle burst.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but figurative stacking in consecutive sentences (“luminous dust,” “resounding hush,” “cosmic illusions”) creates purple-tinged density without pattern-teaching payoff. Occasional template cadence (“she walked… she reached… she wrote”) mildly flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphors absent; spatial choreography clean. No artifacts touch closure line, so 9+ not disallowed, yet overwritten peaks keep score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, accelerating under countdown pressure, then braking at “zero.” Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “razor edges,” “frozen second,” each reappears to charge closure. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor risk—“time pooled like meltwater”—but saved by immediate physical grounding in granite cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “red dot trembles against the glass, a heartbeat made visible and dangerous” performs three jobs—image, emotion, foreshadow. One paraphrase loop (“how to touch without holding, how to sustain without claiming”) is purposeful incantation, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors; bioluminescence and cardiac imagery stay coherent. Rhythm modulates from humid long sentences to the staccato of dawn arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences do more than one job—"the booth stood beneath the third rail’s corpse" marries setting, danger, and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional loft—“cultivated estrangement,” “architecture of hello”—verges on aphorism but stays patterned enough to feel voice-driven rather than overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: each sentence layers sensory or cognitive detail without surplus modifiers. Occasional surplus nominalizations (“the archiving began”) could be trimmed, yet rhythm breathes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent (“paper lanterns,” “wet sugar”). Final paragraph achieves quiet crescendo without artifact, sustaining momentum into the closing Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid ivy curling to brisk catalogue of arrivals; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“ivy…like green fingers grasping yesterday’s departures”) and never clogs the climax. High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, character voice, and thematic seed. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor filter verb cluster in “he realized…” could be cleaner, but beat is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths swell and contract with frequency intensity. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends the sonic conceit, avoiding mixed-vehicle chaos. One minor scaffold: “languages of bark and stone that told stories of endurance and transformation” restates prior absorption. No loops or filter-verb clusters in peak silence beat. Opening and closing lines are sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but metaphor density approaches ceiling in two consecutive sentences (“pretzel logic,” “crooked configuration”). No loops or scaffold; information density high. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” conceptually fits but is academic diction; however, it is the narrator’s term, not Elara’s, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from lyrical long arcs to fragment punches; no template cadence. Metaphors are precise—“liquid silver,” “tapestry of negative space”—and never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Zero loops or scaffold; the final line “But the silence will” lands clean, resonant, unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “charcoal from the library embers” embeds setting, material, and backstory in five words. Figurative layer is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated register (“conflagration erasing centuries of curated lies”) risks purple but is earned by overall density. Zero loops, clean grammar, strong paragraph cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is thickly figurative but pattern-taught early: drumming = navigation, so extended auroral metaphors read as POV synesthesia rather than overwrite. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances sound, light, or body state. One mixed risk—“golden water lifted into the form of a woman”—hovers on cliché edge yet saved by subsequent “eyes made of starlight and sorrow” that recharges stakes. Minor alliteration drift in spots, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “listening to the telltale rhythm… signature in wet cement” does three jobs—characterize Voss, show Kael’s ear, seed theme. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language appears sparingly and purposefully. Paragraph cuts are clean; each advances knowledge or tension. A single adjective stack (“purple and green, auroras dancing”) is earned by storm spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exemplary: no synonym loops, no paraphrase drift; figurative strata serve pattern, not ornament. Sentence rhythm modulates pressure—“Night approached with spiralingly calm insistence” elongates, then staccato “The dock creaked softly” re-anchors breath. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line releases cadence into hush. Only micro-risk: occasional Latinate elevation (“obsidian surface,” “mechanical ingenuity”) but diction remains proportionate to mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but breathable; metaphors (ocean-captive stone, magnetic hush) remain coherent and scene-integrated. No synonym loops or template cadence. One paraphrase loop in closing paragraph noted above costs −0.2; otherwise information multi-tasks. Strong verbs predominate; punctuation clean. Read-aloud rhythm rises to breathless hush inside grotto, then exhales—effective sonic mimicry.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths mimic tide draw. High info density—each line layers sensory, emotional, world rule. Two adjacent “grace” phrases create minor paraphrase loop, −0.2. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays marine-coherent. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; strong verbs propel motion. Figurative language is dense but patterned—turbine shadows as clock hands, wood as secret-keeper—coherent under Elias’s rococo lens. No mixed metaphors or loops. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she watched him shave”) do not stall momentum. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is wide; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent—cloud-shadow, pollen-on-wind—without mixed-vehicle crashes. Density high: “cobalt tint of the atrium’s namesake” does triple duty (color, space, metaphor). Minor scaffold: “aesthetically driven” appears twice in close proximity; does not obscure closure. Read-aloud ear test passes; momentum breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating toward the furnace beat, then exhaling after the note. Figurative language is selective: “perfume only possible after the phoenix rises” anchors tone without clutter. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors; “concertina reed tongue” repeats only when necessary for causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings; information often double-loaded (“amber light floods… casting golden shadows”). No loops or mixed metaphors, though two adjacent “golden shadows” repeats could be trimmed. Figurative language clusters only in safe reflective beats, never during the decisive strike. Clean grammar, precise tense.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description braided with abstraction—yet remain clear. One metaphor chain (“liquid mercury tracing unpredictable algorithms”) risks density but is pattern-taught early and paid off, so artifact penalty is waived; no loops or register drift touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length and opening; one minor template run (“She… She… She…”) three-beat cadence is intentional ritual signal, paid off.  Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor (particles as suns, smiles that cracked faces) is internally coherent and advances knowledge or stakes.  Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffolding.  Final clause knife/dawn/scribble lands clean, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either footage logic or emotional charge. Metaphors are coherent: shadow elongating into wings respects dream-physics; no mixed vehicles. High density: one sentence often pairs physical action with conceptual pivot (“The shadow unbound finally bound itself…”). Final line echo of “softly deliberately” is earned callback, not template churn. Proofing clean: no typos, pronouns unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density—each sentence advances image or decision; zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“shedding felt like stripping off her own skin”) are sparse, purposeful, and paid off. One mixed humid/stars overlap in final paragraph barely grazes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence layers image and stakes without scaffold. Figurative language is controlled; mixed metaphors are avoided. A few near-repetitions (“frost,” “scar,” “miracle”) serve accumulative pattern rather than loops. Rhythm modulates from narcotic languor to crystalline final line, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (information + image). Two near-adjacent “stardust” mentions create minor echo but do not stall closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beat. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; clauses layer like strata to build texture rather than stall. A few adjacent metaphors compete (“white hardness of duty,” “stopped heart”) risking momentary blur, not severing causality. No loops or scaffold; syntax variety supports the incantatory intent. Clean mechanics, strong opening/final line match.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Quantum seed-catalogue and bioluminescent desert synthesize into a fresh eco-mythic image; the chess-clock-as-key feels both archetypal and newly coded for divergent futures. Concept commits fully—no late retreat to safe realism—achieving boldness without sacrificing clarity. Could edge higher with a sharper internal contradiction or societal implication, but stands memorably within speculative short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphor chains (copper leaves, gearbox vines) accumulate rather than stall. One paraphrase loop—“hum of insight vibrated wrong… ache behind the eyes” followed by “discordant frequency that made his expanded perception ache”—repeats without new pressure, −0.2. No mixed metaphors; clockwork/botanical vehicles stay coherent. Closing sentence breathes, resolving cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density—lines perform double duty (action + atmospherics) with minimal scaffold. Figurative layering is purposeful until “seraphically mundane” appears twice, a minor loop. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay cold/metal/frost family. Clause rhythm modulates to avoid drumbeat; paragraph cuts tight. Two proof nits: “nerve regeneration after his latest fall” could anchor time cue sooner; “bolt rolling between healing palms” repeats prior tactile image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Syntax flexes from orotund openings to clipped finality; no synonym loops or scaffold. Figurative density peaks at the collapse yet remains coherent—“dust fine as pollen” propels the ending image without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the temple’s sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “station creaked around her, anchored…drifting” fuses physical anchor and temporal metaphor. One paraphrase loop: “periodically eternal motion” echoes twice within four lines—minor, outside closure. Otherwise zero scaffold; figurative vehicles stay coherent. Strong information density propels without purple strain.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data. Figurative language is disciplined: "cathedral of scaffolds" establishes scale then recedes. One paraphrase loop—"the hum intensified, becoming a thunderous serenity"—is forgivable at climax. No scaffold, no synonym churn; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density: “minerals crystallizing into alien gardens” does world-building, stakes, and beauty in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent under volcanic logic—steam, resin, embryo, kite all share materiality. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in editor-voice, not Mira’s perception, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances soil check, memory flare, or thematic accretion. Metaphors (needles as constellations, armor as ice) stay consistent within arboreal physics. Filter verbs avoided; verbs like “clutching,” “layer,” “crumple” enact motion. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato freeze to final open vowel in “human hand still kept watch.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templates. Information density high—one sentence often paints, embodies, and foreshadows (“She used the broken tarot card box to gather the sorted threads, redesigning their pattern into something new”). Metaphors stay coherent (lighthouse as fist, threads as veins). Minor loop: “questions rhetorical questions” is a churn fragment; it nicks the peak beat but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm ripples without algorithm; sentence openings vary.  High density—each clause adds sensory or causal layer.  No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; “tearing silk” and “warm taffy” coexist in separate beats.  Minor paraphrase loop “after the eclipse ends” used as deliberate anaphora framing dissolve—acceptable pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: “crystalline suspension,” “dormant networks coughed to life” compress concept and image. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Variation in sentence length propels the upload beat. One mixed vehicle—“blood like distant applause”—but it clarifies disorientation and does not clutter closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density throughout: single sentences fuse sensory, historical, and ethical layers (“shed skin,” “calculus of blood-price”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“tranquil blaze”—is pattern-taught early and earns its place; no loops, no filter-verb stacks, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long inhalation sentences to staccato clauses under peak pressure (“The garden screamed, then hushed”). Figurative density is high but purposeful, each vehicle extending the acoustic metaphysics (soundscape, fossilized vowels). No synonym loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Minor strain in “transliterate” repetition (−0.2) but does not dull closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathe-able: “She dipped the rosewood nib into ink harvested from squid that lived only in the depths below the cloud layer” does world, character, and sensory work in one breath. Metaphors are coherent—sound as accusation, glass as lantern—and never mixed. Zero loops, no scaffold, no thesaurus-itis. The final sentence’s “uncharted before her” is a cliché minimalism that nicks perfection, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty (density + atmosphere), rhythm breathes with beats, and no paraphrase loops or scaffolding intrude. Occasional metaphor stacking (“terrible meteor hush… heavy origami”) flirts with overwriting but stays patterned and paid off; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances image or intensifies texture. Figurative language is patterned early (“mist coiled like questions”) and paid off at closure. No register drift; diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon of shapes and sound. High information density—one sentence often carries color, tactile data, and metaphor without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with shifting parts of speech. A single paraphrase loop ("mercy of bearing witness without flinching… holding pain so it does not metastasize") costs −0.2. Otherwise high density—each sentence advances image or moral stakes—and zero mixed metaphors in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Almost every sentence layers image + motion + sound; no paraphrase loops.  Occasional modifier stacks (“gold leaf and blood-red oil”) verge on purple but stay purposeful to synesthetic excess.  No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks.  Final third is artifact-free, preserving 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety supports momentum: long painterly cadences for spirals, staccato for discovery beats. Metaphors ("willowglass hope") recur with reweighted meaning, never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language pauses during the peak extraction beat, keeping propulsion clear. Minor scaffold: "fractally precise" appears three times—acceptable because pattern is taught early and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; most sentences dual-task (sense + metaphor + forward motion). Two adjacent near-repeats (“mapping sensory data…sensory map maker”) create minor loop; one mixed vehicle (“cave walls bloomed with colors invisible”) is permissible lyricism. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph maintains rhythmic lift without monotony; climactic golden flare is cleanly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm modulates from measured opening to compressed final cascade; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). One mixed metaphor—“fossilized time pooled”—but clarity remains intact; no loops or scaffold in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“clung,” “tilt,” “carving”) keep momentum. No paraphrase loops; one mixed metaphor—“water was cold, but it was moving”—skates by as conceptual, not sensory, so forgiven. Information density high: pillbox as both heirloom and payload revealed in same breath. Artifacts do not touch closure; stays above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (“shoulders gathered like storm clouds”) are few, deliberate, and paid off in closure. Information density high: one stitch equals meditation, rain-drop equals word. Minor elevation in diction (“palimpsest,” “vellum”) stays within a reflective lifeworld; no purple overload. Zero artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but patterned; metaphor clusters (“sun patterns that shifted like fault lines”) are taught early and paid off. One paraphrase loop—“sharp gentleness” repeated in closing paragraph—dulls the cadence slightly, yet the final line re-establishes propulsion. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence music varies naturally; the oar-cadence anaphora is purposeful and paid off. Information density is high—each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. No mixed metaphors; “quivering hush” is taught early and sustained. One scaffold phrase: “the rhythm of oars in water” is repeated verbatim; trimming the second instance would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but not purple; figurative language is patterned (cloud-ocean, frozen lightning) and pays off in the final sky-reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Strong verbs (“surge,” “snap,” “crystallize”) carry motion without modifier clutter. One mixed-metaphor risk—“brittle awakening crystallize within her”—is forgiven because the narrative immediately grounds it in frost-on-window image. Closure beat is free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from languid pond description to staccato nest-building; sentences open with changing parts of speech, avoiding template cadence.
    Figurative density is high but purposeful—each image (prismatic quiet, silver froth, speaking colors) recycles into the installation’s payoff.
    One mixed-metaphor watchspot: “architecture she used when building sentences” momentarily conflates syntax and carpentry, but context rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective: “galaxies in the stale air” opens, then yields to tactile verbs—“patched,” “rattling,” “slumped.” One mixed metaphor risk—“power plays of ancient cosmic entities” beside “gambling with civilizations”—but coherence recovers. Information density high; paragraphs advance physics, emotion, and stakes simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “cautiously hopeful” repeated four times; trimming two would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sound like dying breath”). High information density—each sentence advances stone, body, or clock. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the only elevated phrase, “tyranny of forgotten machines,” is earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—one simile per beat, each serving atmosphere or character lens. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. High information density: “ribbon’s microscopic weave matched not the heiress’s documented gown, but the custom lining of a rival’s jacket” does forensic + emotional work in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences pull double duty—description advances stakes: “mold colonized… in velvet blooms” foreshadows archival decay. Mixed metaphors (“breathed with spongey dread”) flirt with excess yet stay thematically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. One buried lead—jet-stream causality could open the story—but clarity recovers by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with altitude—short clauses thin as air, then lengthen into bow-stroke sentences. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: “metallic exoskeleton” matches scaffold, not mixed. Information density high—one line can emplace setting, reveal emotion, foreshadow dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “bills—yen, pesos, deutsche marks—represented every traveler his father had stopped” unpacks history while keeping present action alive. Metaphors are controlled (“metal lung breathing history”) and do not cascade into purple. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the dusk-to-dawn arc.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; metaphors (star pulses as syllables) cohere without stack-up. One scaffold loop: “she wrote of…” trio is purposeful litany, not artifact. Information density high; no mixed vehicles. Final third clean, permitting 9-band elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet lucid: each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (“green tornado of roots and rot”) are vivid but never stacked; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“expanding circles” repeated across two adjacent clauses—drops it 0.1. Otherwise rhythm breathes with escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: paragraphs swell then contract as glade rotates. Figurative language is selective—no metaphor storms. One mixed vehicle: “shadows pooled like ink between trees that hummed” fuses liquid & sound, but the synesthesia feels purposeful to warped time. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, high information density; sentences multitask.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion: almost every sentence couples observation to consequence—“traced roots…promise kept too long.” Metaphors stay vegetal, coherent; occasional minor overlap (“promise kept too long” / “torn fabric of fate”) but never in closure zone. Opening and final lines bookend with root/card symmetry, no scaffolding. One paraphrase loop mid-story—“destiny…barter…trammel” restated—drops the decimal.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm mirrors subject: long reflective sentences swell like feedback, then cut to clipped appraisal specs. Figurative language sparse, purposeful—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise zero scaffold. High information density: “OEM Fender-style wheat weave” does character, world, and plot work in five words.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative layering is patterned and purposeful—magnetic arbor, imprisoned lightning, cuneiform spores—each image returns in the dissolution beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final three sentences, mirroring dispersal. One microscopic slip: “obsidian surface etched with microscopic cuneiform patterns” could lose “patterns,” but the redundancy is forgivable amid high-density information.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “water lapping at its iron feet” lands beat, atmosphere, and cycle closure. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—tide/moon/creel weave returns—avoiding purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor (“luminescent fog that smelled of cedar”) is minor. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with tidal cadence; no drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density is justified by the textural premise; only one mixed metaphor cluster (“latent radiance…crystalline prison…spectral harmony”) risks overwriting, but it occurs pre-climax and does not obscure causality; sentence variety and propulsion remain strong to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: “the iron gates yielding to her crowbar with a shriek that scattered sparrows” moves action, sets sound, and foreshadows her own unsilencing. No paraphrase loops; each graffiti line adds new tactical or moral information. Metaphors stay coherent—ivy as fingers, bellows as lungs—without mixed vehicles. A single filter-verb cluster (“she had not returned…”) is strategically placed to compress backstory and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense lines: “water carrying dissolved crystals into the soil… archiving the dissent in woody tissue” does three jobs—image, stakes, closure setup. One mixed metaphor (“dark continents bleeding”) is minor and doesn’t touch closure. Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary opening and length. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final note, then falls into the hush of “bittersweet and alive.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anaphoric sentences mirror aurora curtains, then tighten to fragmentary clauses as the chip drinks the storm. Information density high—each sentence layers tactile, visual, and metaphysical data without scaffold. Only micro-loop: “lucidly watchful” appears twice in close proximity; the second could compress to “lucid” for freshness. No mixed metaphors; mineral heart, green net, dewdrops of consciousness all cohere inside the same physics.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet information-dense; each sentence layers metaphor onto physical motion. Figurative chains risk purple overload (“vineyard hush… wine pressing against cork”) but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; only minor register drift. Closure image remains clear despite lyrical heightening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences multi-task: “fabricated absolutions with such heartfelt conviction that the lies transmuted into temporary truths” advances character, theme, stakes. No synonym loops; each metaphor tied to maritime lens (truce-flag coat, granite certainty). Minor register elevation acceptable for philosophical fraud. Paragraph cuts tight—removing any breaks clarity or charge. Read-aloud ear varies cadence; no template cadence detected in peak unhook beat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with trance: long hypnotic coils tighten into staccato perceptual shards. Zero paraphrase loops; each image adds new pressure. One mixed metaphor—“perfect violence” of a pond ripple—is instantly redeemed by physical logic of expanding rings. No artifacts in final third; closure image stays crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Beautiful but overwritten: metaphor density approaches every sentence (“robes… geological formation”; “air itself became a solid record”). Some vehicles clash—how does sound “layer upon itself until… solid”? Paraphrase loops (“dust of centuries settled into… dust of centuries”) and template cadence (“he had… he had…”) slow propulsion. High-pressure beats are poetic, not propulsive; information density is aesthetic rather than causal. Closure image survives the purple haze but artifacts touch final third.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “frost-rimed calibration dials” does world, body, and theme in four words. Metaphors are coherent—machinery as frozen accusation, keystone breathing—without purple overload. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: “lingering luminance” is repeated three times; because it is the core motif the echo is purposeful, but still softens propulsion a notch. Clarity at closure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is wide; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“meteor hush”) and paid off in lantern ascent; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive and image-based. One minor scaffold: “luminous vows written in the margins” is abstract until later grounded; does not touch closure. Information density high—each sentence performs at least two jobs (atmosphere + motive, or setting + backstory).

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythmic variety carries the lyric overload; only minor scaffold ("the method was clear now" repeats concept) and one mixed metaphor ("message in a shrinking ocean" beside amber resin) slightly dull the peak. Otherwise信息-dense without paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—light as blood, monsters as grief—paid off in crystallization. One mixed metaphor “distant intimacy of touching something… untouchable” is earned by emotional paradox. Zero loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with dusk→night arc.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: seven-second anaphora, precise numerals, then release into imagistic final paragraph. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—“she understood that rebuilding required precision”—could be cut without loss; keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mirror hush, bruised sky, sediment settling. Occasional elevated latinate clauses (“archaeological patience,” “conceptual repricing”) nudge slightly above dam-warden vernacular, but the pattern is taught early and consistent, so forgiven at 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—starlings as ink, crystal as lens—and never mixed. Information density high: “frozen dew crystal” packs phase-change paradox in three words. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally, paragraph breaks timed to emotional crests. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Information-dense without clog: each sentence advances calibration, sensory data, or emotional stake. Metaphors are spare and accurate—"void where the descent would happen," "canopy bloom." No loops, no filter-verb stacks. A single participle opener slips into simultaneity ("positioning herself...") yet the action order remains clear and the closure line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes (“Below her, the world fractured and reformed…”). Metaphors are coherent—bell, blade, reed—without purple drift. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences beginning “Maya understood…” could compress, but the loop does not touch the climax. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of revisionist history.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, high information density; many sentences dual-purpose. Metaphors stay coherent (“roots seek water through stone”). Minor scaffold: “storm-born silence” thrice, “orthogonal approaches” twice—patterned but not loop-paraphrased. One mixed moment: “ozone sang in the air” edges toward purple yet fits POV.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative language is dense but patterned: the mixed metaphor of “weeps condensation” and “ribbed throat” is taught early and justified by the tunnel’s bodily architecture. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds either viscosity to the atmosphere or torque to the cord. The phrase “macerate the silence” risks overuse but earns its repetitions because each instance grinds the texture finer, mirroring the action described. Closure sentence avoids purple drift by ending on the single noun “air,” letting the silver dust dissipate into white space.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—image, metaphor, interior move. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to staccato “She waited. But the waiting was active.” Figurative layering is patterned, not cluttered; vehicles stay consistent (mist, frost, light). Minor scaffold: “she had been waiting…she had fled…she remembered” cluster could trim, yet artifacts never touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (“frozen bloom,” “carbon glass”) and pays off in the final image; no mixed metaphors. Loops are absent; sentences vary in length and launch angle. One paraphrase hiccup—“wood surrendered its lignin to glass” followed immediately by “wood surrendered its structure”—dulls a beat, but it does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong verbs and precise nouns propel momentum; sentences carry dual duty of world-building and stakes. Minor cadence loops (“the towers… the fragment… the shard…”) in paragraph 4 dull without obscuring causality. Mixed metaphor “serenely electric night air crystallized” survives because crystallization of silence literalizes the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry dual duty: “starlight knitting into bridges” advances both image and causality. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the maritime lexicon—tidal gasp, spectral grotto, sideways clocks—without contradiction. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with resonant cadence. One mixed metaphor—“clocks run sideways” beside “loose rope”—is forgiven under accumulative lens where pattern trumps physics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and texture; most lines do double duty (image + motion). Occasional stacked metaphors (“calcified into something harder than bone”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop late keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry dual freight: “anchor chain link warming in her weathered palm” fuses tactile heat with lived history. Rhythm alternates between cadenced reflection and clipped imperative, supporting the lesson-to-launch arc. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay consistent to metal, water, light. One paraphrase loop—“the peculiar mixture of grief and cosmic wonder” echoed as “somber marvel”—dulls edge without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: sibilants in “twilight bled into the mist-clad atrium,” then clipped beats for basement shock. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“breath disappeared into gray” stays within physical logic). One scaffold phrase—“she hadn’t come here to be a hero”—could be trimmed without loss, a minor loop. Otherwise high density: each sentence moves camera, body, or stakes; no filter-verb clusters; closure line is uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “facility existed in quantum flux, neither fully submerged nor dry” advances world-rule and stakes simultaneously. Figurative layers are disciplined: barnacle, lighthouse, highway metaphors orbit submersion/ signal axis without mixed collisions. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. One tiny filter-stack (“she watched”) in closing line, but it serves cadence, not clutter—does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform multiple jobs: “silver-blue illumination onto snowdrifts that buried the lower windows, creating a womb of ice” fuses light, tactility, and metaphor in one sweep. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse outside the ink lattice where it belongs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Closure beat—“snow that fell outside like forgiveness”—avoids purple by anchoring in prior color palette.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; no template runs. Figurative language is selective—“trapped lightning,” “throat-like passage”—and never clogs the high-pressure fracture beat. Information density high: one clause often fuses sensory, emotional, and world data. Zero paraphrase loops or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm modulates with beats. One paraphrase loop (“bitterness… cosmic joke” echoed twice) costs a hair. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final line lands clean with crystallized image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and stress pattern, propelling the musical ascent. No loops or synonym churn; each image does dual work (bridge sways / heart sways). One mixed metaphor edge—“gears of the statues’ minds” is abstract metal, but forgiven under lyric license. Closing line carries echo of opening bruised-silver sky, book-ending without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances map, body, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “absences like constellations” collapses geography and grief in four words. Information density is high—e.g., “slot eight holding only silence where a daughter’s handwriting once appeared” performs exposition, stakes, and time span in one clause. No artifact touches the closure beat; the final sentence’s cadence is allowed to stretch because it crystallizes the poise.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative language dense yet purposeful—pattern taught early (“misting hush”) and paid off. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor risk: “seed pod” adjacent to “compass” but context keeps logic intact. High information density; each sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—sensorial plus conceptual—avoiding scaffold; figurative language is sparse enough to keep the hyperbolic metaphors coherent. One micro-loop: “real touch, real weather, real time” triplet, but it serves as mantra anchored in scarf, not drift. Read-aloud rhythm flexes with ascent and fold, climaxing in the single-breath reawakening line.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are varied, propulsive, and information-dense: “She dipped her brush into pools of yesterday’s shadows…” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chains stay internally consistent (“pages turning underwater” sustains library-island fusion). One near-mixed metaphor: “time stretching like taffy” beside “tuning fork struck against bone” is acceptable under lyric license. Final line lands clean, recharging “luminous absence.”

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence texture varies from long breathy coils to fragment sparks (“The ribbon snapped free”). Figurative language is selective, never more than one image per beat, keeping causality clear. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Two near-mixed metaphors—“pinprick in velvet” beside “singularity of dread”—pass because they occupy different perceptual layers. Propulsion stays high; no line could be cut without dilating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense but breathable; sentences layer job and mood (“iron ribs corroded red against the green-black water”). One paraphrase loop—“memories flooded back…visible as silver mist rising”—slips in the closure beat, trimming top band. Otherwise no template cadence or mixed metaphor. Opening line anchors stakes; final line recharges compass/constellation motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is rationed—dust “like a bruise,” velvet-wrapped blade—each image earns its place and recurs with added charge. Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high (one sentence often does description + interior shift + foreshadow). Minor filter verbs appear only when POV demands perceptual distance, never in climax beats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Metaphors occasionally stack (“liquid crystal,” “golden smoke,” “oil-slick rainbows”) in successive sentences, but density thins before the closure beat. Strong verbs dominate; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed image—“gray lands reached … cold and seductive promise of rest”—slightly blurs agency: is the promise external or felt?

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is high-density figurative yet coherent; vehicles converge on light, silence, fracture, sediment. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence lengths vary to mimic the tug-and-release of knots. One mixed metaphor risk—“starlight splitting darkness into manageable colors”—but context keeps it legible. Final line lands clean, no scaffolding, absolute stillness earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from lyrical suspension to tight clauses, mirroring cautious descent. Figurative language is selective (“root systems that had grown complacent”) and never stacks into purple. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “had” pluperfects in the fourth paragraph slow propulsion slightly. Closure image is clean, unburdened by verbal clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform double duty—“light refracted through salt-preserved portholes to illuminate floating spines”—propelling both image and goal. One minor scaffold loop (“the way...the way...”) appears mid-piece but does not touch the closure beat; figurative vehicles cohere around pressure/resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “fossilized gardens…into luminous dust” compresses eons into one image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either mist physics or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent (wind-chime clockworks) and physically grounded. Minor overwrite: “mechanical sorrow” edges personification convenience, but occurs early and becomes motif. Closure sentence is clean, single-image, ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence lengths create lift-car cadence; figurative language sparse enough to avoid purple drift. No loops, no scaffold, high information density. Occasional stacked adjectives (“impossible dream, merciless clarity”) ride the lyrical edge but never obscure causality. Clean mechanics, proofread copy, strong paragraph cut efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm mostly varied; one run of three “she… then she…” constructions near the middle creates template cadence (-0.3). Metaphors are coherent; only one blend (“nerve endings seeking connection” atop frayed twine) slightly jostles physical logic. Density strong; few filter verbs. No artifacts in closure beat. Would tighten with one fewer adjectival cloud descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sensuous clauses for pigment work, staccato “engines roared to life” for demolition. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances texture or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—wood as ribosome, cloud as gradient—no mixed vehicles. Only hairline slip: “texture that would shimmer like actual atmosphere” leans toward tell, but immediately redeemed by tactile proof of dawn light.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, imagery dense yet purposeful; only minor scaffold (“she began to note… she worked through…”) drags momentum. No mixed metaphors, no loops in peak beats. Register elevated but consistent with antiquarian airship tone. One paraphrase loop (−0.2) keeps it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between frost-bitten fragments and clock-work clauses, propelling without scaffold. Figurative density peaks only at the uncap beat, where mixed metaphors (“liquid silk,” “invisible currents”) are justified by the supernatural release. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances temperature, gear-state, or reflection. Opening and closing lines mirror each other in cadence, creating a satisfying audible click.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective (“shimmered like dying stars”) and purposeful. High information density: each line advances atmosphere or tactic. Only minor scaffold: “as it always was when the ghost appeared” restates desertion already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating caesuras; clauses accrete then shed like red-shifted light. Metaphors stay coherent within entropy physics; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and cosmological work. Minor scaffold: three successive “She…” openings mid-text create template cadence (−0.2). Otherwise zero loops, no filter-verb stacks, and the final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rolled the first nut across the limestone…offhandedly exact placement” does double duty—action + characterization. Metaphors are spare and physical—“brass wings catching dying light”—never clog causality. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks. Final line cadence mirrors exhausted inhale, landing emotional exhale without melodrama. One over-adjectived phrase (“luminescent shadows shifted”) is minor artifact, not closure-adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varied sentence rhythm mirrors braided currents; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor elevated register (“conceptual ghost”) is earned by POV. Clean mechanics, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; information density high—each line advances image or concept. Occasional stacked modifiers (“integrated fragmentation that composed her existence”) flirt with purple but serve voice. No loops, no scaffold; metaphor stays coherent. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with action; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“cathedral of coral and frost”, “glacier of guilt”) are few, patterned early, and pay off in closure. One mixed risk—“sandpaper rough memories” is tactile yet workshop-common—but fits her self-conception. Density stays high; every sentence advances image, motive, or external move, propelling to the final salt-stain note.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape; information density is high without purple overload. One scaffold loop—“grain elevators… grain elevators talks”—repeats near-identical phrasing within two lines, a minor artifact that prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    High figurative density risks purple fatigue, yet the pattern is taught early and held consistently; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop—“chaotically precise” appears four times with no new angle—dings momentum. Otherwise clean: strong verbs, no scaffold, pronouns anchored, final line crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but legible, with high information ratio; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“mist like breath from some sleeping beast”) are singular and tied to POV; no mixed vehicles obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances analysis or atmosphere. Metaphors are biologically precise—“grain like sheet music”—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can layer tool, history, and bodily risk. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line offers resonant image that recharges the uncurl motif. One tiny register drift: “symphonically minded” appears twice; the second use could compress, but it is earned by then.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with magnetic pulses—long sentences coil, then fracture in the moment the stone splits. Figurative language is selective: “iron filings stood like hair on a cat’s back” is brief, tactile, and never repeated. No synonym loops; each sensory return (dent, hum, violet) gains new informational load. Highest-pressure beat (“the silence broke—not with sound, but with recognition”) is spare, avoiding metaphor clutter that would dull the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density is high—one sentence often layers sensory data, scientific term, and emotional charge. Figurative language is selective: sustained acoustic metaphors avoid clutter. Minor template cadence in “He detected… he shifted… he adjusted” costs −0.2. Otherwise no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; the final line varies syntax and lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Paragraph rhythm breathes with elevation changes; openings vary. Density is high—one sentence often does two jobs. Minor loop: “wildflower hush” repeated front and back feels purposeful reprise, not churn. One scaffold: “cultivate serenity within motion” is stated twice with near-paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent (tide, heartbeat). No artifact touches closure. Filter verbs minimal and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: “water flowed upward around her rig” fuses direction, setting, and motion in six words. Figurative layer is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—avoiding purple clutter. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensorial or causal newness. A single mixed image (“frozen lightning suspended in impossible equilibriums”) is forgiven because it occurs in an expository slot, not the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “rust-red and slate-gray walls forming unnatural canyons” does double world/character work. One paraphrase loop—“wind spoke of pressure differentials and thermal layers” followed immediately by “how the gas had pooled and eddied”—costs a tenth. Otherwise every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Final line’s whisper is earned, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, clauses stacking like ice laminations, then shearing short on impact beats. Few filters; verbs are strong (“rang,” “blazed,” “dissolved”). One paraphrase loop: “frozen breath / frozen atmosphere” within five lines. No mixed metaphors; aurora as liquid radiance is sustained. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirrored cadence, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Metaphors stay physically coherent (stones into deep water, thread through linen). High information density: each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. No register drift; diction stays within her weathered, geological lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: “filtered the dying light above” does atmosphere + time in five words. Mixed metaphors are intentional (geometry vs. liquid) and coherent within the emotional alchemy premise. No loops, no filler; every sentence advances image or pressure. Final line achieves Charged Poise through terse inversion after lyrical surge.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong varied rhythm, high density—most sentences move stake or image. One scaffold loop: “shared tea, shared silence, shared the story” could compress. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with concrete noun or motion, avoiding template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“quartz-born humming”) so it pays off rather than clots. One clause—“the shifted hush moved from the forest into her chest”—skirts abstraction yet lands because prepped by prior quartz resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary from short gasps to winding threads; no template cadence. Figurative layering—“raveling silence,” “copper and gold cyclone”—is dense but patterned, taught early, and paid off in the hovering bead. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is textured yet economical; sentences carry dual duty (“wrapped the magician’s silk… movements that betrayed a quietly determined spirit”). Figurative layer is sparse, pattern-taught (forge/seed/arch) and paid off without clutter. Zero paraphrase loops, zero register drift. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match planetary inhale—an intentional cadence shift that sharpens resonance rather than dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density—each sentence layers sensory or emotional payload; occasional metaphor stacking (“distance between parallel universes”) is purposeful under the accumulative lens, no loops or scaffold dull the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from rolling cadences to single-clamp fragments; no template runs. Metaphors stay physical—“flat shale for sorrow”—and never stack into purple. Information dual-loads: “seventeen years of silence” marries cargo weight to emotional freight. Only minor loop: “absolute vigilance met absolute vulnerability” restates the same polarity twice; otherwise zero scaffold or filter-verb drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences swell and contract like weather; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Figurative density is high but warranted—each metaphor (liquid luminescence, tactile ghost) services the central print-vs-light conceit rather than ornamenting for flash. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“conceptual illumination,” “total internal reflection”) momentarily lifts the POV above storm-herald vernacular, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+. Otherwise clean grammar, exact punctuation, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with pavilion rotation; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. Tiny loop: “watching, always watching” echoes thrice but serves mantra-like fixation so forgivable. One passive (“was waking”) could trim, yet propulsion never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variation and information density remain high; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she understood,” “she realised”) slightly dull two beats. Figurative coherence holds—mixed moon/lightning refraction sustains physical logic without metaphor collision.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—light as textile—so it reads as taught compression, not purple overflow. One paraphrase loop (“binding and liberating simultaneously”) is allowed as thematic hinge. Information density strong: each clause adds sensory or causal layer. Closure line is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long, vaulting sentences to the clipped final triad—“The door creaked open. / The young woman stepped... / Tears gathered...”—echoing the heartbeat Elias overhears. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high information density; the prose is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphors (ivy swallowing iron, bread hard as ceramic) are spare and precise. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports the accretive cadence—critical for textural escalation. Every paragraph either advances growth, stakes, or communal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, and emotional temperature. Metaphors stay internally consistent (continent-mapping, dying stars). One scaffold pair: “preserved only by the thermal inversion that kept the spires entombed in ice” could trim to “preserved by thermal inversion entombing spires in ice.” Final third clean; no figurative clutter at closure. Occasional adjectival elegance (“gently meticulous precision”) tolerated because it is motif-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence moves position, sound, or stakes: “She retreats, begins again” is a complete tactical unit. Figurative control avoids clutter—only two metaphors per beat, each tied to pier decay (barnacles as coins, lanterns swaying like prayer). No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors; the single Template-cadence run (“false starts” x3) is motivated and pays off in closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—e.g., “root systems transmitting chemical ballots” fuses worldrule and stakes. OccasionalModifier stacks (“terrestrially cosmic in its ancient marriage…”) flirt with purple but pattern-taught and brief, not obscuring cause. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density—“prismatic crystals catching stray photons and scattering them across the walls in bands of auroral sorrow” does three jobs in one line. Metaphor vehicles congruent: lock sighs, cave breathes, metal becomes foundation. Rhythm accelerates during lock-pick without monotony. No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beat. Final line lands on concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with corridor steam; clauses accrete like condensation, then snap clean at the vault door. Metaphors stay vegetal and postal, avoiding mixed vehicles. One scaffold: “words sent but never received in the collapse” restates prior clause; minor, doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances mechanism, atmosphere, or stake. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“color that reminded humans they were small”—never cluttering the high-pressure release. Information density peaks as gears transfer momentum; clarity stays immaculate. Closure line is unburdened by ornament yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse botany, circuitry, and magnetics. Metaphors stay coherent—fire as translation, smoke as neural map. Tiny loop: “miniaturize the scope” appears thrice with slightly varied phrasing; does not obscure closure. Final third clean, no artifact; cadence slows to match cooling ash.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and musical; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“amber rays... sandstorm frozen in time” inside one sentence) flirt with overwriting, but no loops or scaffold stall the final beat; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dance beats; sentence length mirrors pirouette/pause structure. Metaphors are consistent—web, tide, cipher—no mixed vehicles. One loop: “patient as a spider spins its web” appears twice; minor scaffold but does not dull closure. High density; every sentence advances image or decryption step.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty: “she adjusted her gait to compensate for invisible tides beneath the stone” simultaneously reveals physics, body, and metaphor. Figurative language is selective, never denser than one image per high-pressure beat. Zero paraphrase loops; opening and closing lines echo “gleaming silence” with recharged meaning. One microscopic scaffold: “salt crystal growing chamber” is repeated noun-phrase, but it anchors orientation and reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Density is high yet purposeful; metaphorical layering supports Accumulative mode. Occasional adjacency loops (“between heartbeats… between water droplets”) repeat syntactic slot without new pressure, minor drag. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are taut.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The cornice brackets are questioning pronouns” advances both world rule and theme. Metaphors are architecturally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each descriptor adds new informational layer. Occasional elevated diction (“ontological,” “palimpsest”) fits POV’s scholarly desire without cluttering peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses with the singing, sentences waxing and waning without template drift. Figurative layering is high but patterned—every velvet or silver image returns charged, so density earns its keep. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“metastasize,” “topography”) nicks authenticity yet remains consistent with her archivist precision.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layering (“pearl twilight,” “mineral music”) is patterned early and pays off in closure without density overload. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One hairline slip—“the slow patience of stone” skirts personification cliché—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful—“arteries of stone,” “frozen river of light”—teaching the cosmic/corporeal braid that closure reprises. No mixed metaphors; sandstone, starlight, shell keep physical logic intact. One clause—“dust of centuries”—could feel stock, but it’s immediately grounded by bare-foot sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the concentrated essence of a father’s love that had protected her escape” packs event, metaphor, and emotional stake in one clause. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or pressure. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors in closing paragraph, each extending the glass/liquid/purity axis without muddle. Rhythm breathes: long sentence for shrine arrival, fragment for globe turn, crescendo for promise. Minor tick: “like tear tracks” is a near-cliché, but saved by specificity of salt crystal pattern. No filter-verb stacks; actions stay in vivid past. Opening and closing lines book-end with starlight, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances pattern, image, or breath. Figurative language is disciplined—“moon paths” stay consistent, never mixed. Information density high: one sentence can layer grid, light, and philosophy. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors firefly pulse acceleration without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “She held the reassembled letter in her trembling hands, understanding now why the trees bore fruit without seeds and why the storms circled like hungry wolves denied entry” advances knowledge, image, and stakes in one breath. No scaffold loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay physically coherent—storms as wolves, diamond crack as mouth—then reify into measurable frequency. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the final clause without tumbling into drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density—every sentence layers meteorology, electronics, theology. Metaphors are controlled (“origami swans made of smoke”) and internally consistent. Filter verbs minimal; strong tactile verbs charge motion. One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“lightning stitched… again and again”) is pattern-taught storm pulse, not artifact. Final cobalt rain image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long lyrical sentences for dawn stillness, staccato fragments for the jar release. Figurative density is high but patterned (sound as smoke, redemption as map) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Minor register lift—“phonetic map,” “genetic sorrow”—skirts academic, yet fits ex-professor POV and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, propulsive, no scaffold; figuratives are sparse and accurate (“azure coat flapping like a banner”). High information density—each sentence advances goal or atmosphere—without purple overload or mixed metaphors that could dull the harmonic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences perform double duty: “The lake had frozen over last month, sealing away the rush of autumn rain that had charged the mineral deposits beneath its surface” delivers backstory, physics, and foreshadowing in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors stay coherent—magnetic bridge as “promise kept and released”—and do not congest high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: mud-squelch, drip, pulse. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative control—lantern as “talisman against the darkness” is single, earned. Proofreading clean; only micro-repeat of “reverberating” twice in 700 words, not dense enough to penalize.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density—each sentence advances guilt or artifact. Occasional purple lifts (“violet desperation”) and a paraphrase loop on “apology into action” dull the peak. No artifacts touch the closure beat; rhythm breathes correctly at the oath.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loop or scaffold; sentences multi-task (“the acid sea…had been calcifying throughout the evolution of the continent”). Metaphors stay mechanical-coherent; no register drift. Information-dense yet breathe-worthy; final line is propulsive hinge. Only hairline slip: “vibrating just beyond the threshold of mechanical perception” skirts abstract, but is saved by immediate embodied transliteration.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and information density; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“tangible ghost haunting the machine”) and two near-simultaneous participle phrases dull clarity in the climax, keeping it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long anaphoric clauses build, then a four-word sentence ruptures. Metaphors are internally consistent—dying giants, paper boats, satisfied serpents—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “crystal ball fragment… caught the aurora light that pulsed in sickly greens” does three jobs (prop, sensory, stakes). One paraphrase loop—“weighted breath before reply” repeated—dings slightly; otherwise zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density, varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and patterned, never overtaking urgency; final line breathes cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional contour; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense (“skeletal gestures,” “religion she no longer practiced”) yet stays coherent within vineyard lexicon. One paraphrase loop—“their separation was not a failure… but its maturation” mirrors earlier “destined mismatches” claim, but occurs at thematic crest, not in propulsive beat, so deduction is minor. Zero scaffolding; high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. High density: “kinetic parapet beneath the dunes stirred with mechanical grace” fuses setting, object, motion. No loops or scaffold; figuratives stay coherent (“silver dust,” “key turning”). Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Zero artifacts in final third; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; no loops or mixed metaphors. Selective detail—“dove gray map case against her hip,” “spiral that drew the eye inward then outward”—carries double duty, advancing both image and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates; stacked metaphors are patterned early and earned by closure. No synonym loops or scaffold. Dew “percussion,” “mycelium cursive” are fresh yet precise. One mixed vehicle: “rainwater in a leaf’s cup” inside a crystal fracture momentarily blurs physics—minor, not at climax. Clean enough for 9-territory; micro metaphor slip keeps fractional guard.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but patterned: repeated spirals, falling, pooling light create accumulative music without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (leaf descent = temporal brake) and serve the textural lens. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong. One minor scaffold: “the mechanism had become changelessly constant in its hysteria” could trim to “hysterically constant,” yet rhythm is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density serves accumulative pattern; mixed metaphors avoided. One paraphrase loop—“pulsing stillness” repeated with variant phrasings—dulls final paragraph. Otherwise propulsion clean; no scaffold, no filter-verb clusters. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with morphine-metronome beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines are dense, rhythmic, largely propulsive; mixed metaphors are few (“shadows peeling like wet skin” is visceral, coherent). Two adjacent paraphrase loops—“she had to relearn...she had to relearn”—in the middle beat deduct 0.2. Filter-verb clusters absent; figurative language thins during the high-pressure loop-walk, giving clarity. No scaffolding obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—one job per sentence, no filler. Occasional lyrical stacking (“orbital, a place where lost things circled”) risks density yet serves the accumulative lens. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; closing image of thorns-turned-gold lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative layering is high but patterned; mixed metaphors (“cathedral of stone and vapor,” “serpent coiled”) stay within geologic/organic field and payoff at pearl formation. No loops or scaffold; sentence variation propels. One density bump: “weigh it against the memory of star-fire” repeats conceptual weighing twice in three sentences, a hairline drag.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is near flawless: every sentence does two jobs (image + pressure) and propels. Figurative language is patterned, not stacked—thaw, drip, pool, absorb becomes anaphoric engine. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The −0.2 keep-it-from-9.0 is a single mixed register moment: “conceptual repricing” feels academic against the fungal diction, but it occurs mid-story, not at closure, so artifact does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush yet mostly loop-free; only “moving against the current” repeats three times without intensifying meaning. Mixed metaphors (“architectures of possibility” beside “seeds in moisture”) coexist within lyric license and do not obscure causality. Density is high—each sentence doing image + emotion + world rule. One paraphrase loop inside “closing pages” refrain costs minor propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is high—each sentence advances image, process, or pressure. Figurative language is disciplined: mixed metaphors are avoided; “cold fire” is justified by flash-paper chemistry. Zero loops or synonym churn; no filler filters. The read-aloud rhythm breathes with the scene’s glacial tempo, accelerating only at the cold-fire ignition, then settling into the final quiet pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Density: "harvested temporal resonance in its mainspring" collapses physics into image without scaffold. Rhythmic variety—spondaic chips ("copper corpse") beside liquid participial chains—matches pulse of discovery. No loops, no synonym churn; final sentence braids core motifs elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences layer like the shingled hush—nested participial phrases that mirror recursive theme—yet remain precise; no mixed metaphors or filler loops. Clause variety breathes with loom strokes, propelling ritual momentum. Only minor scaffold: repeated “she” openers in paragraph 4, but pattern serves liturgical cadence, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Information density high—“The ash wood carving blank sat heavy in her palms, its grain running like the stripes she used to brush on her husband's lions” does triple duty: haptic, backstory, simile. Figurative logic stays coherent; rain as lens/time is maintained without mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops. Final paragraph lands on concrete nouns and strong verbs: “she set down her cup and picked up the chisel once more.”

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence lengths breathe with discovery then tighten into short declaratives at the trade. Density high—each line does setting + metaphor + interiority—yet clarity intact. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks; “let the years pour out” is show, not tell. One microscopic snag: “dandelion seeds” and “dormant seeds” create faint echo; not quite loop but keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence either maps a system or records a tactile micro-victory. Rhythm breathes—long accumulative clauses build to short, luminous payoff (“the terminal could breathe again”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor caution: two successive sentences open with “She…” in the reroute paragraph—template cadence almost emerges but is broken by next beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, glacial, yet propulsive; no template cadence or synonym churn. Information density high—one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and world data. Occasional lofted phrases (“spectral scales that danced”) skirt purple but serve the sunrise transmutation. Zero scaffolding; every paragraph survives the cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences build texture, then staccato gait (“She stepped… She had learned…”) mirrors walking. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“fractured,” “sank,” “pries”) replace modifiers. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“architecture of lies” built of floorboards). No loops or synonym churn. Final line lands with image cadence, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Almost every sentence does two jobs: “Its hollow interior glowing faintly with captured electricity” fuses image, backstory, and stakes. Minor scaffold: “infinitely patient” is repeated three times; the third feels liturgical rather than accidental, but still nicks. No mixed metaphors; fog, snow, and glass cohere physically. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“coax,” “flare,” “compress”) drive propulsion. Final line lands with image-led resonance, no explain-everything drag.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty (description + interior momentum); strong verbs (“spindled,” “cascaded”) replace modifiers. Only two adjacent paraphrases (“empty garden” / “vacant spaces”)—minor loop, not at closure. Mixed-metaphor risk (“geography…tapestry”) is anchored by consistent textile grammar. Final paragraph varies cadence, ending on monosyllabic pulse-word for resonance. Zero artifacts in last third; high-band gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings diversify. High info density: “coat torn from years of scrabbling” does world, backstory, texture in six words. No loops, no scaffold. Mixed metaphors absent; “thunder wrapped in silk” is precise. Only minor filter verbs, voice-motivated. Final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility. Proofing spotless.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence.  Dense figurative runs (“obsidian lagoon,” “silver silence”) risk purple tint, yet pattern is set early and never breaks closure clarity.  One paraphrase loop: “pressed the kelp graft harder… feeling the first prickling return of feeling” could compress, but momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences alternate between long accumulative clauses and sharp releases. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; “ice breaking on a river in spring” is single clean vehicle. Occasional elevated diction (“sidereal”) is POV-justified. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent participial phrases (“watching…counting…”) but they serve temporal stretch and do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either thickens texture or advances transit. Metaphors are mutually coherent—gear math, petal entropy, charcoal shame—culminating in the “soft constellation” that re-images infinity. Rhythm accelerates with longer anaphoric cadences then exhales into the final single-sentence paragraph, mirroring the shift from recursion to repose.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lyric cadence sustains momentum but recurrent “-ing” openings and stacked metaphors (“sun bled violet… thundering calm… trapped moonlight”) create minor purple density. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information is dual-purpose. Occasional simultaneity glitch: “He picked up his mallet and began to retrace…” implies two actions when one is continuous. Otherwise syntax varied; paragraph cuts crisp; final sentence lands with satisfying sonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, backstory—without scaffold: “He carried the broken rake handle in his coat pocket, its splintered wood pressing against his ribs like a penance he could not set down.” Metaphors stay coherent (tide as heartbeat, clock as judge) and never clutter the high-pressure beat. One paraphrase loop (“adjusted…adjustment”) is negligible. Ear-test rhythm modulates naturally; clause variety supports propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; sentence lengths contract under discovery tension. Few modifiers, strong verbs—“swallowed starlight,” “frayed selvage spoke.” One mixed metaphor cluster (“chess clock…game continued”) but cleared before closure. No scaffold loops; every paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor purple flicker (“velveteen gloom” twice) not reaching artifact threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers science (differential equations, quantum probabilities) with mythic image without clogging. One paraphrase loop detected (“frozen lake” mirrored three times in four sentences) but it serves as pattern-teaching for the final crack, so penalty minimal. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, with sentence length modulating like musical phrases; no scaffold or synonym loops. Occasional elevated diction (“archaeology of breath”) is earned by the orchestral milieu and never muddies causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (waves smoothing stone, dark snow, reverse-photograph) pays off in closure image. Information density high: single sentences fuse ash physics, memory erosion, and emotional cost. Micro-scaffold only in “the old rocking chair creaked its final rhythm / slows to a stop” restatement, not severe enough to obscure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies from briny terse to rolling cadence; high info density—each line performs two jobs (world + interior). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within maritime-mechanical field. Minor overwriting: three consecutive adjective stacks in “concrete leviathan” sentence, but beat is low-pressure, does not dull closure. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm breathes with lesson tempo; sentence variety supports the incense-like hang of resonance. No paraphrase loops, but “velvet” and “autumn” recurrence edges toward motif fatigue. Figurative language is selective—each metaphor serves the subtractive philosophy. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse/hang/denote”) slightly cushions immediacy yet stays within lyrical许可.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high but purposeful, pattern-taught and paid off; no mixed metaphors obstruct clarity. Information density excellent—single sentences layer rust, memory, and political erasure. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she tasted…”) appear but serve synaptic exposition without dulling immediacy. Final image line has clean propulsion and zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; few filters, no scaffold loops. Density is high—“liquid gold” metaphor stacked beside “burnt honey” in adjacent sentences—yet stays legible under lyric pressure. Mixed metaphor “honey too thick to swallow” for compulsion works because gustatory synesthesia is already licensed. Two near-paraphrases about “grinding regularity” and “mechanical efficiency” could compress, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure: long accumulative sentences build texture, then短, percussive articulations mark recognition. Figurative language is dense but patterned—“salt forming on glass,” “grammar of rearrangement”—so it teaches its own logic. One near-loop: “displaced objects” is repeated twice in close proximity without new inflection. Otherwise high density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose density is high—metaphor every second sentence—yet pattern-taught early (“bloomed like violet bruises”) so it reads as voice rather than overlay. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay aquatic, lithic, or pharmacological. One paraphrase loop detected (“mercy with edges” / “mercy and judgment”) but it serves thematic reprise and does not dull closure. Rhythm modulates from long hydrothermal breaths to staccato root-spiral sentences, propelling the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: pendulum, tooth, sepia, hum—each returns to charge the closure, avoiding decorative overload. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image extends the central conceit of mechanical perfection cracked by organic flaw. Sentence variety is purposeful—cumulative climbs, staccato proofs, final short stride through fissure. One near-scaffold: “furious mathematical proofs, theorems cascading like waterfalls of logic” could lose either “furious” or “like waterfalls,” but the moment passes quickly and does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; metaphor strings are dense but patterned early (“slow silver constellations,” “saffron quiet”) and payoff at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed-metaphor risk—“industrial haze that never cleared, not even in spring”—is minor. Information density is high: each sentence layers scent, light, and stakes without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; long sentence of “black rivers devouring woven rivers” crashes into staccato “She worked through the night.” Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and archival work. No loops or mixed metaphors; “rosewater dread” recurs with accruing meaning. Minor scaffold: “the Method of Memory persisted…” is abstract label, but it’s the only light instance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences are dense but propulsive; figurative layers serve concept (light that feeds). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler. Variation in cadence accelerates during unwinding sequence, slowing to awe-struck brevity at vanish-point.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines carry double duty—image + causality—without scaffold. Rhythm accelerates through fragment bursts at climax, then exhales into “morning light unburdened.” One metaphor-cluster beat in mirror-hall description grazes overwrite but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the ritual crescendo. Figurative language is dense but patterned—each metaphor extends acoustic physics (sound as visible geometry) rather than decorative trope. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines are ear-worm memorable. Minor elevated diction (“indigo into the starving sea”) reads intentional to hymn-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; sentences layer job and atmosphere without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“geometry made audible” extends the shell-pattern logic. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“transcended,” “conceptual repricing”) is the only micro-drift, but it aligns with the abstract revelation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with dive/ascend cycles; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—water, music, textile—so it accrues rather than clutters. Information dual-loads: “seaweed drapes the balcony where a soprano sang her final aria” fuses sensory, history, and loss. One paraphrase loop: “interlaced absence” is repeated twice without new inflection; minor −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene—long sentences for underwater hush, shorter clauses for the tilted-floor surprise. Figurative diction is selective rather than saturated; no mixed metaphors intrude. Occasional elevated phrasing (“reclaimed stillness settled into his chest like silt”) risks a faint poetic gloss, but it fits the reflective beat and does not clog clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every mineral metaphor returns transformed at closure, avoiding purple overload. Information density is high: each line advances folding, memory, or corporeal dissolution. Final paragraph contains zero scaffolding; the last clause “diving into the heart of light” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure; occasional modifier stacks (“intangibly tangible weight”) flirt with overwriting but stop short of muddle. No loops, clean propulsion; one missed comma splice in breakers sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm echoing the slow wheel of stars; no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors are avoided—"the universe’s white noise" stays consistent with radio imagery. High information density: single sentences fuse emotional, tactile, and conceptual work ("the missing pieces assembled themselves not in the machine, but in his chest"). Minor filter-verb cluster ("began following," "began to pulse") keeps this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; information density is high. Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual gravity,” “specific gravity of his crimes”—edges toward register drift but remains within Elias’s reflective lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “weight of unspoken words” echoed as “weight of what he had learned.” Closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lantern that swayed like a pendulum between apology and forgiveness” compresses political limbo into one image. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stance or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“tides of suspicion toward low ebb”—is minor against the overall precision. Final paragraph’s heartbeat count replaces cliché closure with somatic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid and propulsive; sentence variety supports the paddle cadence. Figurative language is selective—“backlash of regrets hit him in waves” anchors extended metaphor without clutter. One paraphrase loop (“broken… but merrily melancholic”) is minor. Closure sentence breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “yellowed and worn, bearing a signature that predated the century” does triple duty (age, anomaly, timeline rupture). Metaphors stay coherent—glass that bends—without mixed stacks. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. A single filter-verb cluster (“she understood then that…”) is brief enough to avoid momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Varied sentence lengths mirror the spice spirals; no scaffold or synonym loops; only one mixed metaphor cluster (“cosmic intimacy pressed against her skin”) but clarity remains intact through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies from crystalline fragments to the long breath of the unfastening sentence, matching ritual crescendo. Information density high: single sentence often fuses sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“the saucer crack glowed with inner light, serving as the vessel”). No mixed metaphors; cloud/ribcage/dew share liquidity imagery. Minor scaffold: “time…accumulated…accumulating” within 3 lines costs −0.2, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often paints setting, emotion, and stakes (“breath clouding in the cold” overlays body, temperature, isolation). Metaphor strings serve pattern, not clutter—tears→salt→filament→light. No synonym churn; each “stitch” gains new physicality. Minor cadence repetition in “he drifted higher, continuing to stitch” but occurs mid-sequence, not at closure; artifact does not touch final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with jar releases; sentences vary opening vectors, no template cadence. Occasional stacked metaphors (“threadbare coat pooling like spilled ink”) flirt with density but serve the accumulative pattern and never obscure causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “patina warm against her palm” fuses texture and emotional anchoring; “geometrically inevitable” marries math and fate. No scaffold loops; each clause advances position or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“cradle of sparks” reappears as literal birthplace), paid off in final line. Minor filter verbs tolerated (“she could almost hear”) because they serve hush-tone.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors are intentionally cosmic (“borrowed hues of morning,” “collapsed star dust”) and stay within the herder’s lexicon. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve by concrete image. High-band control with only hairline risk in stacked cosmic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; figurative density is high but pattern-taught (development metaphor) and paid off at closure. One scaffold phrase—“furiously tranquil resolve” repeated—slips through, not enough to dull final image. Strong verbs anchor sentences; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; no template churn. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light through prism, crimson regret—paid off in final gleam of needle. Information density high: “Danish tin sewing needle card” compresses nationality, material, purpose in five syllables. Micro-scaffold spotted once (“the two philosophers sheathed their blades, the dignified chaos…”) but does not touch closure; still blocks 9+ under artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (“luminous fracture,” “molting personalities”) stay coherent and sparse. Two near-adjacent “sorted/sorting” repeats are the only micro-loop, not enough to dull momentum. Line density is high; each sentence advances image or beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence fronts avoid drumbeat. Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor services navigation (cloud-mist, tidal arbor, aerial deep) and never contradicts physics. Zero paraphrase loops; only micro-repetition (“flickering compasses”) is motif-driven. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensorium, backstory, and causal push.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry triple duty (action, sensory data, world rule) with natural rhythmic variation; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“petals spiraling…sentience rather than wind”—and never clutters the high-pressure storm beat. One micro-slip: “empirically whimsical precision” appears twice; the repetition is noticeable but does not touch closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and tide-like surge; figurative language is dense but controlled by the accumulative design—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “rhythmically placid intervals” appears twice in opening and closing; otherwise zero paraphrase churn, high propulsion, clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“physics screams,” “dark equations”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “gradual change made visible” followed by “decay that whispered” slightly redundantly. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but figurative density in mid-story risks muddling clarity—though payoff in closure redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“red rock that looked like frozen flame”) is consistent and purposeful, never muddled. Minor scaffold in “steadily adaptive” repetition (twice within 10 lines) slightly dulls immediacy, but no loops, purple prose, or syntactic monotony. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—measured, resonant, inevitable. Read-aloud cadence is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information economy: “suspended cold,” “thermal signatures of human emotion,” “frozen emotional topography” all do triple duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (frost flowers → thermal auroras) and pays off in closure. One minor slip: “surgical precision” slightly jars with the organic thermal motif, but it’s redeemed by immediate grounding in “phantom limbs.” No loops, no scaffold—every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Final line (“finally reconciled with the quiet”) resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as location, ocean as wound) and pays off at closure without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies purposefully (“The water accepted her ankles, then her waist, then closed above her head…”). Final line—“and finally slept”—resonates because it’s earned by the preceding accumulation of exhaustion and resolve, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “amplified quiet of the ridge made every snapped twig sound like gunfire” does atmosphere, stakes, and sensory work. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. One minor density slip: “gently persistent rhythm that refused to let the community fracture” slightly abstracts, but immediately grounded by “backpack heavy with parcels.” Closure image remains sharp, unblurred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, varied rhythm, and high information density. Sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in the middle third (“foggy lucidity where edges blur but meaning sharpens” recurs conceptually), and “pilgrim of sparks” leans slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “breathing spaces between what we remember and what we dare to release” risks near-thematic summarization. Still, the final image lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but purposeful; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cascade of yesterday's geometries superimposed upon today's verdant architecture”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but figurative language remains coherent (light = memory = geometry). No loops or scaffold; high information density. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, closing the textual loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “feathers not from any living bird, but pressed from the seed-pods of extinct prairie grasses” conveys ecology, loss, and ingenuity in one phrase. Minor scaffold in “she had accepted voluntarily when the world above still had music” slightly abstracts, but momentum never stalls. Figurative language is coherent (arrow fletching casts “shadows that looked like growing things”), and sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence—“carrying the arrow and the promise of green shoots”—resolves with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “shipwrecks encircled the structure like a rusted crown, their hulls bleeding iron into the soil where roots once drank light from above”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm varies naturally. One minor slip: “the aurora shift from G-sharp to a blue-gray chord that tasted of copper” slightly overloads senses, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final line (“breaking it sounds like finally exhaling”) delivers perfect closure with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without muddle. Minor overwriting in “heart pressing against her ribs like a fist trying to reach through flesh to press your ear against destiny's door”—the mixed metaphor slightly strains logic. Otherwise, sentence variety, concrete verbs (“slipped,” “leaned,” “curved”), and rhythmic pacing serve momentum. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hydration” reframing boiling snow). Minor overwriting in peak beats—“weighty lightness” slightly abstract, and “fragile grammar of drips” borders on mixed metaphor—but clarity holds. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “Outside…”, “This was…”). Final line (“carrying nothing but the weight of what she had released”) earns its lyricism through prior embodiment. One paraphrase near-miss (“safe zones” / “transparent shelters”) but not repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: most lines advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful (“stars like crushing weight”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “transformative betrayal that cut both ways” slightly abstracts, but closure beat remains sharp. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or purple prose in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—gold leaf “shedding memories like scales,” darkness “rising like ink dispersing”—but avoids overwriting through consistent metaphor logic. Sentence openings vary (“Rain had turned…”, “Above, when…”, “She clutched…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor flaws: two adjacent sentences restate the storm’s role as “punctuation” (paraphrase loop), and “viscous like honey, others sharp as broken flint” slightly strains the silence-as-substance metaphor. No artifacts touch closure, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield. Figurative language (“captured whisper,” “frost patterns into mathematical proofs”) serves theme without muddle. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with emotional arc. Minor risk: “remarkably composed” recurs, but functions as motif, not scaffold. No paraphrase loops or register drift; closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.5)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“graphite scratches… transformed the chaotic lines into something ambiguously clear”), rhythmic variation, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is precise and consistent—the “crystal whispering forecourt” motif evolves without muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence (“focus could change everything”) echoes the projector lens’s function, closing the loop with propulsion. No filter-verb stacks, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasional overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., “cracked down their centers like frozen lightning” slightly strains metaphor coherence). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful (e.g., transition to western wall). Final third avoids artifacts, though “calcified promises” edges toward abstraction. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, with strong verbs (“knitted,” “exhaled”) outweighing modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “chronometer… hesitated at the forty-fourth mark” implies temporal anomaly without exposition). Minor overwriting in “consciousness bleeding between temporal layers like ink diffusing through water”—the simile slightly over-explains. Otherwise, rhythm modulates with tension: staccato during activation, lyrical in closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the hush of unstruck chords” does thematic, atmospheric, and emotional work. Figurative language is coherent (water as both barrier and medium; stains as syllables) with no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror rising/falling action. One minor slip: “organic decay” slightly abstracts, but it’s immediately grounded by “raised fibers where the ink had bled.” No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding. Each sentence multitasks: “the anemometer's shadow stretched... like a finger pointing toward the margins” establishes setting, motif, and psychological state. Figurative language is coherent (auroral sorrow, watercolor washes) and never muddles causality. One minor slip: “logarithmic records” slightly overreaches technical specificity, but doesn’t obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“static into the damp air like a spiritualist summoning ectoplasm”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (leviathan spine, stone in sternum); no mixed metaphors or purple prose. Paragraphs vary rhythmically, and the final line (“exact tonnage Elias had confessed”) resonates without redundancy. Minor scaffold in “drowsy alertness” repetition, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, varied in rhythm, and high in information density. Each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“crumbling peace that surrounds her” slightly redundant), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent—vines, folds, silt, lichen all serve the same ecological metaphor. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes the opening, closing the loop without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figurative: “roots remembered ancient stories in their slow cellular language” risks abstraction. A few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“quiet persistence of growth that continued even when unseen” / “music remains… we are already complete”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, the density of poetic modifiers in high-pressure beats (e.g., “cautiously exuberant, hopeful but never demanding”) slightly blurs immediacy. Still, rhythm supports the accumulative design, and the final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“concrete curves now shelving miles of books,” “dragons coiled around a tree that bore fruit like stars”) with varied sentence rhythm and strong verbs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (dragons = axis, walls = memory) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “fevered script of someone who had witnessed the final dreams evaporate like morning fog”—mixed vehicle—but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“modulating his existence from the minor chord of isolation into something major and bright”) and varied rhythm. Minor artifact: slight overuse of musical metaphor in peak beats (“key change in a long symphony,” “notes will resolve”), risking figurative saturation, though coherence holds. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line lands with perfect propulsion, recharging the transposition motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gray so absolute it seemed to drink the candlelight” conveys color, light behavior, and metaphysical weight). Figurative language is consistent—sonic and textile metaphors interweave without contradiction. Minor overwriting in “harmonic argument that filled the space without shattering the muffled clarity” slightly blurs causality, but closure remains sharp. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without sufficient pattern-teaching payoff, risking overwriting. Phrases like “visible chords and melodies made manifest in color” verge on synesthetic abstraction that slightly dulls the closure’s physical grounding. No loops or scaffolding, but the density occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but purposeful—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“squirmed like living things,” “darkening brightness creating a paradoxical luminescence”) risks slight figurative saturation, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold; final image lands with clean propulsion. One paraphrase near climax (“fractured timelines... ghost images”) slightly dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gloves made of stone against her own soul,” “emotion pooled like water in cupped hands.” Figurative language is coherent (hush as filament, needle as starlight) and never muddles peak beats. Minor deduction for one near-loop: “shattered heart back into feeling” slightly echoes earlier “emotional numbness,” but not enough to dull closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm serve emotional cadence perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, varied, and purposeful: “shadows pooled like ink,” “static in her copper antennas,” “greenhouse for facts.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (weather as truth metaphor) and never muddled. Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes with the rain’s arrival, closing on “the wind”—a charged, quiet cadence. Minor deduction only for slight over-compression in the mentor’s backstory (handled efficiently but briefly).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“trapped butterflies made of sapphire and frost”) is coherent and purposeful, not overwritten. Minor artifact: slight synonym proximity in “grief” descriptors (“unprocessed grief,” “irreplaceable loss”), but no loops or scaffolding. Final paragraph’s cadence (“He was simply alive…”) resolves with earned lyricism, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“sheets of silk burning with internal starlight,” “clay… soft as the present moment”—and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in the middle third (“passionate in his subtlety, believing that truth emerged…”), where figurative density slightly slows propulsion, but never obscures causality. The final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors the theme: rough, inconsistent, gloriously incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information density—e.g., “barnacles on the glass” conveys time, tide, and texture in three words. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “magnificent simplicity” appears twice, slightly diluting impact; “radiantly undone” edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (sound as ghost, silence as hostage). Final paragraph avoids purple prose by grounding epiphany in physical sensation: “warm in her palms,” “singing with retained heat.” Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully, though one or two stacked modifiers (“salt-bleached wood,” “waterlogged wood”) flirt with excess.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: “resinous walls glowing with captured sunsets that refused to fade” establishes setting, mood, and thematic tension in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (static as neural breath, empathy as silk around a knife). Minor deduction for slightly stacked modifiers in “synthetic sorrow and manufactured joy,” but no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “boots heavy with the day's commerce” conveys profession, fatigue, and thematic weight in seven words. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring emotional cadence. However, three adjacent sentences in the final paragraph use parallel structure (“every envelope... every mistake... every ending symphony...”), creating a templated cadence that slightly dulls the climax. Also, “tempest-tossed” and “tongue-tied” lean on alliteration over specificity. These are minor artifacts but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“fossilize in the glacial soil” borders on purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor—“webs of kinship... stronger than volcanic glass”—slightly muddles the physical logic. Closure remains unharmed, but this prevents a 9+ score per Q7’s artifact guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (e.g., “copper sky,” “temporal amber”) without muddle. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sculpted time itself, carving seconds…”) slightly dilutes clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “pale and sweet without sun,” “roots had woven themselves into nets,” “dovetail joint formed in his understanding.” Figurative language is coherent (light/gravity, water/stone, math/grief) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “spectral equations” risks abstraction but is immediately grounded by tactile action. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally across paragraph lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ferromagnetic tape reel fragments curled like metallic insects” does triple duty—image, texture, metaphor. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the second paragraph (“arteries,” “vessels,” “insects”) risks density overload, but payoff in closure redeems it. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; every line advances character, setting, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information economy: “roots cracking through concrete” conveys physical and psychological rupture in five words. Figurative language is consistent (botanical metaphors never clash) and purposeful. One minor slip: “circuitously sincere” borders on coined abstraction, but its recurrence grounds it. No loops, no scaffold—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line’s “leaf by leaf” echoes the opening’s stamen-counting, closing the textual circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “salt ate her canvases from behind,” “clay that smelled of rust and ancient cellars.” Figurative language is consistent (erosion, burial, preservation) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “golden coffin” and “eternally alive,” but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic cadence—steady, exhausted, resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “shadow stretching across three different crystal facets simultaneously” conveys spatial, visual, and thematic layers in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Figurative language is consistent (music/light/darkness motifs) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “steadily unpredictable” repetition (twice) slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “ivory harbor after rain” conveys setting, mood, and thematic texture in five words. Figurative language is controlled (“stones resembling bones,” “voices silenced by time”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “compile fragments into meaning” phrasing, but it serves thematic reinforcement rather than redundancy. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the closing image lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: “spiderwebbing across the platform in deliberate arrows” conveys motion, intent, and precision in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (cracks as language, train as “forgotten appointments”). Minor overwriting in “fortress of unspoken truths” (slightly abstract), but closure beat (“map finally complete”) avoids muddle. No loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense and propulsive, with sentences often doing triple duty (e.g., “The salt wind cut through the open dome” establishes setting, mood, and physical sensation). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors—but the phrase “emotional architecture of observation” edges toward abstraction, slightly muddying the peak beat. One minor paraphrase loop: “rhythmic crash of waves and something older, deeper” echoes later as “starlight and cetacean longing,” though this serves lyric resonance. Otherwise, syntax varies adeptly, and paragraph cuts heighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“space convulsed violently, throwing off its mathematical shackles”) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with pressure, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“corridors where Euclidean logic broke down and parallel timelines bled together like watercolors”)—a slight density overload—but clarity remains intact. No artifacts dull the closure; the final lines resonate with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“oil on dark water,” “sugar in warm rain”) and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold in “cosmic inversion that made Maya’s mathematically honest mind ache”—slightly abstract, but immediately grounded in action. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence; rhythm varies naturally, especially in the climactic movement through shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (refraction, texture, pressure) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests… frozen lightning”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors the shift from labor to stillness, with “gold edges catching the dawn” crystallizing the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“salt wind eroded the paint in patterns that matched the neural map of their peculiar sight”). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (texture metaphors recur without muddle). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Twelve years prior…”, “Across the rhythm…”, “When the high tide…”). Minor overwriting in mid-text (“layered substance upon the void”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gloomy cheerfulness settled over her like a familiar blanket”). Figurative language is consistent—light, sound, and texture motifs interweave without muddle. Minor scaffold in “reimagined her last conversation... rewriting the script” slightly paraphrases, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic release, varying sentence length to echo breath and bow strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “salt-crusted community,” “fractured mask,” “stone breaking waves” all advance character, theme, and plot. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “brassy and defiant” (adjective stacking), but rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line recharges the foundation stone motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density (“fusion-glass veins that webbed the crater floor”), varied sentence openings, and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (light “sliced,” shadows “bled,” drills “screamed”) without purple excess. The final paragraph’s cadence—descending with Elena as mystery burns away—resonates without scaffold. Minor deduction only for one slightly over-modified phrase (“vacuum-sealed quiet that made her heart seem thunderous”), but it serves emotional escalation without muddling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“steam from departing locomotives blended with coastal fog... creating perpetual twilight”) and varied sentence structure. Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (“feedback loops screaming in electronic confusion”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm supports propulsion. Final paragraph’s lyricism feels earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “corrugated skin shedding flakes of iron into snow that had not melted in three decades” establishes setting, time, and decay in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (condensation as tributary map, phrasebook as compass) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every image serves escalation or closure. Minor deduction only for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-text, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density (“mortar spontaneously regenerated in the cracks”), varied sentence openings, and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the story’s heartbeat. Figurative language is coherent—light-absorbing fork, frost-like notes, amber-glowing street—all within the established logic of resonant restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes momentum: “darkness pooled like ink” and “emerald fireflies” border on decorative. The phrase “softly ingenious” appears twice without evolving function, and “rhythm of belonging” recurs with slight variation, risking paraphrase-loop. However, sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and key lines (“breath fogging the surface in perfect unison”) carry high information density. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; artifacts are minor and don’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled, with high information density: “crater glass formed from ancient meteor strikes” conveys origin, texture, and function in one phrase. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“spinning theories between hums, wondering why certain pathways...”), where two adjacent sentences restate her conjecture.

Final line’s meteor simile crystallizes the closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme—but occasional figurative stacking slightly dulls propulsion (e.g., “moss that grew thicker than memory” followed immediately by “garden suspended above a sea of clouds”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. One minor artifact: “interrupted cadence” repeats three times with slight variation, bordering on motif reinforcement but risking template cadence. Final paragraph’s lyricism remains clear, though “transiently rooted between the moment that had passed and the silence that would follow” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “each perforation a letter in a name, a note in a life, a breath suspended in paper” does triple duty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “simply complicated paradox that tangled her present in knots of predestination” borders on self-referential abstraction. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, two adjacent lines (“She had come to inquire, but found instead a mirror…”) verge on paraphrase-loop. The final third avoids artifacts, but the phrase “brightened disquiet” appears three times—functional as motif, yet slightly repetitive in close proximity.

One near-miss: “unkindled solace” slightly abstract but grounded by physical fog.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“three-dimensional manuscript written in hemp and silk”), and sentences vary in length and structure to mirror the pendulum’s swing. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “manipulating the negative space within the braids” edges toward abstraction, and “temporal architecture that supported the university’s very foundations” risks grandiosity. No paraphrase loops, but one or two stacked modifiers dilute immediacy. Still, momentum never stalls, and the final lines land with clarity and quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“bloom of hush,” “hammered repose”) and pays off without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density and rhythmic variety serve pressure without overwriting—though “stretching contracted” appears three times, it’s a deliberate motif, not a loop. Minor figurative density in peak beats (“gravity's betrayal became a blessing,” “silence tasted of honey and dust”) risks slight opacity but pays off thematically. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves with earned resonance, though “intangibly tangible” borders on label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is masterful: sentences vary rhythmically, paragraph lengths breathe with the scene’s tension, and every image serves multiple functions (e.g., storm glass both forecasts weather and mirrors emotional states). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high without clutter. One minor flaw: “vaulting hush” appears three times, bordering on motif overuse, though it remains purposeful. Final lines land with clean propulsion, no artifacts dulling closure.

Final line (“shadows no longer threatened to seam but instead promised to hold”) perfectly recharges the opening’s tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, rhythmic control, and high information density (e.g., “vanilla scent of aging deceit” conveys setting, mood, and theme). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms propulsion—nearly every sentence in the first paragraph contains metaphor (“exhaled dust motes,” “evening stretched its first yawn”), risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “eloquently silent” repeats verbatim, creating slight redundancy. Final third remains clean, avoiding artifact penalties, though the lyric intensity borders on purple in mid-section (“oscillating silence into comprehension”).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (“boots crunching on crystallized shadow” conveys setting, sound, and metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught (mercury = potential; armor = isolation) and pays off without muddle.

No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful metaphor (“silence so profound it had weight and texture”), yet avoids overwriting through precise verbs (“poured,” “stirred,” “swallowed”). Minor redundancy in “quietly vivid” appearing twice slightly dilutes impact, and “vested hush” borders on neologistic opacity. However, rhythm varies skillfully, paragraph lengths breathe with tension, and final lines land with haunting clarity. One paraphrase loop (“ghost of melodies never born” / “memory of silence”) costs 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information-per-line. Sentences vary in length and structure to mirror emotional arcs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“slow-burning embers,” “wet, ancient joy”) slightly dilutes clarity, but no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Final paragraph’s cadence (“orderly, forever wild”) lands with earned resonance. One paraphrase near “monuments… receivers” could tighten, but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“bronze that parted to reveal a stone staircase”), varied sentence openings, and paragraph cuts that heighten momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves character or pressure. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in the waterfall description (“chaotic music she could not transcribe”), but it doesn’t obscure causality. Final line (“the mechanism sang a note it had held silent for twenty years”) perfectly resolves the opening’s broken-clock motif with emotional propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rainwater dripped… with a chiming finality” establishes rhythm and stakes immediately. Figurative language is coherent—light bends, names have weight, regret is luminous—all within the story’s physics. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“balancing acids and starlight”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure lines (“evaporate from his golden scars”) recover with crystalline clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “strings tuned to intervals that would make a music master weep” conveys neglect, character, and function. Figurative language is coherent—smoke, fabric, tapestry—all serve the sonic motif. Minor overwriting in “luminous ache of unfinished stories” risks abstraction, but it’s grounded by immediate context. Final line’s metronome simile perfectly recharges the tooth’s earlier introduction. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (violet light as judgment, spine as combination lock) and coheres without muddle. Minor risk of overwriting in mid-paragraphs (“mathematics of her own survival calculated in neural pathways”), but propulsion remains strong. Final line—“a scar that measured exactly how much light could pass through a broken place”—resolves with crystalline specificity and zero redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “smoke that remembers it was once bone”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (lighthouse = revelation) and payoff-coherent. Minor overwriting in mid-story: “infinite presence” and “eternal instant” verge on abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors closure’s quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence multitasking: “boots crunching on vintage ticket stubs that littered the floor like expired confetti” establishes sound, texture, metaphor, and thematic decay. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; “helium balloon tugging at her sternum” perfectly encapsulates transformed burden. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The final line—“holding the mainspring of other people’s unfinished hours”—resonates without overstatement, closing the circuit with earned lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “metal teeth biting into paper that was actually compressed cloud-fiber” does three jobs at once. Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass = fragility/perfection) and payoff-earned (remembering it was sand). Minor overwriting in “fractal geometries of absolute stasis” slightly slows momentum, but closure beat (“finally allowed herself to breathe”) lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense but clear, each sentence advancing character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“visible time pooled like amber wine”) and pays off (“river of molten honey”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor risk: “burnished sorrow” borders on abstraction, but it’s anchored in voice and paid off in the council scene and final weeping.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (sound as light, rust as truth) and avoids muddle, though the phrase “stitching time itself with threads of audible light” risks slight overreach. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; paragraph cuts are precise. Minor deduction for one instance of stacked metaphor in a high-pressure beat, but clarity at closure remains uncompromised, and rhythm varies effectively to mirror the story’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “calcified lace,” “gravity seemed negotiable,” “clouds that fell rather than rose” do triple duty (image, mood, theme). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (petrichor as motif, hinges as structural metaphor) and peaks without muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm breathes with Elara’s acceptance—no overwriting, no purple prose, just calibrated lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“turbine-hum reverie,” “knots containing navigational mathematics”—and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“Mara clutched…”, “Inside the shelter…”, “She needed to…”) and paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. One minor flaw: the phrase “timewoven alliances” appears four times, bordering on incantatory repetition that slightly dulls novelty by the final paragraph. Otherwise, information density is high, with each line advancing character, theme, or atmosphere without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled and coherent—light “fractures into spectral roots,” snow pools “like mirrors of sky”—without muddle.

No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; information density is high without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (“clouds that tasted of salt and static,” “sediment becoming stone”). Minor overwriting in “searing reverie burning away the boundaries between archivist and casualty” edges toward abstraction, but most imagery is grounded. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s resonance (“brave enough to read the debris and remember”) avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing triple duty (e.g., “Magic had departed like tide-water, revealing the naked architecture of cause and effect beneath the glamorous illusions” conveys plot, theme, and atmosphere). Minor overwriting in one beat (“rotating the town's history like a complex equation requiring violent solution”) edges toward mixed metaphor but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“lanterns floated upward... flickered with the uncertainty of effort”) is crystalline. Paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing knowledge or emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept without scaffold.

Read-aloud ear test passes with haunting musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is rich but coherent—pollen vortex, entropy as dance, time as taffy—without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weaving quantum probabilities back into seeds”) slightly risks abstraction, but remains grounded in tactile verbs. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure image (“stars themselves seemed to sprout leaves”) is earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “hemp fibers singing a different song than copper wiring” merges metaphor and function. Minor overwriting in “windblown sanctuary above the clouds had been built by monks who understood…” slightly dilutes propulsion. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence breathes with earned calm, though “credibly curious” recurs without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“scattering light like seeds across the dark soil of space”) risks slight overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line recharges the opening motif. A minor register drift occurs in “flourishing stillness,” which edges toward therapy-speak, but it’s grounded by immediate physical context (his chest, the garden).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “waxen corridors now home to dust instead of wings” conveys loss, profession, and ecology in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—honeycomb as sediment, silence as architecture—and avoids purple excess. Minor scaffold in “tranquilly perceptive” risks label-speak but is immediately embodied in observational detail. Final paragraph’s cadence (“ghosts began to fade… permanent stains upon air”) varies sentence length to mirror dawn’s retreat, with zero paraphrase loops or register drift. One near-redundancy (“fractured rainbows across the cracked earth” / “refracting them into patterns”) slightly dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “borrowed increments, stolen moments from the collapsing timeline that she hoarded like a miser clutching fading photographs” advances character, theme, and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent—time as fabric, linen, sediment—without mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “she had spent her existence maintaining a clockwork that no longer needed winding” slightly paraphrases prior ideas, but no loops or artifacts dull the closure beat. Final line (“endless texture of the moment that would never end yet always begin anew”) masterfully varies rhythm and recharges motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“bruised with clouds,” “green flame”) and high information density—most lines advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent descriptions of the feather’s damage, verging on paraphrase-loop, and the phrase “burnished hush” recurs with slight redundancy. No scaffold or template cadence; figurative language remains coherent and physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “subterranean tides few humans could perceive,” “cancer consuming his lungs with patient hunger.” Figurative language is coherent (copper as “universal translator,” pillars as “calcified neural networks”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “he wrapped wire around… then… then…” sequence, but purposeful accumulation, not loop. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors closure—long, breath-like sentences tapering into peaceful death. No purple prose; every image serves theme or character.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“bronze quiet,” “sky became a doorway”) is consistent and clarifying, not muddled. Minor scaffold appears in “dissident researchers who had abandoned the sanctioned study centers to pursue this artificial pilgrimage”—a slight explanatory drag—but it’s brief and necessary for context. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph propels to closure without overwriting, though “refusing to let the amber set completely around their wondering minds” edges toward mixed metaphor (amber as both preserver and hardening agent).

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with syntactic variety and strong verbs (“crunching,” “detonate,” “siege”). Figurative language is pattern-taught: “narrow vastness” recurs to frame scale, “submerged concord” evolves from concept to covenant. No paraphrase loops; each image advances atmosphere or character. Minor overwriting in “genetic memory of forests that had stood before the wars” slightly dilutes immediacy, but the closure beat (“conquering death with the quiet persistence of grammar”) is flawless—rhythmic, resonant, and thematically charged. High information density without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot (e.g., “paws knew the rhythm of rust and regret” establishes history and setting in seven words). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“intuitively descriptive” recurs meaningfully) and payoff-earned. One paraphrase loop: “translating distance into closeness” appears twice within 100 words, slightly dulling momentum. Otherwise, syntactic variety, strong verbs (“devoured all delicate mechanics”), and sensory specificity avoid overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“breath forming crystals that fell slowly through temporally stretched air”) with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (temporal metaphors grounded in physics) and pays off at closure. One minor flaw: slight overwriting in “taffy-like resistance” risks purple prose, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“sky is wrong,” “aurora bled away”) and pays off in closure. Rhythm varies effectively—staccato during peril, lyrical during ritual. One paraphrase loop: “cautious abandon” appears twice, slightly diluting its impact. No filter-verb stacks, no simultaneity errors, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Deduction for minor overwriting: “fractal patterns,” “impossible geometries,” “cosmic game” approach stacked modifiers, though cohesion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-perfect information economy: “nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless,” “walking that spelled words” each do multiple jobs. Figurative language is consistent (light/absence motifs) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the opening sentence—“interregnum, that hollow space…” borders on explanatory—but quickly recovers. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph’s cadence delivers closure without flourish. Read-aloud test passes with haunting clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“breathing dust and ink instead of air”). Figurative language is coherent (mercury as grief, thunder as roots) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in “ten thousand unread spines” slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“finally comprehending...”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “woven hush” does atmospheric, thematic, and sensory work. Minor overwriting in “frayed threads in a tapestry's border” (slightly redundant), but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language coheres (velvet silence, sediment-clearing realization). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors release—longer sentences, softer consonants—without sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety supports emotional arc: short, fractured lines during tension (“They had sought to refract… yet clung”), longer cadences for reflection. Figurative language is dense but coherent—“seeds” of sound, “prismatic shards,” “forged hush”—all extending the core metaphor without muddle. One minor slip: “defiant artist” appears twice in close proximity, risking label-repetition. Otherwise, high information density with no paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “ash drifting like snow” conveys loss, season, and fragility). Figurative language is coherent—gold as liquid light, grief as Braille—and avoids purple excess. Minor deduction: slight overuse of em-dashes in middle section slightly disrupts cadence, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors descent: longer sentences fracturing into “held her breath one final time.”

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density: “the mirror had cracked, yes, and the reflection he had known was gone” compresses backstory, metaphor, and emotional state in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (light as frozen lightning, stalactites as teeth, stalagmites as masts) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with scene rhythm. One minor slip: “intimately aloof” slightly risks abstraction, but it’s immediately grounded in action (“pretending not to love her already”). No loops, scaffolds, or register drift—every line propels atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional: varied syntax, high information density (“screaming tenderness of withheld breath”), and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught (vibrations, scent, light) and payoff-earned; no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight over-density in the opening paragraph (“fever dream,” “iron and relief,” “screaming tenderness” in rapid succession)—beautiful but momentarily overwhelming. Otherwise, propulsion is relentless, every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes without scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“skin grafted over titanium ribs,” “lighthouse had stopped breathing”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful: metaphors of salvage, tide, and static interlock without contradiction. Minor overwriting in one beat (“raw solace—unpolished, grinding, honest”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length and syntactic diversity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “her harness creaking against the ropes of the ancient orchard that clung to the cliffs like a desperate prayer” does setting, character, and tone in one breath. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storms as occlusion, mycelium as shield) and pays off at closure. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but no artifacts dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“memories… grafted onto her solitude like lichen on stone”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “pearl and ghost” twilight description slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes opening, and sentence variety supports emotional arc. One near-redundancy (“softly persistent waves… softly persistent fog”) triggers a −0.3 artifact penalty, preventing 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “red clay into treacherous soup,” “nectar that smelled of old paper and typewriter ribbon.” Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “empirically intuitive” (slightly abstract) but immediately grounded in ant observation. Final paragraph avoids loops; every sentence advances closure. Near-perfect information density, though one or two modifiers (“achingly familiar”) edge toward convention.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “sky that wept liquid light onto empty crowns” conveys setting, emotion, and prophecy in one image. Minor overwriting in the grotto description (“not quite blue and not quite black”) slightly muddles the visual, but figurative language remains coherent. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm. No loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final firefly image pays off earlier “ember” motif with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is masterful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“scientifically romantic” recurs meaningfully) and coheres physically (light as both photon and emotional weight). Minor overwriting appears in one beat: “revaluing the raw photons by returning them differently through the calcified mathematics of the shell's interior” slightly strains clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line (“heavier than gold and lighter than breath”) perfectly encapsulates the thematic paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is luminous and precise, with high information density—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting in one beat (“teeth sharper than grief”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Closure image (“snowflake landing on stone”) is crystalline, though one mixed metaphor (“hot air balloon lifting him… ouroboros”) risks slight muddle—hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gray watercolor washes,” “silver comma suspended in amniotic fluid,” “metronomic patience” all advance character and theme. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence multitasks. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in mid-story (“archaeologist of the visible,” “sacred in the measurable drip”)—not muddled, but momentarily ornamental. Final paragraph earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity, and the last line lands with devastating simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “crystallized memories accumulated in small, glittering piles of narrative potential” does triple duty (image, theme, plot). Minor artifact: “crow quill trimmed tip” repeats slightly awkwardly three times—could vary phrasing—but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops; rhythm varies naturally (short staccato beats during inscription, lyrical flow in reflection). Final line (“readings from the text of her own survival”) resonates without overwriting. One near-miss: “bruised purple light” borders on cliché but is redeemed by specificity (“filtering through the cloud deck below”).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“dust motes swam like silver fish,” “cello strings scraping against regret”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weaving meaning like copper wire... lacked the voltage necessary for miracles”) slightly dilutes propulsion. Otherwise, syntactic variety, strong verbs, and concrete imagery maintain momentum to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears in peak beats (“luminous dust,” “geological time,” “semantic stubbornness” clustered without pattern-teaching). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but minor figurative stacking (“cooling embers of the last stars” alongside “heat death”) slightly muddles sensory clarity. Final paragraph maintains propulsion and avoids purple excess, landing the closure with clean, resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“water dripping with metronomic indifference to his quest”). Figurative language is coherent—“frozen second” snowflakes, “hydraulic resistance of being alive”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “eminently peculiar” repetition (three times), but it’s motif-driven, not scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the whistle’s cessation: breath released, silence embraced. No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“quiet wildfire,” “galaxy of blue-green stars”) is purposeful and consistent, never muddling clarity. Minor overwriting in “phosphorescent rhythm” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffolds, or register drift mar peak beats. Final paragraph’s cadence (“light the darkness and then release”) lands with earned resonance, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fracture, water, light) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in one beat: “statistical likelihoods administered by paramedics who played the odds correctly” slightly drifts into explanatory register. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are precise, and information density is high—e.g., “mica pane glowed amber in her canvas bag, a mineral window that fractured light into parallel possibilities” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “the receiver that breathed glass harmonica tones into their panic” merges object, action, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—long, looping sentences for accumulation; abrupt fragments for severance (“She disconnected”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances character or texture. Figurative language is coherent: the disc’s “spectral music looping without end” ties to “loop of history,” avoiding muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “weaving a tapestry of almost-connections that she dissolved before they could scar”—“scar” risks abstraction, though context grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “flowers… releasing spores that tasted of old photographs” establishes setting, stakes, and sensory logic). Figurative language is coherent: ink “steeped in grief,” memories “sedimented into pilings,” euphoria “dissolving like wet sugar.” Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph lengths vary purposefully (long for reflection, short for urgency). Final line (“preparing her heart for the next blooming”) recharges the jetty’s cyclical logic without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “ivy... curling through ticket machines like green fingers grasping yesterday's departures” merges image, motion, and metaphor without clutter. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for slight overuse of figurative language in the opening beat (“green fingers,” “grasping yesterday’s departures”), but payoff in the ivy’s later “shiver” justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dialects older than human grief” conveys history, tone, and mystery in six words). Figurative language is coherent—vibrations as language, emotions as topography—and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“sap rising through cambium, of leaves photosynthesizing hope”) slightly slows momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic closure, earning high density without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“metal unbending from positions it had held for decades” conveys time, pressure, and consequence). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“time folded like origami,” “starlight pooled like mercury”) and paid off in closure. Minor overwriting in “recursive loops, dooming the expedition to endless circling” slightly bloats an otherwise lean beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length and sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: “silvering the fishing boats,” “milky eyes,” “joyful sorrow” each do triple duty. Rhythm modulates expertly—measured cadence for mapping, accelerando for conducting. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. One minor overwriting: “tapestry of negative space” slightly strains, but doesn’t blur the closure’s clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“charcoal from the library embers” conveys material, history, and transformation), but occasional overwriting appears: “surgical precision that only an analytically intuitive eye would recognize as coded preservation” edges toward explanatory. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “volcanic tenderness” repeats slightly more than needed. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates appropriately, and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor deduction for one mixed metaphor (“smoke clung to meaning like incense waiting to be inhaled by the worthy”) that slightly blurs sensory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “fingers found the hollow resonance” establishes setting, character, and method in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as aurora, breath as universe inhaling) and payoff-consistent. Minor overwriting in “quantum foam of their joined recollection”—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery—but doesn’t dull closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: “auroras dancing where navigation satellites once hummed” compresses loss, beauty, and obsolescence in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“sky bruised purple and green”) and consistent with Kael’s tactile worldview. Final paragraph’s cadence—long sentence for lore, short for command, lyrical for closure—propels without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (light as language, darkness as student) and payoff-driven. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“spiralingly calm insistence,” “tapestry of silver”), slightly muddying propulsion. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “spiralingly calm” recurs as a near-tic—costing full 9+ eligibility per artifact guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “regrets reconsidered, arguments paused, harsh words held back” compresses emotional transformation into rhythmic triad. Figurative language is consistent (sediment, forests, constellations) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “magnetic grotto beneath the old observatory” slightly stalls momentum, but the final paragraph’s cadence—“one window at a time, one breath at a time”—perfectly mirrors the theme of incremental change.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“hands trailing across barnacle-crusted pylons” establishes setting, character, and mood). Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths mirror tidal ebb/flow. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“blazed with etchings showing the island rising”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“echo of a grace that had never belonged on land”) perfectly recharges the opening motif.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally veers toward overwriting (“rigor of suspended decay,” “sacramental filling”). The metaphors largely cohere—the turbine shadows as second hands, the bird as broken-winged ambiguity—but the phrase “architecture of continuation” risks abstraction. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No loops or scaffold, but one or two modifiers lean decorative rather than necessary, slightly dulling propulsion in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“lantern-moth hush,” “humming quartz”) and paid off in closure. However, two adjacent sentences slightly paraphrase the same idea: “to stride through boundaries… to prove that poetry could reshape…” and later “to stride through boundaries… she had become the very thing…” This creates a minor synonym loop. Also, peak beats lean heavily on metaphor without grounding verbs in some lines (“writing herself across the white expanse in characters that melted and refroze”), risking slight opacity. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraph propels with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cooling silica and scorched earth” establishes post-phoenix atmosphere in six words; “glass-berries and ash-daisies” compress worldbuilding into botany. Sentence rhythm varies—long flowing clauses for contemplation, short staccato phrases for revelation (“Marin wept”). One minor flaw: “warped but intact” slightly redundantly modifies the reed, but this doesn’t obscure closure. Figurative language remains coherent (heat as texture, sound as visual ripple), avoiding purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bronze prism pagoda materialized” merges setting/action; “golden fireflies” concretizes nostalgia. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“violence and grace, destruction and preservation”) borders on stacked modifiers but avoids muddle. Sentence openings vary (“She approached…”, “At twilight…”, “The pagoda chimed…”), and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase-loop risk (“anguished joy” appears twice) but is thematically charged, not redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (petals, shadows, stones) and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor scaffold: “softly deliberately” appears three times—twice close together—but functions as character tic and thematic refrain, not loop. No filter-verb stacks; emotions are embodied (“hands moved,” “sat back”). Final line resonates with opening (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer”), creating circular propulsion. One slight redundancy in “worked through the night… worked softly deliberately,” but cost is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “peeling away the layers of her complicity” does emotional, thematic, and narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “neural imprints,” “fiber-optic veins,” “scheduled battles” all do double duty. Rhythm varies effectively—long, breathless sentences for disorientation; clipped phrases for action. One paraphrase loop: “dizzying quiet” repeats three times with diminishing returns, slightly dulling the final reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“sequins like dried scales,” “whispering gleam”). Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“loomed,” “unlocked,” “germinate”) and specific nouns (“brass gears,” “birch forest”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“gleamed with a whispering gleam… speaking in soft gradients”) slightly muddles imagery but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; information density high, though one adjacent redundancy (“silence had never been his prison but his workshop” / “silently persistent nature had been a song”) nudges score down.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “shelves curved inward like Pringles chips” is vivid, specific, and thematically resonant. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with momentum.

Final lines propel closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but the pattern is taught early (“whispering archipelago,” “pages turning underwater”) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting occurs in the middle third (“colors that tasted of nostalgia and regret,” “vibrated in her ribs like a tuning fork struck against bone”)—beautiful but slightly redundant. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though two adjacent sentences restate the dream’s liminal nature. Crucially, the final paragraph avoids artifact: “luminous absence” lands with clarity and propulsion, and the closing cadence (“a dream no longer runaway, but vitalized into something new and everlasting”) earns its lyricism through prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stardust, breath, humming) and coheres without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose demonstrates high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes—but occasional overwriting dilutes peak beats. Phrases like “genetic memory passed down through twelve generations” and “essence of a child’s first laughter” verge on stacked abstraction despite vivid context. Minor scaffold appears in opening/closing refrains (“Upon the hush of budding hope”), though this lyric echo serves thematic resonance. No fatal loops or causality-obscuring artifacts; clarity holds through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (silence as substance, starlight as blade) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in mid-section (“labyrinthine rope that logic could not map” borders on abstraction), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph’s rhythm—“heavy, holy silence she had chosen to carry”—resolves the cadence with earned weight, though one or two modifiers (“spectral geometries,” “interlaced hush”) flirt with excess without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density (“perfume that energized her senses,” “shadows shifted... suggesting subsidence”). Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create rhythm. Minor overwriting in “rain-scoured fresco vault” slightly inflates diction but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “waterlogged cathedral of forgotten texts,” “surface tension and memory,” “electromagnetic impressions of his last thoughts.” Figurative language is coherent—physics metaphors sustain throughout without contradiction.

No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, high information density (“amber light bled,” “civilization's final exhalation”), and strategic telling. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“vouchsafe one final mercy” / “vouchsafing peace itself”) and figurative density peaks in the middle third with mixed metaphors (“quantum strings,” “gossamer chains,” “nested patterns”) that blur physical logic. No scaffold loops, but the final paragraph’s “refusing to flicker” / “gentle sigh” slightly over-clarifies an already resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “brass wings catching the dying light” conveys setting, time, and threat in one phrase.

Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution—clean, steady, evaporative.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line: “borrowed starlight streaming through the clock's massive stained-glass orrery” establishes setting, mood, and motif in one breath. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“guttural consonants… flowing liquid vowels… vigorous tender melody”) edges toward stacked modifiers, slightly blurring sense. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final clang “shakes ancient dust”—a concrete, resonant closure image. One paraphrase near climax (“mechanically rehabilitated… gears meshing again”) slightly dulls propulsion, but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion, but suffers from overwriting in high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence carries figurative language, creating density without always advancing causality. Minor paraphrase loops occur (e.g., “chaotically precise” repeated three times with slight variation), and mixed metaphors blur clarity (“synaptic plasticity burned… like wildfire through chaparral” clashes with “curator restoring frescoes”). The final paragraph tightens effectively, but earlier sections could benefit from strategic pruning to heighten momentum. No fatal artifacts, but the lyricism occasionally obscures emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose maintains high information density: “latent blaze—a suppressed heat that never quite ignited but warmed the air to feverish intensity” does triple duty (atmosphere, constraint, tone). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (luminosity, refraction, inversion). Minor overwriting in “serpentine tunnels twisted according to laws that only functioned during this temporal window”—slightly abstract—but doesn’t obscure causality.

Final line (“unfettered from neglect”) perfectly recharges the opening’s frozen stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, though figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “avalanchingly quiet” appears three times, bordering on motif-churn). No paraphrase loops, but “arranging driftwood as directional markers” repeats verbatim twice, creating slight scaffold drag. Final paragraph’s cadence is masterful, yet “bitter crop of her failure” leans toward cliché. Still, momentum and clarity remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“stars vanishing like missing teeth,” “grief counted in ledgers”—but avoids overwriting; each metaphor advances atmosphere or character. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with tension, and information density is high (e.g., “Garamond for the anxious poet” conveys font, personality, and Elara’s taxonomy in six words).

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“The green glass shard dissolved into her palm, becoming part of her cartographic senses”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, weaving, weight) and coheres without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of abstract nouns (“resonance of acceptance,” “gravity of unspoken things”) in the final paragraph, which risks bordering on label-speak, though still grounded in prior imagery. Rhythm varies effectively, and the opening/closing lines reframe the shard motif with earned resonance. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“rust bloomed like coastal flowers,” “letter folded tight as a fish’s spine”) and pays off in closure. No loops, no scaffold—every image serves the accumulative pressure. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-section (“residual presence of keepers who had drowned in their own vigilance” borders on ornamental), but never obscures causality or dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, musical, and largely free of loops—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (light as liquid, shadows as seeds) and coheres with the physics motif. However, two adjacent lines restate the wick’s function (“bouncing photons... pooled into liquid luminescence” / “reservoir of potential so dense it bent time”), creating a paraphrase loop. Also, “accidentally prophetic” appears three times with minimal variation, bordering on refrain but risking redundancy. These are minor but prevent 9+ line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “borrowed rhythm beneath ribs that still felt like foreign architecture” merges character, setting, and conflict. Figurative language is coherent (light as thread, stories as sediment) with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “quietly explosive truth detonate”—“detonate” slightly clashes with “soft expansion,” though intentional contrast. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line’s “became a star” risks cliché but earns freshness through prior iridescence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“brass legs splayed like a wounded insect,” “pollen on still water”), but avoids overwriting—each metaphor serves causality or character. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor slip: “bioluminescent recognition” slightly edges toward abstraction, but is immediately grounded by “bark humming... felt in her teeth.” No loops, no scaffold, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “glass walls refracting darkness instead of light” conveys world logic, atmosphere, and paradox in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—light as fabric, song as wind—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “tone of bound release that wrapped around the space like wind through wheat” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“She approached…”, “Elara began…”, “Through this ritual…”), and final line (“stepped into the release of their new morning”) recharges “bound release” motif with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“errors nested inside corrections” compresses backstory and philosophy). Figurative language is purposeful and consistent—“tidal emotions,” “nestled paradoxes”—without muddle. Sentence openings vary (“Elias had spent…”, “Through the walls…”, “A sound interrupted…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “nestled” motif, but no loops, scaffolding, or artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivory had swallowed the iron completely” conveys decay and agency in seven words. Figurative language is precise (“crust now hard as ceramic,” “softness of a ghost”) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary organically (“After the birds flew south...” / “Mara came here...” / “On the morning frost...”), and paragraph lengths shift with thematic cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. The final sentence—“teaching the city how to remember without breaking”—resonates because it’s earned by concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“glass rectangle containing not images but luminous vows”). Figurative language is coherent—light, frost, and sound motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor overwriting in “quartz hush of the frozen library above clouds” slightly slows opening, but momentum builds cleanly. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image (“blank slide like a prayer”) is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“lanterns swaying with the tide, voices hushed as prayer” establishes setting, mood, and constraint). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and pressure. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “sound of trust breaking crystalline and sharp” edges toward mixed metaphor (sound as solid object), though legible. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density high. Final third remains clear—artifact penalty avoided—but slight figurative muddle prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“purple crystalline hunger,” “bridal train of atmospheric disturbance”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting appears in the second paragraph (“terrestrially cosmic in its ancient marriage…”), but the pattern is taught early and pays off. Sentence openings vary, and the final cadence (“guide the weather-bearers home through the gathering storms of tomorrow”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language (“auroral sorrow,” “glittering tomb”) is pattern-taught and pays off. One paraphrase loop (“her creativity corked tight… talent reduced to a parlor trick”) slightly dulls momentum. Closure beat avoids artifacts—final image is clear, resonant, and propelled by strong verbs (“stepped through,” “itching to transcribe”).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ash swirl through the toxic sky,” “vines heavy with tomatoes brushed their shoulders.” Figurative language is purposeful—leaves “curling brown at the first whispered lie” avoids mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “shredded remains of what appeared to be a cartographer’s masterwork” (shredded implies remains), but no scaffold loops. Final line (“truth finally had a sanctuary where it could breathe and grow”) earns its lyricism through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent—wind “carries voices,” ice “glistens with colors that no longer existed”—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the middle (“maze of balanced rods… carefully weighted sails”) where description momentarily stalls propulsion. Final paragraph earns its lyricism: “truth remained, singing in metal and ice” crystallizes the story’s ethos without redundancy or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “petals displayed veins of strangely organic silver circuitry that pulsed with bio-luminescent rhythms” conveys setting, character priority, and hybrid biology in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during crisis (“igniting the eastern quadrant”), flowing in reflection (“nostalgia weighing down each joint”). Minor figurative density in peak beats (“thoughts into whirling snow,” “fire... translation”) is pattern-taught and pays off in closure’s “fragmented wholeness.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “strangely organic dark” echoes opening’s “strangely organic silver,” creating resonant propulsion without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (“jackhammer symphony,” “fragile as moth wings”). Figurative language is purposeful, though “sandstorm calm” borders on overuse. One paraphrase loop: “fractures that time and silence create” and later “heals not just individuals but the entire architecture of a place” slightly echo without deepening. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, landing cleanly on “some mysteries deserve their dawn”—a resonant, earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “tears now part of the seawater” merges emotion and setting). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spider motif) and payoff-earned (“spun a bridge”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “Her fingers…”, “This was…”). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “mathematical poetry of the original builders”—one ornamental phrase in an otherwise flawless line—but no artifact dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frozen lightning,” “vibration in the marrow,” “sedimented here.” Figurative language is coherent (salt as archive, gravity as breath). No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in mid-section (“crystalline cathedral”), but closure remains sharp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“liquid mercury,” “velvet shadow”) and pays off in closure. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “terrestrially cosmic” recurs as near-label, and “tranquil blaze” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but a slight density of metaphor in the middle third risks muddling causality—just enough to prevent 9+ despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“pipes gurgle their questions”). Figurative language is coherent: architecture as palimpsest, meteors as translators. Minor overwriting in “patiently nimble” repetition (three uses) slightly dulls uniqueness, but closure remains sharp. No loops or scaffolding; syntax varies naturally, especially in high-pressure beats like the final sealing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“flowers turning silver-white with the burden”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (velvet, radiance, resonance) and coheres physically (light refracting, bioluminescence drowning in slow motion). Minor overwriting in “tragically radiant display” risks purple prose, but it’s redeemed by immediate functional payoff (marking sacred transformation). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final line’s ocean metaphor ties back to the seashell without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “measuring her life by the slow drip of water through stone” does triple duty. Minor overwriting in “calibrated treason, exact and sharp as the thorn itself” slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (aurora, ink, stone). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes opening, but one redundant flourish prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“starlight filtered down in narrow columns, illuminating air thick with the dust of centuries” establishes light, space, time, and atmosphere). Figurative language is coherent—ocean memory, arteries of stone, frozen river of light—all serve acoustic/geological motif. Minor overwriting in “harmonic resonance of dark matter threading through void” risks abstraction, but closure remains clear. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “salt stains like tear tracks,” “voice like cracking ice,” “glass having flowed like water to cradle the toy.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “woven” motifs, but closure remains sharp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density (“grids within grids, patterns within patterns”) and strong verbs (“snagged,” “pulsed,” “vibrated”). Minor overwriting appears in “scintillatingly somber” (repeated twice)—a slight register strain—but it’s thematically justified. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line (“leaving the stones to whisper her absence”) earns its elegance through buildup, though the repetition of “scintillatingly somber” prevents a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shredded letters scattered beneath the compost bins” does setting, backstory, and discovery in one phrase. Figurative language is restrained and coherent (“storms circled like hungry wolves”). Minor scaffold in “her fingers stained with pulp and radiation burns”—slightly redundant—but no loops or template cadence. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic closure: short, declarative, forward-moving. No artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense but never muddled: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“his mushroom-beard trembling with each thunderclap” conveys fear, setting, and trait). Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm as symphony, shadows as origami) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “lyrically prophetic verses that spoke of a carpenter…” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line—“static that now sounded almost like laughter”—resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with near-zero scaffolding. Every sentence multitasks: “the wind off the Atlantic carried salt and ghosts” establishes setting, mood, and thematic tone. Figurative language is coherent (“stung like honey,” “auditory ghosts”) and peaks without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in the middle section, but rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors dawn’s emergence. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “breath crystallizing,” “iron teeth vibrating,” “azure coat flapping like a banner” each advance atmosphere, character, and plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching escalation. Minor overwriting in “unearthly and raw, a place where the physical world touched the spectral” slightly dilutes propulsion, but figurative language remains coherent. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closure beat is clean and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “sculpt patience from impatience,” “wolves dressed in meditation,” “rain and iron and patience” all do double duty. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the final paragraph (“wildness… stretch and settle”) risks purple prose, but it’s pattern-taught and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “squelching through mud that hadn’t seen moisture in eighteen months” establishes time, place, and stakes in one stroke. Minor redundancy in “empirical observation” phrasing (lines 4 and 15) slightly dulls momentum, but rhythm varies effectively—staccato for action, flowing for reflection. No mixed metaphors; every image (lantern pulse, train vibration) serves causality. Final line’s poetic lift feels earned, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “vibrant hush of the rain-soaked afternoon” does atmosphere, sound, and mood in five words. Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“brass and bile that had been calcifying throughout the evolution of the continent below”). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors—and register stays within Kip’s plausible lexicon even at peak stress. Sentence openings vary naturally, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and there are no paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “concentric circles of reverent absurdity,” which risks abstraction but is grounded by immediate context.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“cascade,” “migrated,” “threading”). However, minor overwriting appears: “digital fossils of human emotion that refused true deletion” borders on purple. One paraphrase loop: “abandoned voice notes that fell like digital snow” followed by “digital snow through the mainframe.” Final paragraph’s “singing in the silence between the notes of songs we no longer remember but can never forget” risks sentimental redundancy, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “paper boats on a dark stream” advances both character and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (shadows as serpents/smoke) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “sickly greens over the shifting polar sea” slightly dilutes urgency, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“map she had drawn from empathy into action”) recharges the core motif without redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph cuts serving emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bergs groaned against the pylons like old men shifting in their sleep” establishes rhythm and metaphor in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (ice as glass bells, endings as tending) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s cadence—crunching footsteps, singing ice—resolves the opening’s disorientation with earned musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“diesel sigh,” “skeletal gestures,” “carbon becoming sugar becoming spirit”—each line advancing atmosphere or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The amber pavilion...” / “Elena, the lone...” / “She withdrew...”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Overwriting appears in two high-pressure moments: “architecture of human intimacy” and “complex vintage of acceptance” verge on conceptual abstraction, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but these phrases flirt with label-speak, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“silver dust,” “mechanical heart,” “whisperfield calm”), and every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or ritual logic. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the scene’s cadence, and metaphors cohere within the established world (e.g., gears as memory). Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats—“faint luminescence,” “subterranean language”—but never obscures clarity or causality. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts mar the closure; information density remains high without sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is patterned (arcs, vines, spirals) without muddle, and sentence openings vary effectively. Minor redundancy appears in “vines climbed” repetitions (three mentions within 150 words), slightly dulling momentum in the middle third. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph achieves lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity. The phrase “pain was not forgotten, but transformed into the very shape of their continuing grace” risks near-thematic declaration but earns it through accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent—sound as rainwater, dust as commas—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “fractured sequences of memory and method” slightly dulls immediacy, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Final line (“trace the new grammars written in lichen”) delivers resonant propulsion without redundancy. One near-loop (“fractured sequences” appears twice) triggers −0.2, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with high information density: “chalk dust coating his knuckles like bone meal” conveys texture, symbolism, and character in one image. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“acoustic shadow of entropy accelerating”) slightly muddles clarity, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line’s echo (“began again”) recharges the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density: “air thin enough to hear stars whispering against the glass dome” establishes setting, mood, and character in one breath. Figurative language is consistent (light as water, time as winding) and never muddled; metaphors serve causality (the dam of unrecorded light explains the shaking). Minor overwriting in the climax (“moments expanded like wings”) slightly dilutes urgency, but the final paragraph’s austerity—camera, leaf, serene observatory—recovers clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “the crackle before the song starts” does thematic, sensory, and rhythmic work simultaneously. Sentence openings vary (“Elena stood,” “Maya entered,” “Then it arrived”), and paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor overwriting risk—“static between stations” slightly echoes earlier “static” of guilt—but the metaphor holds. No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; momentum never stalls despite lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (“folded like parchment,” “shadows peeling like wet skin”) and never muddled. Minor scaffold appears in “she had spent weeks deciphering… she had to relearn…”—a slight paraphrase loop—but doesn’t dull closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the ritual, and the final line (“keeper of the key…”) recharges the opening motif with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “wax-and-ash effigy cracked her rationalism like a dropped porcelain doll” merges image, character, and theme. Figurative language is purposeful (thorns→gold at dawn = transformation) without muddle. Minor artifact: “shrewdly innocent” slightly borders label-speak but is immediately embodied in the girl’s pleading eyes. Sentence variety propels momentum—participles for urgency (“pushed through,” “stepped into”), fragments for emphasis (“There.”)—culminating in a resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “her breath synchronized with the circular patterns” merges action, emotion, and ritual). Minor overwriting in one beat—“dim cathedral of stone and vapor where sound dissolved into the hush of dripping water”—edges toward purple but pays off thematically. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language is coherent (light as water, grotto as snake). Final paragraph’s “gentle and permanent as the tide” lands with earned resonance, not cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful (“servers stood like monoliths,” “digital ghost”) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse.

No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spun golden stories, threads of light and sound weaving together the history of the harvest” does triple duty (action, theme, image). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“bargains made between seed and soil, promises kept and broken”) slightly dilutes momentum. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Final line (“growing things stretching toward the light”) resolves with resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and largely precise, with high information density—e.g., “fossilized fruit” implies time, decay, and sterility in two words. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “crystalline plumes that hung suspended in the air as if the atmosphere itself had forgotten how to exhale” slightly overextends the metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of elevated diction (“geological phenomenon”) borders on register drift. Final image remains clear despite figurative richness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose maintains high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, and plot—with zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (light “skitters,” echoes “pool”) and never muddles peak beats. Sentence openings vary naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the single-line “He wound the mainspring…”). Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in descriptive passages, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is masterful: high information density (“dust motes that swirled in golden spirals, each one a tiny galaxy of dead skin and mineral memory”), varied sentence openings, and rhythmic propulsion that breathes with the ritual’s phases. Figurative language is coherent—fractals, calcification, whalebone—all reinforcing the core metaphor without muddle. Minor overwriting in “residual warmth from the day's sun and vibrating with ancient harmonics” slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops, scaffold sentences, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s “exhaled a breath it had held since autumn” perfectly modulates closure with lyrical restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line yield: “each raindrop acted as a lens, crystallizing time into suspended prisms” does atmospheric, thematic, and temporal work. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“tight grain near the center, the softer edges where decay had nearly claimed it”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror breath and boil. One paraphrase loop (“here and gone” repeated without added pressure) costs 0.4, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “boots sinking into vapor that swirled against gravity’s logic” establishes setting, physics, and character in one breath).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “maze of intentions etched into the architecture” does thematic, setting, and character work in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (navigation → growth metaphors) and payoff-earned (sextant measures sunlight, not stars). Minor overwriting in “mathematically precise” hollow silence slightly strains verisimilitude, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic closure—steady, precise, forward-moving—without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (e.g., “glacial hush descended, not merely silence but a palpable weight that crystallized the air between her ribs”).

No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Closure beat remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“oil-slick water carried the last violet light”) is coherent and purposeful, never muddled.

Final line recharges the “errant legend seeker” motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snow that fell without sound,” “rope coiled beside the man was not for catching fish,” “negative space where intention lived.” Figurative language is purposeful—fulgurite as “lens,” dock as “finger”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “infinitely patient” repetition (twice), but it’s character-defining, not filler. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line (“already searching for the next rope...”) echoes the opening without redundancy. No loops or artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“breath misting… premature elegy”; “blood return in vividly descriptive crimson rush”).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in the climax (“thunder wrapped in silk,” “calcium and dream”) risks density overload, though it’s mostly coherent. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; the final line’s “pollen in spring” ties back without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“migration of clouds,” “kelp-drift peace”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“desperate alchemy,” “cellular possibility”) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“clouds continued… while beneath them…”) perfectly mirrors thematic tension between indifference and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ghosts needed gravity,” “silence... pressed like deep water.” Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught (water = memory, light = truth).

No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final line (“whispered with possibility”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hydrogen petals drifted downward across the quiet sigh of falling petals” merges setting, rhythm, and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict.

No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line’s “thundering, perfect calm” perfectly echoes opening, closing the sonic motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“tidal obsidian ridge,” “microscopic grooves he had etched decades ago”). Figurative language is coherent: the pendulum as “iron teardrop” merges function and emotion without muddle. Minor overwriting in “searing reverie” slightly strains, but rhythm varies effectively (long descriptive sentences vs. clipped action beats). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “steady tick” echoes opening’s “swing of gears,” closing the cadence loop cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“cobalt silo rose against the stars like a sentinel forgotten by time”), but occasional overwriting risks clarity: “filament of intention left dangling like a half-formed thought” edges into abstraction. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent lines repeat “tenderly organized” conceptually. No fatal loops or artifacts, but the phrase “shape of intentions” appears three times with diminishing returns. Still, information density remains high, and closure image is unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with high information yield per line—each image serves character, theme, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively, though occasional overwriting appears (“differential equations tangled with poetry, quantum probabilities dancing beside agricultural forecasts”) where figurative density risks muddling causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one minor redundancy: “transformation” recurs without sufficient variation. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “ink that smelled of rain and regret,” “foghorn’s answer,” “manuscripts written on spider silk and longing.” Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. One minor slip: “thistled calm” in the final line borders on neologism, but it’s earned by context. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“each fragment reflecting a different year of her accumulating silence” conveys time, object, emotion). Figurative language is coherent—ash as memory, porcelain as anger—and never muddled. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“woven truth carefully through the holes… weaving truth carefully between…”) creates slight synonym churn, docking 0.1. Otherwise, rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are purposeful, and the final line resonates without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “concrete leviathan” conveys vault ruins economically; “brass teeth still sharp, still hungry” avoids purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative coherence—sedimentary layers, navigation metaphors—serves theme without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “organic chaos that kept humanity humble,” but closure image (“small sun in the underworld”) remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information density—e.g., “expectantly resigned reverence” conveys history, emotion, and stance in three words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the music. One paraphrase loop: “stripping away the discordant frequencies of resentment until only shared breath remained” and later “removing the aggressive tones… revealed a fundamental resonance” echo closely. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “portal to another understanding” slightly strains against the tactile logic of the rosette. No scaffold or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, though near-peak beats risk slight overwriting (“dendritic weight,” “stagnant time made visible and liquid”). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One minor loop: “synaptic plasticity” appears three times in close proximity, bordering on explanatory redundancy. Still, information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme—and the final image lands with crystalline clarity. No scaffold or paraphrase loops disrupt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“boots sticking to amber resin,” “wings still vibrating with trapped electricity”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the spiral ascent. Minor overwriting in “burnt honey” / “nectar dusk” risks slight redundancy, but the metaphors cohere under the story’s sensory logic. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“chairs inching toward windows, books migrating south”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (houses as sponges, silence as crystal). Sentence openings vary naturally, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line (“continuing their slow conversation with the tide”) recharges the opening’s seawall imagery. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“primordial stillness that had learned to want”) that borders on abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “calcified fingers trailing through anemones” conveys state, action, and metaphor simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent (geological/biological lexicon sustained throughout) and avoids overwriting—purple haze appears only when thematically charged. Minor deduction for slight density in mid-paragraph (“necrotic belief from healthy tissue” borders on abstract), but closure remains crystalline. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally with emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, varied, and purposeful. Sentence openings shift (“Elara climbed…”, “She had counted…”, “In her pocket…”), paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence, and every line advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent (dice as “white tooth,” staircase as “perpetual motion engine of stone and sorrow”) and peaks without muddle. One minor slip: “furious mathematical proofs” slightly abstracts, but immediately grounded by “theorems cascading like waterfalls of logic.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“glass walls fogged from the desperate breath of orchids” conveys setting, atmosphere, and thematic struggle). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “luminescent and trembling” slightly redundant after “glowing glyphs.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Figurative coherence holds—moonlight as transmission medium, smog as suffocation-turned-breath—but one mixed vehicle (“statistical silence of extinction”) edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hollow-boned Alouettes crafted delicate A-shapes that whistled low notes”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“rosewater dread,” “black rivers”) and payoff-earned. Minor flaw: slight overwriting in “phosphorescent moss that clung to the grotto ceiling”—“clung” feels redundant after “illuminate.” No loops, no scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final line lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (e.g., “brass mainspring counter clockwise” establishes method and motive). Figurative language is coherent—light “imprisoned,” shadows “consumed”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “bleak exhilaration of transgression flooding her chest” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“vanished into radiance”) avoids summary, landing closure in image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “phosphorescent mold” conveys visual, tactile, and thematic weight in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as residue, fear as parasite) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “morbid artistic precision” slightly dulls immediacy, but propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s cadence—short sentences (“The funhouse settled… She walked out…”)—mirrors unburdening, with zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Closure image (“empty enough to begin again”) crystallizes theme without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the xylophone mallet came down… in coronation”) and varied rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“fractal generating waves, each echo splitting into smaller copies…”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax repeat “fractal generating” with minimal pressure gain—a minor density slip. Figurative coherence holds; metaphors align within a sonic-physical logic. Closure image remains sharp despite lyrical saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density (“calcified backs of thirteen gargantuan turtles… fused into boulevards”). Figurative language is coherent—light “bakes,” shadows feel “temporary,” dread is “sunwashed”—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in the climax (“amber light,” “spiral architecture of the universe”) slightly dilutes clarity, but rhythm accelerates purposefully. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances theme, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (petals spiral, ivy filters sun) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “She had waited three years…” slightly slows opening, but quickly integrates into pressure. No loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“beacon guiding her through the gathering dusk”) resonates without overwriting—earned lyricism, not purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (architecture as leviathan, dreams as textile) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“each measurement a eulogy, each notation a prayer”)—a paraphrase loop that slightly dulls momentum—but it’s isolated and doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with action, and the final line (“ready to transcribe the silence where music once played”) resonates without redundancy. No scaffold, no AI-pattern artifacts, no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“mathematics texts spilled like fallen dominoes,” “silt clearing from disturbed water”) and avoids purple excess. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though occasional phrases verge on over-compression (“tranquilly perceptive awareness” risks label-speak). No loops or scaffolding; each line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. One minor slip: “dappled resolve manifesting in careful, deliberate motions” slightly abstracts action, but the tactile follow-through (climbing stairs, pressing stamp) redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose achieves high information density: “shadow pooling like spilled ink” establishes setting, tone, and inciting incident in seven words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (folding/unfolding motifs) and never muddles causality. Minor overwriting in “terrible, delicate beauty” slightly softens peak-beat clarity, but rhythm varies purposefully—paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels character, theme, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (geode as map/memorial, potential as groundwater) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting appears in “intangibly tangible” repetition, slightly muddying the motif, but never obscures causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with urgency. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—every line earns its place, though one near-redundant clause (“unfiltered awakening to the mathematics of loss” / “unfiltered awakening: understanding that death…”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “fingers trembled slightly” reveals emotion while handling key object). Figurative language is coherent—“sun bled amber” sets tone without muddle—and avoids overwriting in peak beats. Minor scaffold in “ancient gears grinding like distant thunder” borders cliché but is redeemed by context. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythmic breath without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “sieved hush,” “sky bruised into night,” and “tempered regret” do thematic, atmospheric, and emotional work simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One minor overwriting moment: “performing a sieved hush—a ritual of listening to what silence had filtered and preserved” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by immediate tactile grounding. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “coat snapping like a flag of truce,” “shackles rattling like dry leaves skittering across marble.” Figurative language is consistent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “fragile interim where words had been spoken but mercy remained ungranted” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts mar the closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shark scenting blood in still water” avoids cliché through specificity. Minor figurative density in mid-story (“wet sail,” “cracked lantern”) doesn’t obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold—each sentence advances character or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence (“broken but no longer lost… faith flickering yet warm enough to see by”) earns its lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “scar tissue mapping crimes she no longer recalled”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“delicately robust” applied to hands, baseball, legs) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in one beat (“dripped with condensation that tasted of copper and old prayers”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Closure image remains sharp: tears falling “for the capacity to finally recognize them as human.”

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density: “spices ground from seeds that grew only in the void between dying suns” conveys origin, rarity, and mythos in one phrase. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with emotional beats, and metaphors cohere (starlight hands, living frequency). Minor overwriting in the climax (“aromas… lodged directly in the soul”) edges toward abstraction, but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “breath forming crystals,” “guilt grew so heavy it lifted the penitent into the suffocating sky.” Figurative language is coherent (time as honey in comb, repentance as cloud-pressure) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “choking beauty” slightly dilutes the climax, but rhythm varies purposefully—long descriptive lines give way to terse action during unfastening. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“recycled cathedral of rust and regret,” “altar of grief”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match emotional beats. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“crystallized on the photographic paper in patterns that defied chemistry”)—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; final third remains clear and propulsive. One near-mixed metaphor (“needle” + “thread” + “piercing”) risks slight muddle but pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “volcanic twilight,” “mathematical precision,” “helical patterns matching the double-helix dance” risk figurative congestion in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold appears in “He had orchestrated coincidences for others—the wallet… the storm… the book…”—a summary list that could be dramatized. Yet rhythm varies effectively, sentence openings diversify, and information density remains high. The final paragraph’s cadence (“transforming everything into monuments to impermanence”) earns its weight through accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bruised purples,” “winking hush,” “geometrically inevitable” all multitask. Syntax varies effectively, and paragraph cuts serve pressure (e.g., descent down stairs). Minor overwriting in “calmly inventive grace” and “cradle of sparks” risks abstraction, but these are grounded by immediate tactile action. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “boots smeared with eel-slime that provided the only traction left in creation” establishes world, character, and stakes). Figurative language is coherent: “borrowed dawn,” “collapsed star dust,” and “frictionless waters” all reinforce the core physics-break premise. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each line multitasks (e.g., “masks slip away like wet emulsion sliding from overexposed paper” conveys theme, character history, and visual metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught (darkroom/storm/lightning as developing tray) and never muddled. Minor density in mid-text (“furiously tranquil resolve of the damned”) borders on register drift but is redeemed by immediate embodiment. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies purposefully to match emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence advances character, conflict, or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“whirred,” “parrying,” “murmured”) and specific nouns (“titanium ribs,” “crimson lacquer”). Minor overwriting in “fractured prism” and “structured invitation” risks abstraction, but payoff redeems it. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closure beat remains artifact-free. Read-aloud cadence supports thematic tension between order and chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme (“rusted metal shelves holding stories that the warden feared more than knives”). Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter clauses during tension (“They worked in silence”) and lyrical cadence in reflection. One paraphrase loop: “rebuilding what the regime had tried to destroy” and later “rebuilding the world, one page at a time” slightly echo without deepening. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “molting personalities” could risk biological dissonance if not for its consistent metaphorical use.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“The tidal arbor groaned as the tether cables strained”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound dissolving into mist, sky bruising purple) and paid off in closure (music as anchor). Minor overwriting in “mathematics and mourning turned melodic” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but no loops, scaffolds, or register drift mar key beats. Final line’s poise (“ready for whatever unplanned music might come next”) recharges the opening motif flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“clouds bruised the horizon,” “transparent bones”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match scene needs. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“bioluminescent code,” “mythological resonance”) but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“delicate balance of doubt and light”) recharges the opening ridge image without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“silence was full, heavy with everything Elias had not said”). Rhythm varies naturally—long, wave-like sentences break into staccato during revelations (“Cerulean,” she whispered). One minor flaw: “rhythmically placid” repeats as a refrain, bordering on scaffold (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; figurative language (ghost ship, silt, tidal memory) coheres physically. Final line’s “truth spoken across the water” risks slight abstraction but earns it through prior embodiment.
