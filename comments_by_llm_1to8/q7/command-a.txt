  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear: "patterns...patterns," "purpose...purpose," "drifting resonance...drifting resonance" recur without reweighting. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "her art...her resilience...her sense" stacks parallel stems. Stock phrasing weakens peak beats: "renewed determination," "mind racing with plans," "her breath visible in the crisp air." Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("Now, with her workshop...") front-loads context that could be woven into action. No outright causality breaks, but figurative language ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to mirror") hedges vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with vivid images ("frozen waterfalls," "ghost of sound") and varied sentence rhythm. However, several scaffold patterns reduce density: "Now, she was a translator of silence, seeking to rectify what had been lost" and "How could she rectify the absence of sound when even her own thoughts felt muffled?" loop the same concern. "Silently expressive" appears twice as a descriptor without added pressure. Opening paragraph front-loads backstory ("One moment... the next") in summary form, slowing entry. The dawn closure image is strong, but earlier beats carry minor filter-verb stacks ("her gaze drifted," "she focused on") and synonym churn ("muted," "impenetrable silence," "emptiness") that dull immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or tense breaks. Information density is moderate—beats advance but many sentences do single jobs. Minor loops: "rest to the restless" and "impossible spaces" recur without evolving meaning; "chased stillness" appears twice as a label. Template cadence in the opening (lean, press, lay, choke, warp) and closing (lifted, become, knew, realized) paragraphs. Filter verbs ("felt compelled," "felt both haunting and comforting," "felt a strange connection") stack in early paragraphs, dulling immediacy. No figurative muddle. Proofreading is clean. Deduct for loops and filter stacks (−0.6 in band) but the closure beat itself remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful paragraph breaks and varied sentence openings. Minor scaffold appears: "Word spread quickly, not of Mara's identity, but of the mysterious donor" uses a template corrective structure, and "the weight of her secret suddenly lighter" is a bodily cliché. The phrase "amplified quiet" recurs without evolving pressure. No dense loops, but information density is moderate—several beats restate the premise without advancing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and sensory images are concrete ("cool iron," "scent of wisteria giving way to...damp stone"). Figurative density is high throughout—"skeletal ribcage," "photograph overexposed to light," "sparks converging into a single beam"—yet remains legible and voice-motivated. Minor scaffolding appears: "Her motivation was clear" is tell-only exposition, and the phrase "a spark that refused to extinguish" in paragraph one is echoed by "the spark grew brighter" in paragraph three without added pressure. No major loops or template cadence, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The fragment pulsed faintly, as if alive" followed by "felt an inexplicable pull toward it, as though it held answers" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs through the climax: "She saw... She felt... It was both... When the light faded, Elara found herself..." (−0.5). The phrase "texture of time" recurs four times without evolving meaning, becoming a stock metaphor (−0.3). Filter verbs stack in the vortex sequence ("felt herself being pulled," "saw her ancestors," "felt the texture"), dulling immediacy at the story's peak (−0.5 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact penalty pack). Cumulative artifact penalties total approximately −1.5 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "The liberator's steps were deliberate, their movements patiently strategic" repeats the same idea; "Their chains rattled softly, a reminder of the burden they carried, but also of the strength it had forged" recycles one concept twice. Template cadence runs through multiple beats: "They [verb], their [noun]" structures proliferate. Stock metaphors ("shadows," "ghosts," "lifeline") and filter-verb stacks ("knew," "felt," "found") dull immediacy in high-pressure sequences. The closure beat's "as if they had never been there" is tellingly vague when specificity would anchor cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies adequately; opening and closing images anchor frame. Overwriting clusters in paragraph four: "vibrated, not with sound, but with emotion—the weight of trust, the sharpness of its fracture" stacks abstractions without concrete anchors (−0.5). Paraphrase loop in final paragraph: "the sound of trust breaking was not something to be feared, but understood" restates the premise without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language ("silence shaped like a scream") occasionally muddles vehicle. No grammatical errors; information density adequate outside the moralizing close.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the jar's essence was already working its magic" immediately follows "the jar cradled in her arms, its light spilling"; "luminous disbelief" appears twice in the final paragraph. Template cadence runs: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "Lira's [noun]." Stock metaphors ("press her ear against destiny's door," "veneer of ordinary life") appear in peak beats without transformation. Register drifts into elevated diction ("ephemeral," "ethereal") that clashes with thriller pacing. Sentence rhythm varies but information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "safe zones for inquiry, spaces where questions could be asked" restates the same idea. The phrase "thoughtfully spirited precision" and "weighty lightness" are oxymoronic constructions that obscure rather than clarify. Template stems recur ("She had," "Elara's"). Figurative density in the final paragraphs (thawing, cracks, light, growth) stacks without variation, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple template cadences and loops lower momentum: "trembling certainty" appears three times, "vulnerability" and "outwit" recur without reweighting, and phrases like "her phobias warring with her determination" restate rather than advance. Stock metaphors ("shadows deepening as if acknowledging her resolve") and filter stacks ("she felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy. The decrypt sequence is summarized ("Slowly, a pattern emerged") rather than shown with concrete notation. No single artifact obscures closure, but cumulative scaffold drag applies −0.6 in Q7; pervasive loops and unlanded figurative language ("whispers coalesced," "mirrors...shattering into light") add another −0.4, total −1.0 within the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative language is dense ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "sculpting silence") but some mixed metaphors muddle logic: hush is both "ambered" and "marbled" without clear differentiation, and "flaking gold leaf" is described repeatedly without advancing information. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs three and four both note the booklet glowing and the oracle's obsession. Template cadence runs: "The oracle's…" and "They…" open sequential sentences. Information density is low in the middle beats, with summary replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is generally high, weaving description with action. Minor scaffold appears in paragraph two ("as if it had been waiting for it" after "felt both alien and familiar") and paragraph five's paraphrase loop (iterations shown, then "realized that its thoughts were not just products…"). The climactic paragraph compresses effectively but "vast, interconnected web of existence" is generic elevated diction that clashes with the robot POV's prior specificity. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping deductions modest.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and no major loops or grammatical errors. However, thematic terms recur frequently without pressure accumulation: "ambiguously clear" appears three times, "resonant hush" twice, "whispered" four times, creating a decorative pattern rather than propulsion. The phrase "as if offering it as a bridge between them" and "symbols of the ambiguously clear truths" are abstract scaffolding that tell rather than show. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with good sentence variety and purposeful imagery (rainbows across foliage, glow mingling with fading light). Paraphrase loops appear in paragraph 3: "cracks not as flaws but as markers" immediately followed by "each stroke were a ritual" restates the same commemorative stance without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 5: "The garden seemed to respond, its blooms more vibrant, its air more alive" stacks parallel clauses mechanically. Filter-verb density ("seemed to," "felt a," "began to see") clusters in the final third without voice motivation, applying −0.5 per the artifact pack and disallowing 9+ globally. Deduction: −0.8 cumulative in Q7 for loops and template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "The nexus required calibration, and she knew the lever hidden beneath its casing was the key. She hesitated, her fingers brushing the cold metal, then activated the holographic interface" restates intent without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm glow") recur without fresh inflection. The opening and closing paragraphs mirror each other with "metallic," "twilight/deepened," "hum," and creature luminescence, creating a symmetric frame that deflates rather than charges the closure image. Template stems dominate: "She [verb], her [body part] [gerund]" appears in seven sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The flooded opera house was not just a ruin; it was a threshold, a liminal space where the past and present collided" restates the prior paragraph's "in between spaces" claim without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening: "She picked it up… and noticed… It was as if…" Figurative density is high but mixed: "hush of unstruck chords" is evocative, but "water damage creating images" as both literal and metaphoric device muddies clarity. The final two paragraphs summarize emotional resolution rather than dramatizing it, applying −0.6 for scaffold and loop, −0.3 for closure-beat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The truth she had swallowed was not a burden to be carried, but a seed to be nurtured" restates the wanderer's earlier framing without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the opening ("her eyes tracing," "her fingers hovered," "her mind peripherally aware") and final paragraph ("she understood," "she felt," "her auroral sorrow transforming"). Stock metaphors ("jagged shard," "swaying like the mountain winds," "roots… grow in the dark") recur without fresh vehicles. The smudge beat itself is clear, but scaffolding and synonym churn ("swaying certainties," "swaying without breaking") drag momentum at closure. Density is moderate; many lines serve theme rather than advancing situation or character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and no major grammatical errors. However, several phrases recycle stock images: "air hung heavy," "shadows that danced like spectral figures," "heart quickened," "breath caught." The opening paragraph stacks modifiers ("reckless abandoned-mill explorer") in ways that blur rather than sharpen. Paraphrase loops appear: "swallowed truth" is repeated without added pressure, and "weight" recurs as metaphor without evolving meaning. The final beat summarizes rather than showing the shift in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear but carries template cadence and stock phrasing: "breath catch," "distant call," "the only sound the faint echo of her own heartbeat." Paraphrase loops appear in the final paragraph ("the crumbling peace…no longer felt like a burden but a reminder"). Figurative language is dense without payoff—"drift of untold seasons," "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace" are repeated as ambient texture rather than charged at closure. No overt grammatical errors, but momentum sags under the weight of ornamental description in the catacombs journey.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her purpose felt different, softly adaptive" echoes the opening descriptor, and "ordinary magic" recurs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("spark of wonder," "seed taking root") reduce specificity. The curl's glow is asserted ("began to glow faintly") without sensory grounding or causal mechanism. Template stems appear in Elara's final reflection ("It wasn't me... It was the moment. And you"), which reads as scaffolding rather than character-particular speech. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.3, stock metaphors −0.4, template cadence in dialogue −0.3; total −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and loops reduce density. "Sensitively perceptive" appears three times in identical phrasing; "displaced axis" recurs without reweighting. Paraphrase loops: paragraph one's "stories walls have heard" is restated in paragraph two and again in the final line without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph six: "She closed her eyes, her mind probing… her heart beating…" stacks filter constructions. Mixed metaphor: "bronze quiet" (tactile/auditory) collides with "walls have heard" (metaphor) without payoff. Figurative density in the climax ("golden light," "hum with life," "vibrant symphony") asserts rather than dramatizes the change. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in the peak beat; total −1.1 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    Loops and paraphrase cycles pervade the text: "cryptic...enigmatic...mysterious" recur without functional variation; "open secrets" and "hidden messages" are restated across adjacent lines; "orchestrate...directing...conducting" form a synonym chain within one paragraph. Template cadence appears in the final third ("The mysterious lighthouse...was now..."; "And as Li Wei set out..."). Figurative language stacks without coherent vehicles ("beacon cutting through fog," "threshold to a new reality," "symphony of self-discovery") and mixed metaphors appear ("transpose life into a new key" + "harmonize...into a symphony"). Sentence openings are mechanically varied with subordinate clauses but lack rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.6)
    Heavy text-artifact load: paraphrase loops ("silence wasn't empty but resonant," "silence now carried weight, a deliberate pause"), template cadence ("The priest…," "The anchor…," "The possession…" across consecutive sentences), and stock metaphor strings ("threads," "void," "fabric of existence"). Mixed metaphors: the palette's "black color" is simultaneously "absence, potential, the space" and something that can be "painted…in the air itself" without coherent physical logic. Register is uniformly abstract-philosophical with no modulation. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("plumb," "unraveling," "peeled back") across peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a little less afraid of its own questions"). Apply −1.7 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "seemed to hum," "seemed to echo," "seemed to pulse" across three beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("threads of silk," "cascade of sound") and therapy-speak ("chronologically homesick") clutter peak moments. Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate the same mood without advancing pressure ("The horizon is a mirror" written, then narrated again). Clarity is adequate, but propulsion stalls in decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops recur: "The tablet's runes flickered, urging her to move on" immediately follows a paragraph about the tablet guiding her, and the final paragraph's "The drop had fallen, and the ripple was hers to shape" restates the opening's suspended-between-drop-and-ripple metaphor without reweighting it. Template cadence dominates: "She saw X, she saw Y, and she saw Z" structures repeat across the convergence beat. Prompt vocabulary ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") lands as undigested labels rather than purposeful diction. The closing smile and breath are gestural clichés that deflate the resolution. Figurative language is strained: "darkness and brightness merge" mixes light metaphors without concrete embodiment, and the "ribbon of light" opening is a stock image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm generally supports scene needs. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "silence not of her choosing but of her own making" and "emotional numbness had become her constant companion" restate the same concept; "the songs, once familiar, now sounded alien" is immediately echoed by "their melodies distorted yet hauntingly beautiful." The closing beats stack abstract noun phrases ("a space where all possibilities resided, a place where she could finally be whole") that summarize rather than propel. Figurative density in non-peak passages (e.g., "filament of hush, a whisper of possibility") adds texture but occasionally slows momentum. Applying paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.2) and template-cadence issues (−0.4) totaling −0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean. The opening paragraph balances action and atmosphere, but several beats rely on stock constructions: "heart raced," "resolve hardening," "felt lighter…purpose fulfilled." The phrase "credibly curious nature sparking a flicker of intrigue" loops concept and effect within one line. Figurative language ("shadows themselves were watching," "whisper from a world") appears in multiple high-pressure sentences without pattern payoff. No major loops or scaffold, but information density is moderate; many lines advance plot without doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and vivid imagery ("the rope slipped…uncoiling like a serpent"). However, several lines loop conceptually: "the texture of time" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure, and "patterns seemed to shift/pulse" appears in three separate beats. The final paragraph's "a poem to write—and rewrite, endlessly" feels like thematic summary rather than propulsive closure. Minor scaffold ("his heart pounding with a mix of fear and excitement") and a paraphrase loop in paragraph three ("freedom to wander, to write, to question…freedom also meant solitude") reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence rhythm and vivid images ("charred remnants," "fractured glass"). However, synonym loops appear ("hush" / "silence" / "stillness" cycle across adjacent paragraphs) and stock metaphors ("canvas to be filled," "brush") lower density. Paraphrase near the end ("the hush had never been her enemy; it had been her muse" restates the prior realization) and template cadence in paragraph two ("It was here... that Elara... found herself drawn") dull momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting the deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. The prose favors abstract nouns and weak constructions ("was near," "felt a shift," "seemed softer") over strong verbs and concrete action, especially in the transformation beat. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs four and five restate the petal's essence and Elara's process without adding pressure. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("She tucked... and turned... She hoped... she knew...") flattens momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for loops and template stems in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and moves efficiently; no loops, scaffold, or pronoun drift. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm creates visual flow. Minor scaffold appears: "Tonight, though" recurs as a transition stem; "the locket photo in her pocket" is repeated across beats without tactical variation. Information density is moderate—lines advance story without padding, but figurative language is sparse and generic ("echo lingering," "breeze carried the scent"). The final paragraph over-explains fulfillment ("its purpose had been fulfilled") where image alone would suffice. No Text-Artifact penalties warrant −0.3 or more; overall clarity and propulsion hold.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and free of major grammatical errors. However, template cadence appears in several stretches: "Her motivation was clear," "Her sculptures, her search, her boldly sympathetic heart—they had all been threads," and repeated "she [verb]" constructions. Stock metaphors—"web of kinship," "thread by thread," "luminescent ache"—recur without fresh inflection. The final paragraph stacks abstract summary ("they had all been threads") where a concrete image would deliver higher density. No loops or scaffolding obscure causality, but figurative density in reflective beats (metaphors in most sentences of the second and third paragraphs) flattens momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening: "moment of stillness" / "interrupted cadence" / "slipping through her fingers" all restate flatness without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the canal sequence: "The pull grew stronger…Without thinking, she stepped…The water below churned…She had always been drawn." Stock metaphors pervade: "towers leaned closer," "time blurred," "wave of understanding washed over her." Figurative density in high-pressure beats (descent, pool) obscures concrete action. The final paragraph's "symphony" and "eternal song" are generic rather than textural.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful momentum through the investigation sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her mind racing with possibilities" / "her thoughts dovetailed into a theory" restate mental engagement without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the decoding sequence ("She sketched... then compared... To her astonishment"). The phrase "dovetail" recurs as both thought process and literal action, muddying its specificity. Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "calling to her") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is maintained and grammar is clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce propulsion. "Their motivation was clear" / "Their motivation burned brighter" / "their motivation had been right" recycles the same stem. "They thought of… they thought of…" and "Each fragment revealed… a snippet… a fragment…" are synonym churn. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "metallic veins," "thread woven through time") appears densely without pattern-teaching or closure payoff, trending toward purple without muddle. The final paragraph stacks summary sentences that restate fulfillment rather than advancing image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with strong sensory detail and varied sentence rhythm. "The nursery was her sanctuary, but it was also her cage" balances clarity with thematic weight. Minor loop: "The leaf wasn't just a leaf; it was a catalyst, a symbol" restates in adjacent beats. The phrase "circuitously sincere" appears twice without functional variation (once narratively, once as Mara's self-description), adding slight redundancy. No major artifacts touch the closure, but the final paragraph summarizes emotional progression rather than trusting image, reducing density.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images (crumbling cottage / golden sunset painting). However, paraphrase loops appear: "her insomniac mind a canvas of unending restlessness" and "her unyielding search for clarity" restate the same concept; "her mind buzzing with questions" and "a riddle she couldn't yet solve" similarly loop. Template cadence in "She slipped it into her pocket... She returned to her cottage... she had pieced together" creates syntactic monotony. Figurative density in the opening ("tapestry of parched lands," "ancient sentinels," "thresh meaning from chaos") front-loads metaphor without payoff in the closure beat, and "haggard awe" in the final line repeats the opening's framing language without clear reweighting, reading as prompt echo rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The unseen forces had guided her…even when she didn't see it coming" recycles the opening hook; "not despite her unpredictability, but because of it" is an empty toggle. Stock mystical phrases ("consciousness merging," "bridge the gap," "bright darkness that illuminated without blinding") cluster in the transformation sequence. Paragraph cuts would remove scaffolding without altering knowledge or stakes. Rhythm is monotonous; sentence openings repeat clause structures across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase adjacent content: "the harbor remained a ghost of its former self, a testament to navigated absences" closely echoes the prior clause, and "absences she navigated were no longer voids but spaces waiting to be filled" restates the thematic claim without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "breath catching") appear in peak beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice well, yet mid-passage scaffolding ("her task was to compile fragments into meaning") externalizes the premise rather than advancing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("mist curling around her ankles like a living thing"), but several paraphrase loops appear: "something was about to change" / "something within her had shifted" and repeated "trembling certainty" across beats. The final paragraph stacks abstract declarations ("she no longer feared," "she embraced them," "her journey had only just begun") that summarize rather than propel. Stock metaphors ("fortress of unspoken truths," "labyrinth of corridors") and filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "felt a void, a longing" restated across paragraphs, "felt drawn"/"felt an urge"/"felt an inexplicable pull" cycle without added detail. Template cadence runs through exposition blocks ("It was a small…," "It was as if…," "It was not just…"). Stock metaphors ("canvas of stars," "shower of starlight") and therapy-speak ("courageously kind hands") appear in peak beats without embodiment. The final third stacks these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentences advance efficiently; no major loops or scaffold. However, several lines display figurative density without payoff: "shadows danced like ancient whispers," "each moment blending into the next like watercolors on wet paper," "drawing his gaze like a moth to flame" cluster stock metaphors in early beats. Template cadence appears in the climax: "The air crackled...the whispers...grew louder...He was on the brink..." stacks parallel constructions. Deduct −0.6 for figurative muddle and template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and grammatically clean. However, paraphrase loops appear ("She didn't understand it fully, but she knew it meant leaving everything behind—again" closely echoes prior content), and the ending paragraph recycles its own thesis across multiple sentences ("fair trade," "balance, honesty, and the courage"). Stock metaphor ("door cracking open in a room she'd been locked in for years") and template cadence in interiority ("She stared," "She reached," "Clara felt") reduce density. Figurative language in the ink-pot beats (rippling, pulsing, glowing) stacks without clear escalation. Line-level momentum sags in the final third under explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean with no major loops or artifacts. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to amplify," "felt different," "knew this story was special"), dulling immediacy (−0.5). Sentence openings repeat stems: "Elara's method," "Elara's heart," "Elara smiled." Information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing situation. The climactic paragraph ("story that unfolded") summarizes instead of dramatizing the discovery, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent lines: "They were a death certificate error survivor... their existence a glitch in the system. This nameless wanderer filtered reality differently..." (scaffold restating identity); "Each fragment was a thread, woven into a tapestry... Each object was a piece of someone's story" (synonym churn across paragraphs). Stock metaphor strings in peak beats ("a symphony of lives intertwined," "texture of memories") without fresh vehicle (−0.8 cumulative in Q7). Filter-verb stack in paragraph six: "they realized," "they understood" across two sentences. Pronoun "they" overused without sentence-level variation. Information density is low; many lines do one job only.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and controlled, but paraphrase loops and template cadence accumulate in the middle section: "as if she could summon," "as if she were standing," "as if he were both mourning." The final paragraph recycles "whisper of closing pages" from the timeframe element without reweighting it. Figurative language—"hues of a sunset trapped in glass," "bridge between the past and the present"—is functional but occasionally generic. Information density is moderate; some beats do double duty (cello hum triggering memory and physical response), but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "a swirling pattern of symbols, unlike anything she'd seen before" followed immediately by "a small, jagged stone… unmistakably significant" restates discovery without adding pressure (−0.2). The phrase "hopeful desperation" is used twice, once as abstract label and once as tonal claim in the final paragraph, constituting template cadence (−0.4). Stock metaphor "ignited the hearts" and "beacon of possibility" in the ending beats dull specificity (−0.3). Cumulative artifact debt totals −0.9, pulling the score from functional ~6.3 down to 5.4.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and legible, with varied sentence structure and no significant loops. However, several lines carry template cadence: "Her heart quickened," "A lump formed in her throat," "With a heavy heart" recur as emotional shorthand without embodied specificity. The phrase "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" are repeated for motif effect, acceptable here. Information density is moderate; some beats (adjusting helmet, ignoring communicator) add atmosphere but minimal pressure. Figurative language ("shadows danced," "universe whispered") is competent but familiar, not fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchors and purposeful cadence modulation (shorter clauses during the repair, longer breath at closure). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her blind eyes, clouded yet keen" immediately followed by "She relied not on sight but on…"; "every broken thing held the promise of renewal, every patch a chance to begin again." Elevated diction clusters in the final paragraph ("sanctuary," "soul within the machine") without sufficient POV grounding. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "an anchor of her own" as stillness contradicts an anchor's maritime function, though the thematic intent is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no causality-breaking loops. However, paraphrase cycles appear: "the pattern of condensation" is described twice in adjacent beats (window glass, then "the pattern again" at the lake center) without added pressure. Stock metaphors recur: "storm of thoughts," "her heart quickened," "tears welled in her eyes." Register drifts slightly elevated in peak beats ("singular convergence," "defying the frozen stillness") without stress-driven motivation. Template cadence surfaces in "She knelt... She stood... She walked" sequences. Density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "deliberate steps"/"measured"/"deliberate movements" recur across adjacent beats without adding pressure; "the town was awakening, step by step, note by note" restates what has been shown. Template cadence: "His X was Y" constructions repeat throughout. Stock metaphors ("heartbeat," "symphony," "ghosts") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "as if," "as though") dull immediacy in high-frequency passages. The closure paragraph over-explains rather than landing on image. Density is low; many sentences restate prior content. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across the piece; −0.3 additional for artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "unsnarl the secrets" appears three times with minimal variation; "lonesome splendor" recurs as a stock phrase without fresh context. Template cadence dominates the middle section ("She had to let go… to trust… to embrace"). Metaphors clash: the vial "emanates" glow, memories "flood," the temple "holds its breath"—mixed vehicles that obscure rather than sharpen. The prose summarizes key beats ("As she worked, the temple began to transform") instead of dramatizing them, and the final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("peace," "wonder," "beauty") without concrete image. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop check triggers cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.7)
    Clarity is adequate, but density is low: multiple sentences restate theme without advancing situation ("The lattice sustained impossibilities" recurs as ornament). Figurative language clusters without payoff ("thread the labyrinth," "chasing hush," "hovering in defiance" as metaphor). The final paragraph stacks summary and metaphor ("copperlight repose faded," "boy who chased truth") in place of propulsive action. Paraphrase loops appear in the journal-reading passage, restating the hush's cost across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraph two's "The bead was no ordinary trinket; it was a key" repeats the same claim in adjacent clauses; "soothed and tormented" / "lovingly venomous" recycle the contradiction without adding pressure. Template cadence ("Her presence was a whisper, a flicker...") and stacked modifiers ("mournful elation," "ephemeral cameo appearances") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("branches twisted like the arms of a mourner") and summary-only peaks (the climax is "grappled with conflicting emotions") flatten propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and scaffold, −0.3 for stock phrasing in peak beats; total −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "carve a path from ruin to reverence" appears three times, "hauntingly optimistic" twice, "orchid solace" three times, each without added detail. Template cadence runs through paragraphs two and three ("Each step was deliberate, each movement a stitch"; "not obstacles but inspirations, each one a thread"). Stock metaphor strings ("threads," "weaving," "tapestry," "stitch") lack fresh embodiment. Figurative density in high-pressure moments (final paragraph) blurs rather than sharpens the closure image. Accumulated artifacts warrant −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple prose artifacts harm momentum: paraphrase loops ("It was more than an object; it was a bridge" / "no longer just an object; it was a symbol"), template cadence in the opening paragraph (repeated "where" clauses), and therapy-speak labels ("cautious enchantment," "warmly curious") used without embodiment. Stock metaphors ("bridge between past and present," "beacon guiding") in the final paragraph dull the closure image. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Sentence openings vary minimally across paragraphs two through four.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Paraphrase loops appear: "carefully inventive methods" / "carefully inventive nature" and "discover meaning in the margins" / "uncover the stories hidden between the lines" restate without adding pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in exposition ("This was Lyra," "Her latest lead," "The arcade was") creates rhythmic monotony (−0.3). Figurative language ("painter wields a brush," "time capsule waiting to be opened") leans stock. Information density is modest; many sentences describe without advancing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks create visual pacing. Clarity is generally high; no major pronoun tangles or tense slips. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "the flame pulsed faintly, as if responding to her thoughts" is immediately followed by flame-based action without additional pressure; "her heart quickened" appears, then "unease in her chest" two lines later. The opening and closing both lean on abstractions ("unheard stories whispered by the cosmos," "vast... stories of the stars") rather than concrete image. The phrase "echoed silence" recurs as motif but risks oxymoron without payoff. Minor scaffold ("She paused... She rose... She sat back") and a few template cadences ("Her work was more than art; it was...") reduce density slightly but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("liquid silver," "ancient fingers") but several constructions loop: "Elara's [noun]" opens four sentences, and "the shard" repeats as subject across adjacent beats without variation. The final paragraph summarizes emotional resolution ("she felt whole," "she felt ready") instead of dramatizing it. Paraphrase appears in the opening: "The labyrinth was alive" followed immediately by "the mangrove's embrace." Propulsion is steady but information density drops in the second half where key beats (reading the letter) are told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery. However, several passages loop: "unknot" appears four times with similar constructions; "lotus-hearted ache" recurs identically; "shared anxieties" and "pulse/pulsed" repeat without adding pressure. The anesthetic mention ("necessary numbness") is scaffolding that never returns. Metaphor density in the middle third (coral glowing, mist swirling, air holding breath) stacks figurative language without clear payoff at closure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the transformation, triggering −0.4 for paraphrase loop and −0.3 for stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 cycles "gift/burden/unused" and paragraph 6 restates the epiphany across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 5 ("she set out," "she reached," "she carefully loaded," "she activated") stacks four identical subject-verb stems without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so apply −0.6 for loops and stems per Q7 penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (winking coin, polished obsidian eyes) is vivid and controlled. Clarity is high, and information density is good—most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "not ghosts but echoes" / "not painting but conducting" uses parallel negation twice in quick succession, and "transformed… exploding into life" then "stepped out… fully realized" restates the awakening across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("whirlwind of confusion," "cage") slightly weaken peak moments. No severe artifacts, but density could tighten by ~5%.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates across beats without algorithmic patterning. However, paraphrase loops appear ("The greenhouse was alive…" / "the greenhouse seemed to warp…"), and stock metaphors recur ("spark of defiance burning brighter," "encroaching darkness"). The seed description ("candidly cryptic") introduces elevated diction that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated. Clarity and grammar remain clean, but information density is moderate—several lines restate atmosphere without advancing action. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym chains appear: paragraphs 1 and 4 both assert the poet's motivation using near-identical phrasing; "the shell seemed to listen/hum/exhale" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence runs through the piece ("Her motivation was clear," "Her method was unconventional," "Her shyly unstoppable nature"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the essence of the shell," "the expanse of her imagination") that clashes with scene pressure. Accumulated line-level debt: −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is high; no grammar or pronoun errors. Rhythm is uniform and lacks sentence-level propulsion—most beats follow subject-verb-modifier structure without variation. Figurative density is high throughout ("crystalline tears," "tapestry of history," "shards of moonlight") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" / "voices of those whose names had been erased" / "forgotten names." The ending repeats "deserted marvels" and "gently systematic" without added cost. Information density is low; many lines redescribe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "to restore trust" recurs across paragraphs, and "symphony of truth" / "symphonies of truth" / "the symphony of truth" cycles without added pressure. Figurative language ("whirlwind of cautious exuberance," "tapestry of truth") stacks in exposition without dramatized cost. Opening and closing lines are competent but lack propulsion; the final beat ("And as the symphony of truth echoed around them, they were") feels tagged on rather than inevitable. Minor scaffold detected but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence runs dominate: "His hands trembled… his resolve dappled… his words as precise… his achievement" chains possessive openings without variation. Paraphrase loops appear ("the tension between them had grown as palpable" / "urging him forward" / "seemed to close in" / "seemed less foreboding")—the amphitheater's anthropomorphism is restated without added pressure. Stock metaphors abound: "his mind worked like the gears," "chain trailing behind him like a lifeline," "dots, both literal and metaphorical." Figurative density in peak beats (paragraphs 2–4) obscures momentum. Pronoun references and tense remain clean, and spatial choreography tracks, preventing further collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stock metaphors proliferate without fresh inflection: "paper trail of half-truths," "blooming and withering parts of her soul," "void," "symphony." Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "preserve the echo of lost songs" / "songs she had thought lost forever" / "songs she had found" / "echo of lost songs." Template cadence runs: "She [verb], her [noun]" structures repeat across multiple beats. The final paragraph front-loads figurative language ("symphony of blooming and withering, of loss and rediscovery") that obscures rather than sharpens the closure image. Sentence openings vary minimally; paragraph rhythm is uniform. Information density is low—many lines restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax and clear action sequencing. Information density is uneven: early sentences do multiple jobs ("She was the corn maze architect's lost child, though she had long since stopped searching for him"), but the ending paragraph loops conceptually ("sacred thresholds," "distances," "closure") without advancing image or pressure. Paraphrase appears in the final two paragraphs ("understood now" / "found what she was searching for"), dulling propulsion. Figurative language is heavy throughout ("featherly," "fractured hush," "butterfly effect") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence concerns in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with vivid images ("breath fogging the surface," "golden glow through the cracks"). However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "softly ingenious glow," "shadowseam wonder," and "luminous respite" appear multiple times as stock phrases that elevate register without adding information. The phrase "her hand moving with a softly ingenious precision" in paragraph three stacks modifiers without concrete gain. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs two and four both describe fireflies pulsing and Elara syncing her breath/heartbeat without advancing new pressure. Template cadence: "She pulled out," "She sketched," "She realized," "She gathered," "She stepped"—stems repeat across sequential beats. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and, touching the closure paragraph, disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled without overwriting. Clarity is good; no major loops or scaffold. Minor issues: "transliterates emotions into tangible forms" is immediately followed by "to give shape to feelings," a paraphrase loop. "Her motivation was not just professional but deeply personal" tells what the prior sentence already showed. The closure beat—"she felt a sense of peace, understanding that the missing pieces were not flaws but part of the tapestry"—leans into summary and abstraction rather than concrete image. Sentence openings and paragraph structure vary purposefully. Information density is moderate; some lines could do more than one job.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "He moved the bishop...The child's balloon drifted left; the bishop moved left. The couple turned a corner; the bishop turned" is mechanical parallel structure without variation. Synonym churn around "serendipity," "randomness," and "calculated wilderness" recurs without added pressure. The final three paragraphs repeat the core premise in adjacent sentences ("his act complete, but his work far from over" / "ready to happen again, to order randomness"). Stock metaphors ("symphony waiting to be conducted," "threads in a tapestry") appear without fresh specificity. Artifact concentration in the final third disallows 9+ and caps high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.7)
    Density is high, but overwriting pervades: "spontaneously anchored," "cosmic verse on mortal skin," "miniature galaxy suspended in glass," and similar constructions stack figurative language without clear escalation. The phrase "a dance not of water but of starlight" and "her verse a shield and a sword" mix metaphors without grounding. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knew... Yet the urge... Her method... It was..." Paraphrase loops: "obsidian grace" recurs as both setting description and character attribute without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally maintained, but several passages loop semantically: "patterns where others saw chaos, and in those patterns, he found meaning" restates the same idea; "not as it was, but as it could be… not as they appeared, but as they truly were… not as a glazier, but as a keeper of light" forms a three-part parallel that paraphrases rather than advances. Stock phrases ("weathered hands," "soft glow," "pale light") appear in the opening. The final paragraph summary ("his own clarity, his own noctilucent reckoning") re-labels rather than dramatizes. Information density is moderate; key beats lack propulsion because they describe rather than enact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("the moon hung low, bathing the ridge in a soft silver glow"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "broken things, the pieces others left behind" adjacent to "fractures within him, the parts of his soul"; "thought of the night the fire had taken his crew" followed immediately by "thought of the villagers." Template cadence runs in the reflection sequence. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed ("hard softness," "cracks seemed to glow...a hard softness").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully with paragraph structure and sentence length supporting the meditative tone. However, abstract phrasing pervades peak beats: "serene upheaval," "trial balloons," "equations for hope," "patterns...were her compass." The opening and closing paragraphs recycle "serene upheaval" and "trial balloon" without reweighting them. Several lines loop conceptually: "the act of creating itself" appears twice in adjacent beats. Figurative language is frequent but some metaphors strain clarity ("time seemed to fold in on itself," "patterns...were her compass"). No single artifact obscures causality, but the cumulative effect dulls immediacy in the final third, triggering deductions for density and loop without reaching the artifact-pervade threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun drift or tense breaks. Minor paraphrase loop: "she thought she glimpsed something—a flicker of light, a shadow of movement. But when she blinked, it was gone" offers image without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("twisted like a serpent," "fingers," "pulse") appear in succession without fresh inflection. The final paragraph's transformation ("the burden remained, it no longer felt heavy. It felt like purpose") uses tell-efficient summary rather than embodied change, flattening the closure beat's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings differ. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Her motivation was singular: to persuade mirrors..." followed by "This was no ordinary task, for mirrors were stubborn things" restates the challenge without advancing it; "She had succeeded, but at a cost—her own heartbeat now fainter, borrowed and shared too many times" summarizes rather than dramatizes the price. Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" constructions in the climax paragraph. Stock phrases ("held its breath," "shimmered like a dream," "crowned with flowers") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-specific texture. Information density is uneven: the opening paragraph front-loads context, while the resolution paragraph tells outcomes rather than charging them with image. Propulsion slows in the final third as summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong imagery (ebony clipboard, flickering fires). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "operatively gentle" appears three times, "slow dance of celestial bodies" twice, "flawed beauty" twice without reweighting. The phrase "ritual significance" is told rather than shown through action. Some template cadence in the climax: "She spoke not as...but as..." and stacked abstract nouns ("weight," "scars," "symbol") in the opening reduce density. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags under decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "more than an object; it was a symbol" restates itself, and "the echo of extinct birds" recurs without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She had acquired...She was secretly...Her public persona"). Figurative language clusters in the opening and closing without pattern-teaching: "cracked mirror," "billowed," "fractured grace" stack without clear payoff. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("echo of extinct birds would return") rather than letting the rain image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence openings recycle stock patterns: "She approached," "She closed her eyes," "She raised her hands," "She stepped back," "She knew." Figurative language clusters without payoff: "bodily poetic grace," "verse in an unspoken poem," "stillness as eloquent as her dance," "between sigh and smile," all within the opening two paragraphs. Register drift into abstract diction ("paradox," "reckoning," "conduit," "symphony") undermines momentum in the central beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "voices of those who had dared to resist" / "a chorus of voices, each one a testament"; "sealing by threads" / "strands of memory, woven from the lives of those who had come before." Cumulatively, these artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally).

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with "Elias" or "As he," creating mild template cadence. Phrases like "half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush," and "uncommonly serene" are repeated without accumulating new meaning. The puppet-arranging montage ("Hours passed as he worked") tells rather than showing key content. Figurative language is frequent but not overwrought; no loops or major artifacts touch closure. Apply −0.3 for template stems and −0.2 for repeated prompts without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm is controlled and lyric, with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Clarity is high; no causality obscured. Minor loop: "transiently rooted" and "blushing stillness" recur as labels without added pressure. Stock metaphors: "fragment of a forgotten dream," "holding its breath." Figurative density is high (moth wing as symbol, spiral as signal, hum as bridge) but mostly coherent. Information density is moderate—several sentences restate Elara's philosophy without advancing the scene. No major artifacts touch closure, but the prose leans toward thesaurus-inflected lyricism ("verdant," "esoteric," "iridescent") that occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    Runs of similar sentence structures dominate: "The sanctum was…," "Elara's latest project was…," "The method she chose was…," "The timeframe…was not arbitrary." Template cadence and synonym loops ("refuge…place," "precise and tender," "silence…music") appear frequently without pattern-teaching. "Snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" are stock metaphors. Figurative density in the aurora descriptions (pulsing, dancing, cheering) stacks without clear progression. Several paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs reduce information density.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "precisely playful" recurs without function; "the wafer seal" is named and re-described across multiple lines without new pressure. Template cadence: "As the storm approached… As the wind howled… As the hours passed… As the storm reached its peak" creates drumbeat monotony. Stock metaphors ("vines curled like serpents," "heartbeat that drove Foresight forward") and elevated diction ("abiding," "essence of reality itself") muddle the final beats. Clarity survives but momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and templated phrasing: "frugal" appears four times, "empirically ironic" twice, "dusky harmony" thrice, "encrypted devotion" four times, "seal a covenant" four times—mostly as label assertions rather than varied texture. Runs of "His/He [verb]" stems across paragraphs 2–4 create template cadence. Stock metaphors ("bridge to the future," "guardian of ancient knowledge") and thesis-speak ("enduring bond between humanity and cosmos") dull momentum. Mixed register (astronomer's empirical POV vs. cosmic mysticism) is unanchored. Artifacts pervade closure paragraph, triggering −1.7 baseline in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is serviceable, but several beats loop conceptually: the music box's broken pin is explained three times ("rendering it useless," "damaged cylinder pin," "broken pin a symbol"). Template cadence appears in Elara's tactics—"She found it," "She guided him there," "She held out the music box again"—creating a mechanized rhythm in the persuasion sequence. The phrase "scheming pacifist" and "scheming mind" recur without fresh angle, and "shifting grace" is repeated verbatim across paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative language is sparse, avoiding overwriting, but information density is diluted by paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.7)
    Patterned cadence appears in repeated "seemed" constructions and template sentence stems: "The air was heavy," "The challenge was clear," "The tone of her work shifted." Metaphor muddle: "glass mountains" as tone descriptor is abstract and contradicts physical logic (mountains are not delicate). "Time blurred in the ruined orchard district" tells temporal compression rather than showing perceptual degradation. Paraphrase loop: "boundaries dissolved like mist" (paragraph 1) echoes "boundaries...not solid...like the fog" (paragraph 6) without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks three summary sentences that could be cut without knowledge loss, lowering information density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally strong, but several paraphrase loops appear: "The mender's name was Elara, and she was endearingly feisty" → "earning her both admiration and exasperation" restates the same trait without added pressure; "a reminder of promises made and broken" → "a talisman of hope and regret" cycles synonyms. Template cadence runs appear in the middle section: "She used... She thought... She sat..." across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative language is dense ("chaotic beauty," "blanket," "glimmered") without always advancing the beat. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty, but scaffolding phrases ("Now, she sought to persist") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops are evident: "The orchard was no ordinary garden" restates what the opening line already shows; "pursue forbidden knowledge, the kind that whispered" adds synonym churn. Template cadence clusters in the middle ("She paused... she felt... she realized... she murmured"). "Simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet" are forced coinages that read as prompt artifacts rather than voice-motivated compression. Figurative density is high but not always coherent—"blossoming trees and whispering silence" is pleasant but generic. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("mysteries," "destiny," "secrets") without propulsion. Minor −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for register drift into thesis language.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops: "the library's whispers" / "unheard symphony" / "symphony of secrets" recur without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "She paused… She knew… She spent… She approached… She felt…" runs through the middle third. "The mountain whispered its approval" is a mixed metaphor (mountains don't sigh and whisper approval simultaneously). Stock phrasing: "her mind already racing," "the weight of her discovery." Filter-verb stack in paragraph six ("felt," "knew," "carried") dulls immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and fluid, with varied sentence structure and sensory detail woven through action. However, the piece carries multiple line-level artifacts: near-paraphrase loops ("the card was more than a mere object; it was a key" / "to find the garden… a place rumored to exist"), decorative synonym churn ("memories altered" / "memories shifting"), and template cadence in reflective beats. The final paragraph summary ("The ship, the card, the memories—they had all been steps") externalizes the theme rather than trusting the image. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally mixed ("blooming names" works; "trapped freedom" as both concept and tone feels forced).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The seal's design was a labyrinth, each curve and line a clue" is immediately restated as "She knew the key lay not in the seal alone but in its connection." Template cadence runs appear ("Elara's task was…," "Elara's approach was…," "Elara's method was…," "Elara's hands moved…"). Stock metaphors ("heart of the university," "tapestry of connections," "beacon of clarity") and therapy-speak ("adaptability," "emotional honesty") dull peak beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt like") stack in high-pressure lines. The final paragraph summarizes the entire thematic claim rather than trusting the image, violating the show-through-concrete-action principle and triggering penalties for thematic echo and summary.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe visually, but information density is low: many lines restate mood or setting without advancing situation or choice. "The air was thick with tension, the caves themselves seeming to hold their breath" and "The tone of the caves had shifted, the hammered repose of their song now laced with anticipation" are paraphrase loops that recycle atmosphere. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "seemed to whisper") stack in final beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "gently luminous" recurs four times, and "echo chamber stone" appears in formulaic constructions. No major artifact obscures causality, but scaffold and synonym churn prevent the prose from achieving propulsion in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence structure varies adequately and grammar is clean, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "She had dedicated her life to preserving the pavilion, a relic of an era" is immediately echoed by "a time long past" and "centuries of dust and neglect," creating synonym churn. Stock metaphors appear ("her heart raced," "wave of warmth") without fresh embodiment. The prism's reformation is vivid but leans toward overwriting ("its colors shimmering with a life of their own," "melody, a song of the stars") with figurative density that does not teach a pattern or tighten pressure. Template cadence is visible in the parade of "She [verb]" openers across the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid sensory anchors and no major grammatical errors. However, several patterns reduce propulsion: the opening paragraph front-loads exposition ("Her name was Elara, a summer-quill archivist tasked with…Her motivation was clear…She was preemptively nostalgic"), and the final paragraph loops back to thematic keywords without advancing pressure. Stock constructions appear: "her brow furrowed in concentration," "her heart quickened," "closed her eyes, letting the visions wash over her." The metaphor "shadow lengths...revealing hidden truths" and "fog wall" are functional but border on symbolic convenience. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are severe enough to trigger heavy penalties, but the cumulative effect is moderate density loss in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in key beats: "her heart ached, but her resolve deepened" / "her resolve deepened"; "as it was, but as it could be" / "a place of light, life, and possibility" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs: "Lira's motivation was clear… Lira's heart ached… Lira's next step… Lira stepped back… Lira smiled." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 3: "Lira's heart ached… she knew her task… she began to see." Stock metaphors: "thread through fabric," "floodgate opening after years of drought." These artifacts dull momentum and lower information density without breaking clarity, triggering baseline deductions in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates with scene needs. Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto…was the perfect setting" followed by "The grotto…was no longer just a setting" repeats the anchor without advancing pressure. Metaphor density is high ("tapestry," "thread," "strata," "metamorphosis," "shell") and occasionally stacks without clear escalation. Figurative language in the final third ("synchronized with her heartbeat," "multidimensional maps") reads decorative rather than propulsive. No major scaffold or template cadence, but synonym churn ("warmly observant," "tangential approach") recurs as labels. Minor deduction for density without earned escalation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and sentence openings are mostly diverse. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "her chest tightening" / "her heart pounding" recur without new pressure. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("pure," "hug," "melting away," "set her free") that dilute concrete imagery. "Tone stretching contracted" (paragraph 4) reads as opaque phrase-craft without clear referent, applying a −0.3 penalty for register drift at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with varied sentence structure and purposeful pacing. However, several phrases lean toward overwriting: "vaulting hush of the drifting prism terrace," "fluidly logical," "catalyze a change" feel elevated beyond the POV's working idiom. Minor loops appear: the vial's clarity/turbulence cycle is restated across multiple beats without adding pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the prior image, padding the closure. Stock metaphors ("like a mirror for the soul," "like a sieve for the mind") slightly dull precision. No major artifacts, but density could tighten by 10–15%.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean with no major loops or scaffolding. However, several stock phrases flatten key beats: "her heart quickened," "her breath catching," "sense of fulfillment," "unyielding curiosity." The final paragraph stacks abstract terms ("collective wisdom," "balance adventure with wisdom," "understanding," "legacy") that tell rather than show. Figurative language ("living mosaic," "pulse with faint, otherworldly light") decorates without adding causal pressure. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting but not character or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is maintained, but paraphrase loops appear: "encroaching darkness" is named in four separate sentences across paragraphs 2–5 without new detail. Template cadence in paragraph 6 ("She had succeeded... she had taught... she had lost") and synonym churn ("tendrils of shadow"/"suffocating grip"/"suffocating presence") reduce information density. The phrase "tender shadow keeper" recurs five times, functioning as a title rather than advancing characterization, and the final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, flattening closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paragraph structure varies and information density is adequate, but the prose carries template-cadence runs: "She was… Now, she…" in the opening, "The being led her… In the center… Elara activated it…" in the climax. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "mountain of diamonds," "dance between logic and intuition") appear in high-pressure beats without fresh vehicle. Filter-verb stacks ("began to vibrate," "seemed to warp," "began to condense") dull immediacy in the portal and machine sequences. No paraphrase loops, but the closure paragraph—"for the first time in years, she felt hope"—tells emotional state rather than charging the final image through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraphs create visual breathing room, but several beats rely on paraphrase loops and thematic labels rather than propulsion. "Eloquently silent" appears twice as a phrase-stamp without new information; "bridge of intuition" recurs three times, twice as ornamental metaphor. The gramophone sequence is concrete and advances action, but the bridge vision summarizes flashes and whispers ("She saw… She heard…") instead of dramatizing them with image density. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("keeper of a hidden truth, a bridge of intuition") that dilute the closing image's specificity. Stock metaphor "bridge of intuition" and therapy-adjacent phrasing "let the truth set her family free" in peak beats trigger template-cadence and register-drift penalties of approximately −0.6 in Q7. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") clusters in the vision beat without offsetting immediacy, adding minor line debt.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("vines pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat," "ink seeping into his skin like a tattoo"). Template cadence appears in the opening ("His once-fierce gaze…," "He clutched…," "It was the only remnant…") with repetitive "His/He" stems across three lines. Paraphrase loop: "allegiance…was not to a person or a cause, but to the idea that…there could be movement, change, life" restates the motivational claim without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines ("as reality itself began to shift") rely on summary rather than concrete action. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting penalty accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean with moderate information density. Opening paragraph establishes voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "a story of loss—it was a story of hope" and "not just a story of the past; it was a story of the present" repeat structure without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the third paragraph ("She brought out… She had learned… She decided then…"). The final paragraph stacks summary statements that tell outcome rather than dramatize: "lighter than it had been in years," "found her purpose," "not in the files themselves, but in the lives they represented." Modest line-level deduction (−0.6) for loops and scaffold; the closure beat is heavily summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple text artifacts degrade clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She was the underestimated rebel, the one they dismissed" then "a rebel who refused to be underestimated"; "carefully resourceful" is both an attribute and restated as "Mara was carefully resourceful." Template cadence runs ("She had…," "She was…," "Mara's…") dominate the opening third. Stock metaphors ("stars seemed to wink in approval," "hold the line," "ghost in their machine") cluster in the closure beat, dulling the final image. Figurative density is high without payoff; "suffixed humanity's spirit" and "auric lagoon" read as thesaurus choices that obscure rather than sharpen. These artifacts appear in the final third, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "The mist seemed to thicken... as though the grotto itself was listening" and "He felt a surge of energy, as if the grotto was lending him its strength" restate sympathetic-environment concepts across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "He played... He knew... He felt... He played on..." flatten propulsion in the climax. Stock metaphors ("threads of silk," "ghost," "diamonds") appear in most sentences of the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Figurative language is coherent but density without momentum lowers the score; the closure beat is dulled by synonym churn ("radiant," "luminescent," "glow," "brighten") rather than sharp action.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with vivid imagery ("moonstone cabochon dust speck, glowing faintly") and purposeful word choice. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops in key moments: "she felt a strange pull, a sense that this tiny object was more than it appeared" restates rather than advances, and the final paragraph's summary ("days turned into weeks") compresses pivotal action off-page. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") stack in the discovery beat, dulling immediacy. The opening and closing lines establish voice and stakes but the closure image is weakened by thematic over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentences vary in structure and the prose moves with reasonable clarity, but several beats loop or inflate without adding pressure: "Yet, despite his skill, the clocks he repaired rarely kept time accurately, earning him his peculiar moniker" recaps the prior sentence's point. The phrase "uncertainly certain purpose" and "when coincidence becomes pattern" feel like template-cadence constructions—elevated diction that announces theme rather than advancing action. The final paragraph stacks summary ("realized he had finally found his rhythm," "knew he had finally found his rhythm") that could be compressed. No major scaffold or syntax errors, but density and propulsion slip at closure when the piece most needs momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is high, but information density is low: adjacent sentences paraphrase without adding pressure ("The coin was not just an object but a vessel" / "carrying the weight of these names"). Template cadence appears in the vision beat ("a king who had… a mother who had… a wanderer who had…") spanning three parallel constructions. Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle: "thread waiting to be pulled," "fragments of a greater whole." The final paragraph stacks summary: "explored her limits, redeemed the coin, and in doing so, had begun to understand her own name."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally good. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "The gorge was a labyrinth… a place where time seemed to bend" restates mood without added pressure (−0.2). Stock phrasing: "hidden sunrise" recurs three times; "luminous ache" appears twice without reweighting (−0.3). Figurative language ("tapestry of sorrow and hope") in the climax beat reads generic rather than specific to Elara's perceptual signature (−0.3). No scaffolding or major template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("trees hummed," "bark warm and pulsing like a living thing"), but many beats stack metaphor without concrete anchoring: "ultraviolet penance," "mathematics of mercy," "symphony of ultraviolet penance" blur sense in high-pressure moments, costing −0.5 for register drift and mixed vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops appear: "The forest seemed to breathe with her" / "The forest seemed to respond to her thoughts" / "The forest seemed to whisper" recycle the same stem across three beats without added pressure, triggering −0.4 for template cadence. Sentence openings vary, but information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere rather than advancing action or knowledge. The closure beat ("she knew she had found what she was searching for") tells rather than shows the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "elusively tangible" recurs as a label without evolving function; "the lens fragment in her hand" is restated across beats; "honored," "unfastened," "anchored" cycle as thematic synonyms. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Lila's [noun]" or "The [noun]." Figurative density is high without muddle: "symphony of whispers," "eternal instant," "labyrinth of ropes" read as stock metaphors. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere rather than story. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems (Non-closure Accumulation Cap).

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies across beats; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is solid: most lines advance discovery or ghost presence. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "The ghosts grew bolder... One, a young girl... pointed upward. Marcus followed her gaze" recaps the same gesture, and "The façade was whole again, but he knew better—cracks always reappeared" restates the opening's "crumbling reminder." Template cadence emerges in the opening ("Marcus, an elevator repair technician... stepped inside, his toolbag slung... He wasn't here for repairs; he was drawn by..."), and the phrase "as if" recurs ("as if it had been left behind on purpose," "as if the building itself was healing"). The closing lines ("With a final look around, Marcus stepped out... the façade was whole again, but he knew better") summarize rather than propel. Minor figurative muddle: "cracks in the façade, not just in the walls but in the very fabric of the room" mixes physical and metaphorical registers without clarifying which is literal.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops appear: "the library was not just a repository of knowledge—it was a living entity" and "the patterns in the frost, the ruptures in perfect systems—they were all pieces of a greater puzzle" restate rather than advance. Template cadence runs through exposition: "She [verb]" structures repeat without variation. Stock metaphors ("her heart quickened," "the story was just beginning") dull the ending. Figurative language ("shimmering," "pulsed faintly," "rustling awakenings") appears densely without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed register (archaic "cradle her like a cradle") breaks rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is mostly maintained, though several sentences loop conceptually: "reimagining" recurs four times, "temporal plasticity" twice in exposition without fresh pressure. Figurative density is high ("labyrinth," "shimmering ribbons," "torrents of luminescence," "burnished sorrow") but metaphors remain decorative rather than propulsive. "Burnished sorrow" in particular is strained—burnished implies polished metal, not emotion. Paragraph rhythm is uniform; no sentence-level acceleration during the Hall infiltration. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully in opening and Covenant scenes. Metaphor density spikes without pattern payoff: "river that hummed with secrets," "gears wilting near dishonesty," "waterfall of stars" in quick succession. Paraphrase loop: "its gears wilting near dishonesty, as if it knew the stranger's words were a half-truth" restates within two clauses. Template cadence in journey paragraph: "took him through… Along the way… realized…" compresses transit into list. Stock fantasy register ("sanctuary of ticking gears," "tinkersong wonder") appears without voice motivation. No line-level opacity at closure, limiting deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "her [noun] [verb-ing]" stems appear in four consecutive beats mid-story ("her flashlight casting," "her psychometry reading," "her steps were," "her breath catching"). Stock phrases populate peak moments: "heart quickened," "breath catching," "spirit fuller"—bodily clichés without specificity. Mixed metaphor: "lagoon was a hinge, a gateway... where reality bent and time folded"—three incompatible vehicles (hinge/gateway/folding) in one breath. The final paragraph toggles between image (rain, scent) and summary ("touched something infinite," "mystery that would stay"), diluting closure propulsion. No major loops, but template cadence and figurative muddle at closure beats lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are present: "The slide was her latest muse, a gateway" restates "found it weeks ago…became her obsession" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She stepped forward…She approached cautiously…She placed her slide" across the climax. Stock metaphors: "storm itself was holding its breath," "bridge between eras." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "felt a profound sense of purpose…was no longer just a sculptor." Clarity and grammar are clean, but information density is low in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "quiet drive" recurs across beats without added pressure, "dawning hush" appears six times with minimal variation, and the final paragraph restates the central question mechanically. Template cadence is present in the studio-return sequence ("She worked through the night, driven by..."). Stock metaphors ("heart full," "whispered secrets") and figurative density in non-peak beats (the opening and closing paragraphs) accumulate to −0.8 in Q7. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; spatial choreography tracks without confusion. However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "secrets she had yet to unravel" / "cryptic entries hinting at a truth buried"; "voices long silenced, their stories demanding to be told" / "give voice to those whose stories had been erased"; "arranging beach debris as messages" is described three times across paragraphs with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("its shadow stretching," "its pages heavy," "its cryptic entries") and diary-handling beats. Stock metaphors cluster in peak moments: "burned like a torch," "thread in a tapestry," "mirror of the sky." Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings in peak beats (−0.4), total ~−1.3 in Q7. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold sentences ("She was retrocognitively trapped, her mind ensnared") restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph cuts mostly advance scene or knowledge. However, paraphrase loops appear: "to reimagine... to breathe life... conceiving something new... Revival meant creation" recycles the same concept across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "She saw... She imagined... She felt." Stock phrasing weakens peak beats: "heart pounding," "smiled, knowing," "disappeared into the horizon." Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, with varied syntax and strong paragraph rhythm. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. Information density is high in the decipherment sequence, and momentum builds steadily without loops. Minor redundancy: "a secret known only to a select few" and "among them was Elara" could compress, and "velvet disquiet" appears twice without evolving. The metaphor "steel and glass pierced the clouds" is vivid but borders on stock. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops in peak beats. The final image—hands on soil, speaking in the dead language—is concrete and propulsive. Proofreading is flawless; grammar, tense, and pronoun references are consistent and unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    Syntax varies and grammar is clean, but information density is low: multiple sentences restate concepts without advancing pressure (e.g., the acorn cap as "key" is repeated across paragraphs; "borrowed time" is named, then explained, then rephrased). Template cadence appears in the opening: "She was an heirloom seed saver... Her hands clutched... The acorn cap was..." Figurative language—"shimmering, winged being," "swirling void of light and shadow," "texture of borrowed time"—remains abstract rather than grounded. Minor paraphrase loops and stock metaphors ("wild serenity," "furiously tranquil") dull the final third. The closure beat is clear but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several artifacts accumulate: "strange connection" / "strange warmth" (synonym churn), "secrets only the credibly curious could decipher" (stock phrasing), and the template cadence "He paused… He reached… He felt" stacks filter verbs in the middle section. The phrase "vibrations that seemed to align with the rhythm of his own pulse" exemplifies overwriting—figurative language that adds texture without advancing the beat. Paragraph structure varies purposefully and the final image is vivid, but the cumulative line-level issues (paraphrase loops, elevated diction at peak beats) trigger a −0.6 to −0.8 deduction in Q7 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity and grammar are clean. Several paraphrase loops appear: "the lantern's glow intensified" / "patterns...that resembled falling stars" both describe the same visual effect; "understood" / "realized" / "felt" recur as synonym churn for insight. Template cadence runs through paragraph five: "She closed...She began...She cleaned...Her coworkers noticed." Stock metaphors cluster in the opening ("etched against the infinite void," "eternal canvas"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, applying −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: paragraph one cycles through "scorched wasteland," "skeletal remnants," "beauty faded but not entirely erased," and "cracked but still standing" without advancing pressure. Template cadence is visible in paragraph four: "He noticed symbols… patterns… whispers…" The final paragraph stacks summary claims—"profound sense of peace," "no longer just a recluse," "guardian of silence and keeper of promises"—that tell rather than show closure. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("weight of unspoken words," "whispers of the wind") recur without fresh inflection. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere or Elias's traits without advancing plot.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and paraphrase loops pervade: "The fragment felt *suddenly timeless*, as though it carried the essence of eternity" restates the same idea; "she felt a shift within herself, as though the silo's secrets were awakening something dormant" loops conceptually without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the garage-sale paragraph ("She carefully crafted... She wrote... she described... Each item became..."). The final paragraph stacks filter verbs and abstract claims ("she would trace its patterns, feeling the texture of time passing, a story etched in every line") that soften the closure image. Cumulative artifact debt (paraphrase loops, template stems, filter stack in closure beat) totals approximately −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies adequately, but several scaffold artifacts weaken density: "She was known for her ability to weave words into dawns" front-loads exposition, and "Her motivation was simple" is pure tell. Paraphrase loops appear ("the kite was unlike any she had seen before" followed by "As she approached, she noticed something peculiar"), and filter verbs cluster in the middle beats ("she examined," "she noticed," "she asked"). Stock metaphors ("her heart full," "eyes fixed," "smile playing on his lips") dilute specificity. The opening and closing images (cobalt lagoon, burnished hush) provide lyric bookends, but interior lines carry less information density than the length allows, with synonym churn ("warmly attentive" echoed as "warmly attentive spirit") and template-cadence reliance on "She [verb]" stems.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "The orchard was alive, not just in its leaves and roots, but in its spirit" / "The orchard stood as a living symbol of unity." Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He began with… He worked… He noticed… He discovered… He realized…" (five consecutive stems). Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle: "ancient sentinels," "bridge between worlds," "chorus of voices." Figurative language clusters without payoff: "brazen calm," "living testament," "whispered its gratitude." Apply −1.0 for loops + template runs + stock strings. Information density is moderate; many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and propulsive, with varied structures and concrete imagery ("golden translucence," "dusty footprints," "swirling with movement"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "chemistry of homecoming" appears three times without evolving meaning, and "bronze quiet" recurs as ornament rather than functional motif. The final paragraph summarizes theme overtly ("mirror reflecting the human condition," "artificial pilgrimage") where image alone would suffice. Information density is solid in the ascent and chamber beats but thins into abstraction at closure. Minor scaffold present but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple line-level patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("a bridge between the past and the present, a way to honor what was gone while nurturing what could be"), template cadence in the opening ("His eyes… His voice… The coachman's words… The coachman's motivation"), stock metaphors ("canopy of green," "whispers of hope"), and figurative density in nearly every sentence without pressure variation. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("narrow vastness," "submerged concord") that clashes with embodied action. These artifacts cluster throughout including the closure beat, triggering the artifact-in-final-third disqualification and −1.4 baseline in Q7. Information density is low: many sentences restate the same thematic content.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and key images (wax leaf, glowing cylinder) carry specificity, but several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "His curiosity, long dormant, stirred like embers catching flame" is immediately followed by "He took the leaf, turning it over in his calloused hands" without added pressure. The phonograph sequence includes filter-verb stacks—"he found," "he placed," "he fitted"—and the climactic moment ("revelations came in fragments") summarizes rather than dramatizes. "The leaf was a key, not to a physical location, but to a way of seeing" is abstract telling that replaces concrete scene work. Template cadence in the cabin visit ("Her face was smudged… her eyes darted… her voice dropped") flattens texture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.0)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: paragraph two ("The compass rose was more than a decoration; it was a key") restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the final two paragraphs with "each" anaphora. Stock metaphors ("ancient dance," "threads that connected these moments") cluster without fresh inflection. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to hum") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Prose artifacts touch the closure scene, disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatical, with varied structure and vivid imagery ("crystalline peaks shimmering with an otherworldly glow"). However, the climactic chess game compresses into summary—"hours turned to moments"—flattening what should be the story's highest-pressure beat. Phrases like "sacredly playful nature" and "cautious abandon" appear multiple times without concrete grounding, creating a mild template effect. The final paragraph recaps theme rather than trusting the image: "the greatest theft was the one that gave back more than it took." Information density is adequate, but pivotal moments lack dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple instances of elevated diction without grounding: "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless." Paraphrase loop in the opening: "echoes lingered…carrying the weight" restated as "listen—to the whispers, to the walls." Template cadence in paragraph three: "She felt…for she too had lived…moving from role to role." Filter-verb stack in final paragraphs ("felt," "knew," "realized") dulls immediacy at closure. Apply −0.8 for density and template issues touching the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries rhythm and visual variety, but several passages loop conceptually: "The pain of remembering had grown too sharp, too raw" near the opening is later restated as "The pain of remembering was not a curse but a catalyst." Template cadence appears in the climactic paragraph: "The mercury-glass seer was no longer fragmented; she was whole. The labyrinthine bookstore, the lost language stone, the texture of a feather—all had been tools…" Stock metaphors ("heart light for the first time in years," "maze was no longer a prison but a path") dull the closure image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffolding phrases ("She knew instinctively," "as if urging her to act") pad beats that warrant dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and grammatical but exhibits paraphrase loops ("her fidgeting now purposeful," "her hands moving with the precision") and template cadence in the labyrinth sequence ("Each step felt like…," "The thread unraveled, revealing…"). Stock metaphors recur (shadows clung, weight lifted, storm within) without fresh inflection. Information density is low; many sentences restate emotional state rather than advancing action or knowledge. No egregious artifacts touch the closure beat, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for loops and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence variety is present; rhythm modulates from the slow opening ("whispering void," "forged hush") to urgent mid-beat ("more urgent, more desperate") to calm closure. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops accumulate: "echoes pressing," "echoes repeating," "echoes grew louder," "echoes faded" recur without advancing pressure. "The mist swirled" / "The mist swirled faster" and "Each one a variation" / "each one a fragment" / "each one a step" form synonym cycles. Metaphor density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "skeletal fingers," "altar of peace," "tapestry of acceptance," "shattered mirror" within a single 700-word frame risks overwriting. The final paragraph summary—"The pale spire in mist had done its work"—tells closure rather than showing it, violating the momentum test at the decisive beat. Template stems ("She approached," "She pressed on," "She raised") and therapy-speak ("wound I choose to heal") cluster in high-pressure moments, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clear with varied sentence structure, though several passages loop conceptually: "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" appears three times with minimal reweighting, and "quilts memories together" recurs as synonym churn. The phrase "between breaths held underwater" is introduced, restated as metaphor, then invoked again at closure without adding pressure. Stock metaphors ("pitted like the moon," "heart pounding," "sense of peace") cluster in peak beats. Filter-verb reliance ("seemed to come alive," "felt like home") dulls immediacy at climax. Information density is adequate but momentum sags during the memory-vision interlude, which summarizes rather than dramatizes key images.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening and middle: "She was intimately aloof, her heart anchored in memories yet distant" restates itself across multiple lines. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She sat… her mind drifted… She stood… she decided"). Stock metaphors ("heart anchored," "soul laid bare," "tapestry of stories") lack fresh embodiment. The oasis description is clear and propulsive, lifting slightly. Artifacts touch multiple beats but do not fully obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "purify his doubts, to find clarity in the chaos" restates the same idea; "the vibrations of intent weren't just in the cork—they were in him" summarizes rather than dramatizing. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("not just of light, but of intention, of tenderness, of the quiet strength") stacks parallel prepositional phrases mechanically. Stock metaphor ("invisible thread," "screaming tenderness") appears without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "cryptic phone call" is repeated three times in adjacent lines; "the station… felt alive, as though it too was part of the endeavor" restates the same idea without added pressure. Stock phrasing in emotional beats ("heart swelled," "sense of purpose") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("the geography of loss," "the depths of the human heart," "the patchwork navigator had found her path") where concrete image would serve better. No severe artifacts touch the closure, but accumulated decorative phrasing lowers density.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clarity is generally strong, but several patterns create drag: "fractured grace" appears three times as thematic scaffolding without evolving meaning; "psychological safety" recurs as an abstract label rather than embodied pressure; the opening's "deliberate precision" and "rational mind weighing the risks" are generic descriptors. The phrase "involuntarily truthful" appears twice in close succession. Rhythm varies appropriately, but information density suffers from conceptual repetition across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and controlled rhythm. Repeated phrase structures appear ("The mist shifted," "The stranger had been," "Elias felt") and some paraphrase loops (the boutonnière described three times in similar terms: "relic," "token," "trust"). Filter verbs ("thought he saw," "felt a pang") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing immediacy. No severe artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 from base 6.5).

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings. Paraphrase loops appear: "a faint hum seemed to emanate from it" / "a sound that felt both familiar and alien" restates the same mystery without added detail. Stock metaphors accumulate: "whispered tales," "sanctuary of faded parchment," "weight of the promise." The summary span "over the following days" compresses the story's central conflict off-page, flattening momentum at the pivot. Figurative density in the cavern description (bioluminescent, shimmering, glimmering) does not obscure clarity but adds texture without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several sentences loop conceptually: the opening paragraph names "ember grotto" twice and "bleeding starlight" recurs without varied function. Template cadence appears in "She stepped inside... She recalled... She realized..." Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "lacy menace" appears twice without reweighting, and "softly commanding" is used identically in two separate beats. Propulsion suffers from these repetitions and the piece exceeds typical density for sustained figurative language without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The object was more than a relic; it was a key" restates without added pressure; "This isn't just a shell. It's a palette of resolve, a tool to anchor moments" cycles through synonyms. Template cadence runs: "Elara's motivation was clear... Elara explained her method... Elara smiled." Stock metaphors ("fragment of a forgotten star," "promise") in the closure beat dull immediacy. Filter verbs ("felt it," "felt the weight," "knowing that") stack in the final third. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems touching the ending; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several phrases loop conceptually: "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" recur as labels without evolving meaning; "chronologically confused thoughts swirling like leaves in a storm" and "fragments of her memories aligned" restate the same arc. Template stems appear: "She remembered—or thought she remembered" and "She felt herself lift off the ground, her body weightless, her spirit unbound" lean on stock interiority. No egregious clarity breaks, but figurative language in peak beats (scroll "pulsing," stars, mirages) accumulates without tight payoff. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work but many serve atmosphere over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs lower momentum: "loss and resilience" / "gift—or curse"; "occluded views, piecing together fragments" / "to navigate it differently"; repeated "She [verb], [object]" stems across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("breath of ancient mechanisms," "bridge between generations") and therapy-speak ("maps emotional terrain," "trembling calm") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. The closing paragraph is expository summary rather than image-driven propulsion, triggering artifact penalties. Information density is adequate early but flattens at closure, capping the score below 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("elastic" time, quill "crystallizing like frost"). Information density is generally high; setting and object details integrate with action. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically: "transform scars into stories" is restated across multiple lines ("no longer felt like marks of struggle but symbols of her journey"), and the closing summary ("she had found not just clarity, but herself") recaps rather than propels. These paraphrase loops and the final scaffold sentence ("quiet acknowledgment of her transformation") reduce propulsion and clarity at closure, triggering deductions here.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting debt: figurative language in most lines of the closure beat ("currents of memory," "ghostly flower," "beacon of memory") without pattern-teaching; mixed vehicle ("currents" both electrical and fluid). Template cadence in paragraph three: "The orchard outside was doomed... The air was thick... Elara's grandmother had loved..." Stock metaphor strings ("threads fraying," "smoke," "held breath") cluster without fresh specificity. Paraphrase loop: final paragraph restates the orchard's persistence three ways. Baseline −0.9 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, so 9+ disallowed globally and high-band capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, significant scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "not merely a collection of definitions but a key" / "not just a tool but a companion" / "not just the end of history witness but the beginning of a new unity" recycles the same syntactic template across pivotal beats. Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching: "weight of centuries," "bridge between languages," "coils of understanding," "labyrinth of knowledge" stack metaphors in adjacent sentences without on-page payoff. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("fragmented realities," "cosmic illusions") that flattens momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally strong and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He sought to understand what clocks really measured, not just hours or minutes, but the essence of time itself" restates the motivation across two clauses without adding pressure. The phrase "fjord quiet" and "eminently peculiar" read as elevated diction imposed on the voice rather than emerging from it. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("profound sense of peace," "his understanding... would never be the same") that summarize rather than dramatize the shift. Minor loop and scaffold issues accumulate to −0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are grammatically clean with varied structure and strong imagery ("lantern's light flickering like a heartbeat," "river breaking through a dam"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the lantern's mica pane is described almost identically in three separate beats without new detail or pressure. Template cadence runs ("She stood... She paused... She smiled") and phrase repetition ("theoretically rebellious," "widen perspectives responsibly") accumulate to −0.6, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately; sentences propel without loops. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor friction: "melodically haunted" in paragraph one is a label without immediate grounding, and "seemed to shimmer" / "seemed to echo" use filter verbs that soften precision. "The disc was smooth, its surface etched with faint grooves" is scaffold-adjacent (the second clause restates rather than advances). The ending image is clean and resonant. No major artifact debt, but a few lines could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the weight of small moments" / "ensure stories...never be lost"; "not just about preservation...about regeneration" / "not just to record but to participate." Template cadence surfaces in parallel constructions ("not just X but Y") across beats. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("structure that had endured," "locket...hum with untold stories"), but density is moderate—several sentences restate the archival mission without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several paraphrase loops: the opening repeats "station" and "overgrown" across adjacent lines; "the kind that..." construction in paragraph two loops without adding pressure. Template cadence: "She had come...She felt...She realized" stems recur. Stock metaphors appear: "air of mystery," "shield against the weight." Purple prose in the final paragraph: "polite anarchy of a life lived with hope and connection" obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.5)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "the ultrasonic forest hummed" recurs identically; "Each word a whisper," "each one a breadcrumb," "each line a testament" follow parallel stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("a quiet blaze," "liquid silence") cluster in high-pressure beats without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing closure, flattening momentum. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and individual sentences are clear. Paraphrase loops appear: "she had threshed meaning from experience, unbent the timeline" echoes earlier "thresh meaning from experience" without added pressure. Template cadence in the void sequence: "She saw... She saw... And she saw..." across three consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("crumpled sheet of paper," "web of cause and effect") in high-stakes beats reduce specificity. Figurative density in the void section (kaleidoscope, ripple, sea of light) blurs concrete action. Deductions total approximately −1.0 in Q7 for loops, template stems, and metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "Her hands moved fluidly, tracing patterns" / "Elara's fingers danced again" / "Her hands began to move once more" / "As her hands moved" recycles the same gesture-description without advancing pressure (−0.6). Template cadence with repetitive stems: "She thought of..." appears twice in close succession, and "The camera..." / "She..." sentence openers dominate (−0.4). Stock metaphors appear in peak beats: "shadow woven from starlight," "thread in a tapestry of emotion," "symphony no one else could perceive" blur rather than sharpen sense (−0.5). Clarity remains adequate but information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere without propelling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "not to burn but to uncover" / "purpose was not to burn"; "followed the trail" / "follow the trail"; "forgotten promise" appears six times without reweighting. Template cadence: "They [verb]" opener runs across six consecutive beats in the middle third. Stock phrasing: "heart quickened," "tears welled," "sense of closure." Apply cumulative artifact penalty of −1.2 for loops, stems, and cliché strings. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high without pattern payoff: "hush of the universe inhaling," "liquid memory," "threads in a frayed tapestry," "weaver of dreams" stack across beats without recharging prior material. Paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "instead of fading, had become a labyrinth" and "blurring the lines" restate the same entanglement without added pressure. Template cadence: "She remembered a childhood... a love... a purpose" in paragraph three. Register drift: "collective grief," "fabricated narratives," "cognitive" diction intrudes on the lyric voice. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("weaver of dreams"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies adequately; no egregious loops. "The labyrinth seemed to resist... containers groaning... shadows stretching" stacks three simultaneous participial clauses in one sentence, blurring sequence. "The coin felt warm... almost alive" / "the key... felt heavy with purpose" / "the air thick with anticipation" recycles "felt/thick" constructions. Figurative density is moderate: "shadows stretching unnaturally long," "the labyrinth's whispers growing louder" remain legible but lean atmospheric. Opening and closing lines anchor adequately, though "the quietest voices resonate the deepest" is thesis rather than image. Clarity remains high; no major propulsion stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "Their stillness was their strength" echoes "unobtrusive as the shadows," and "a little less heavy" / "shoulders lighter" restates the same relief. Template cadence in the final paragraph: three sentences begin with "The guardian [verb]" or "The stranger [verb]." Figurative density ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "canvas for pain") clusters without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Stock metaphor: "words tumbling out like pebbles into a stream."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive template cadence: many sentences open with subject-verb patterns and dependent clauses in repeated structures. Paraphrase loops abound—paragraph two's "method that would bring his vision to life" followed immediately by "displays would be his way of cradling the community." Abstract stock phrases ("seeds of doubt," "spark a humble rebellion," "weight of his mission") replace concrete imagery. The final paragraph stacks summary declarations without propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "plant forests of second thoughts" conflates agricultural and arboreal images awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and opening anchors are strong. The phrase "guarded heart" recurs three times without evolving pressure (ornamental loop). The climactic beat uses scaffold phrasing: "she felt," "she understood then," "she realized"—a stack of filter verbs that dulls immediacy. Sentence variety is present, and no catastrophic loops touch the closure, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies with paragraph length, but sentence stems repeat ("She had," "The turbines," "Elara's"). Paraphrase loops appear: "emotional void" recurs four times; "quiet rebellion" and "quiet resolve" are near-duplicates. Abstract constructions dilute clarity: "the remade hush that enveloped the world" tells rather than shows. Peak beats (whittling, window press, final placement) lack propulsion and rely on "seemed," "as if," and passive voice. No major coherence breaks, but density is low and momentum lags through reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "humming quartz colonnade," "second shadow") without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure (−0.5 density penalty). Paraphrase loops appear: "dissolving boundaries" recurs three times with minimal variation; "tremor of certainty" is repeated without reweighting (−0.3). Template cadence: "The poet stepped… their boots crunching… They reached out… their fingers brushing…" runs across multiple sentences (−0.5). Scaffolding and synonym churn dull momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a note in its endless melody"), triggering the escalated penalty (−1.7 total in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and vivid images ("shards of colored glass glinted like captured rainbows," "vibrate softly, as if stirred by an unseen hand"). Template cadence appears in the opening: "He often wondered… He had always been… He began to see…" runs of identical stems across adjacent lines (apply −0.4). Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "communicate through plant arrangements" is restated as "his secret language, one he used to barter awakenings" without added pressure (apply −0.2). Filter-verb stack in paragraph 3: "He began to see… felt deeply… no longer to replicate… to capture" clusters four filter constructions in close succession, dulling immediacy (apply −0.3). Information density is mid-range; some sentences do double work, but others explain what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and the prose is legible, with vivid images (the lens "faintly luminous," "whispers of ancient machinery"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the lens is described as both a "key" and a guide through "the labyrinth" and later again as revealing "the path to understanding"—three adjacent metaphors restating the same function. Template cadence runs in the sound-fragment paragraphs ("The first sound was… Next came… As the sounds continued"), each following identical stem structure. Figurative language density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff (prism, compass, symphony, spectrum, waves). Register drifts into academic phrasing ("mechanization," "duality of progress") during Elara's interiority. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong. Minor loop: "The observatory itself was a place of paradox, genuinely artificial in its construction" followed by two sentences re-describing its walls and telescope feels mildly redundant. "Her hands, once deft and sure, now moved with a subdued ardor" opens with clean specificity. The phrase "She realized the curtains of intention had chosen her, responding to her quiet yearning" is tell-heavy summary that compresses the causal hinge into abstraction. Stock metaphor "like a lifeline" and "hollow" are functional but not fresh. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful detail. Opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, several instances of near-paraphrase appear: "map cultural patterns"/"mechanics of deception itself," and the measuring-tape metaphor is restated multiple times without added pressure. Stock metaphor clusters appear in peak beats: "liquid patterns," "storm clouds," "living map" trend toward generic figurative language. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("testament to their collaboration," "intertwined with their discovery," "map its ascent") that summarize rather than show the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "Its surface shimmered with hues of amber and indigo, casting fragmented light across the chamber, as if the very atoms of nostalgia were alive within its metallic lattice" stacks metaphor without clear image. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She had learned to navigate its whims, to trust her instincts, to let the archive guide her" runs parallel infinitives. Paraphrase loop: "The pagoda was not a key to knowledge, but a mirror" is restated as "she had unlocked something far greater." Several stock metaphors ("fragile threads," "hollow places within her soul") dull specificity. Cumulative penalty −0.8 for density and loop issues; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are evident: "She had always been drawn to the moments when day surrendered to night, a transition she found both beautiful and haunting" repeats conceptually in adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She worked… But her true passion lay… Her latest obsession was…" Stack of "she [verb]" stems across multiple sentences. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "blooming library," "captured sunsets," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret" all appear but do not build pressure or constrain choice. "Softly deliberate" recurs three times as a label without varying function. Stock metaphor "heart alight" and therapy-speak "luminous regret" in the final paragraph lower precision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "layers of naivety, layers of fear, layers of doubt" and "not defined by the deception but by her response to it" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs ("She thought of... She recalled... She felt..."). Stock metaphors ("layers peeling away like old paint," "stars pulsed with encouragement") and therapy-speak ("balance self-respect and compassion") appear in peak beats. The final paragraph stacks summary assertions that dull the closure image. Apply −1.4 for multiple distinct artifacts; an additional −0.3 for touching the closure beat with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "She didn't know what it meant, but the urgency…left no room for hesitation" echoes the prior sentence's urgency claim without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the tunnel sequence: "She saw herself as a child…She saw a younger version…" (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("sanctuary of stillness," "labyrinth of shadows and echoes," "testament to the miracle") and filter-verb stacks ("felt different," "seemed to spiral," "began to shift") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). The closure beat ("The scars on her soul began to fade") abstracts the moment into summary rather than concrete image. Cumulative line-level debt totals ~−1.1, placing the category in the low-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and no major loops or grammatical errors. Information density is adequate, though some sentences do single duty (e.g., "The projection booth was a time capsule"). Minor scaffold appears: "It was a peculiar film strip" and "Her motivation was peculiar" echo phrasing. The "hushed thunder" simile for the projector's hum is vivid, but "as if it held a secret waiting to be uncovered" and "as if it were waiting for her to decide" are stock constructions that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is clear, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: the second and third paragraphs restate Lira's gift and motivation with synonym churn ("unspoken words" / "whispers of the universe"; "trapped creativity" / "scattered...waiting to be reclaimed"). Template cadence: "She was known for...," "Her gift—or curse...," "Her motivation was clear..." stack filter-heavy declarative stems. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "something just out of reach") and the therapy-speak phrase "shadowed rapture" in the final beat lower line-level craft. Deductions total approximately −1.4 for loops, cadence, and filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence clarity and grammar are clean with no major errors. However, template cadence appears in the opening ("The dune was in bloom... After the last forest burned... Mara's eyes scanned...") and repetitive phrasing recurs (multiple "the dune" and "the clock" subject stems). Stock fantasy phrasing reduces specificity: "otherworldly light," "charged with energy," "surge of hope." Information density is low; several sentences restate the same content (e.g., the charm's wave-function power is described, then immediately "she had never tested its power"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening: "void, a silence where insight should have been" repeats the same lack across adjacent lines. Template cadence in paragraph four: "flowers that bloomed…streams that flowed…trees whose roots…" stacks parallel constructions without variation. Stock metaphors abound—"labyrinth," "mosaic," "wild frontier"—without fresh inflection. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, and "he felt ready to embrace it" is a placeholder emotion lacking embodied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language generally serves atmosphere ("mist clinging to her skin like a second cloak"). However, the opening and closing thirds show paraphrase loops: "The leash had broken weeks ago—the one that tethered her to the life she thought she wanted" restates the same idea, and the final paragraph recycles freedom imagery ("The leash was gone, the ticket punch a memory. She was free") without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "she + past-tense verb" constructions across adjacent lines. No severe opacity or scaffolding, but density sags at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language ("blanket of snow," "frostbitten hope") is dense but coherent, though some phrases ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") recur as labels without fresh context. Paraphrase loop appears in the opening: "silence" and "quiet" restated across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence: "He would sit… and listen" / "He knelt, brushing away…" / "He reached out, his fingers trembling…" repeats "He [verb]" stems across high-pressure beats. Minor filter-verb stack in the discovery sequence ("he noticed," "he knelt," "he pushed," "he saw") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes closure ("He was no longer just the silent-choir bellhop; he was the keeper…") instead of dramatizing the shift through image. Information density is moderate; some sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence openings vary adequately. Paraphrase loops appear: "The pretender...had woven lies" / "she would tear apart the pretender's illusions" recycle the same claim across paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without grounding: "shadow cast by a false light," "tapestry of truth," "weight of centuries" (three instances). Figurative density in the climax paragraph ("frailty," "whisper that carried the weight of centuries") obscures physical action. No filter-verb stacks, but template cadence in middle paragraphs ("Her first message...She knew...She carved") applies −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and no major loops. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (e.g., tapping rhythms anchor both character habit and theme). However, the final paragraph drifts into exposition: "The coastline...had been a site of early fossil fuel extraction" reads as Wikipedia summary rather than dramatized discovery. The closing thesis ("Some paths disappear...") is scaffolding that tells theme instead of showing cost. Template stems appear occasionally ("She tapped...a habit," "She turned it over, searching") but remain under threshold. Figurative language (sentinel, fragments of puzzle) is spare and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and spatial choreography is clear. Information density is solid in the opening and stone-circle beats. However, the vision sequence leans on abstract high-level descriptors ("vibrant, living constellations," "shimmering thread," "thunderous serenity") rather than concrete particulars. Paraphrase loop in the closing: "thunderous serenity of the cosmos, the hum of the ancient stones, and the quiet confidence" restates the vision's meaning rather than advancing it. The phrase "awkward confidence" appears three times without evolving.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The embryo was no ordinary relic. It pulsed faintly, as if alive" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She closed her eyes... She straightened... She turned back... She unwrapped it... She knew..." Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Stock metaphors ("steam rose like ghosts," "roots spreading like a silent army") reduce specificity. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("The Reconstruction was not just about rebuilding—it was about reimagining") that summarize rather than propel. Line-level clarity is functional, but momentum drags under repetitive stems and scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail and clean choreography. However, the text carries paraphrase loops ("She wasn't healed, not entirely, but she had found a way to carry her pain without being consumed by it" restates the prior paragraph's arc) and template cadence in reflection-heavy passages. The phrase "pearl of stillness" appears three times with identical framing, and the final paragraph stacks summary statements ("not as a survivor seeking refuge, but as an artist capturing the resilience") that tell rather than show the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. However, pervasive figurative density ("luminescent ache," "threads of despair," "tapestry," "portal to stories") without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "Maybe the darkness isn't something to escape...Maybe it's where the light begins" restates the concept twice in adjacent lines; "no longer a burden—it was her guide, her muse, her truth" stacks synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("its shelves whispering encouragement...her hands steady, her heart alight") applies −0.4. Total −0.9 from high-6 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and varies rhythm across paragraphs, with strong sensory moments (metallic wings glinting, cool glass, ephemeral patterns swirling). However, template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("She had spent years honing her skills, but this mission was unlike any other. Time itself seemed to bend…"), and several stock constructions dilute immediacy ("her heart quickened," "tears welled in Elara's eyes"). The final paragraph's elevated register ("a testament to the power of understanding over control," "the wind carried her story") feels imposed rather than earned. No paraphrase loops, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing and template cadence: "bravely conflicted" appears three times, "echoing library under snow" recurs without functional variation, and "dizzying quiet" is used twice in similar constructions. Paraphrase loops are evident—paragraph five's "her hands shook as she read, her mind reeling" restates what the prior sentence already conveyed through "the data streamed before her, a flood of information that threatened to overwhelm." Figurative language ("a ghost in the machine," "a shroud") leans on stock metaphors. Sentence openings show some variety, but the final two paragraphs stack similar constructions ("As she turned," "As the transfer completed") that flatten momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is largely clear and grammatically clean. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos" is restated in the final line nearly verbatim. "Tranquil" recurs in "tranquil space" and "tranquil blaze" without variation in meaning. Metaphors are strained ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") and border on contradiction. The transition "As the days passed" is a summary scaffold that compresses key escalation. Information density is moderate; many beats do double duty, but some lines (e.g., tool description) are purely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but scaffolding and paraphrase loops appear frequently: "silence had a voice"/"absence of noise created its own symphony," "breaking their own patterns"/"paths unpredictable," "both wild and still"/"untamed and soothing." Template cadence runs in paragraph two ("It was a place where… where…") and five ("she said, and the garden erupted… a lullaby that was…"). Stock metaphors ("light and shadow," "flame in the wind") and the phrase "emotions transliterated" (repeated thrice) dull line-level propulsion. Deductions total approximately −1.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops, template stems, and synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear and free of major loops, but several beats rely on summary rather than scene: "Over tea in the director's office, she subtly probed for answers" compresses what should be a pressure point. The opening's phrase "orbits of regret" recurs three times without earned variation, and "solemn playfulness" is declared but not enacted in rhythm or diction. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent, though "echoing observatory" and "orbits of regret" lean ornamental. Sentence variety is adequate, but the final paragraph's explicit theme statement dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The dissonance was gone, not because she had silenced it, but because she had learned to listen" restates the prior paragraph's summary without added detail. Template cadence: "Her own fate felt similarly sealed… This firmware… was the source… It whispered to her…" uses parallel "X was Y" constructions across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors: "dagger twisting in her heart" and "key unlocking a door." Figurative density in the opening paragraph (constellation tattooist, laboratory of lost sounds, time folds, haunted firmware) front-loads images without integrating them into action until mid-story. Information density is moderate but momentum sags during backstory exposition. No major artifact obscures closure, so penalties remain within-band (−1.2 cumulative for loops, templates, stock metaphors).

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence variety is adequate and grammar is clean. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The moment the flake touched the sand, the grotto seemed to hold its breath. The mist thickened, and the whispers of the tiles faded into a collective stillness" restates the same beat without added pressure (−0.2). "Emergent hush" and "lilac unease" are repeated across four paragraphs as stock phrases without evolution (−0.3). Information density is moderate; key beats (the vision, the dissolution) lack concrete propulsion. No figurative muddle or template cadence, but clarity could be tighter at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and spatially coherent. However, template cadence pervades: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara's [noun]" or "The [noun]," and synonym loops recur ("renaming" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences). Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "seeds of what she hoped to cultivate") and therapy-speak labels ("gentle radical," "retrocognitively trapped") cluster in reflective passages. Information density is moderate; many lines paraphrase the renaming project without advancing pressure. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for template cadence and synonym churn combined.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies across the piece with some strong images ("petals unfurling like secrets," "air shimmering like heat over a flame"). Paraphrase loops appear: "the garden responded—the whispers grew louder, the shadows deeper" is immediately followed by "the air grew warmer, the shadows softer, and the whispers turned to harmonies," restating the garden's atmospheric shift without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "She closed her eyes… She stepped forward… She reached the center… She drew the tarot coin" and later "She looked at Mara… She nodded… She smiled… She turned" (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("the moon hung low," "secrets," "symphony") cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("swirling like paint in water," "shimmering like heat over a flame," "storm of blues and grays") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.3). Total artifact deductions: −0.9 in Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "She had always been drawn to the unseen, the unspoken, the hidden pathways" mirrors "unseen… unspoken… hidden" in adjacent beats; "her skepticism was her shield, but her affection for humanity was her compass" and "her affection… had guided her, her skepticism had sharpened her focus" recycle the same metaphor pair. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to pulse," "felt like a key") dull immediacy. Stock phrases ("soft luminescence," "tapestry of blues and silvers," "one light painting at a time") and the thematic-echo ending ("fractally precise beauty of the unseen") flatten the closure beat. Accumulated artifact penalties apply: −1.4 for loops, template stems, and metaphor recycling across pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no sustained template cadence. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 4 and 5 both assert the fossil is a "key" and Elara's role as "storyteller/voice of the unknown" with synonym churn ("not just mapping…uncovering," "not just as a map maker but as a storyteller"). Stock metaphor: "breathing feelings into the air." The phrase "voice of the unknown" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Clarity remains high; information density is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The echo was not just a sound but a fragment of shared wisdom, a truth waiting to be pieced together" restates the premise without advancing it. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines ("unscramble," "unscrambling," "unravels"). Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh inflection: "amber warehouse," "hourglass turner," "threshold between worlds." Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("spin a prophecy into raw possibility") that clashes with the concrete task of sorting buttons. The final two paragraphs recycle scaffolding ("her work was far from over," "ready to unscramble the next mystery") without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and paragraph structure varies, but several lines loop conceptually: "fixing what's broken" appears twice in identical phrasing, "unused courage" recurs without added pressure, and "the tilt of the earth toward spring" is repeated as metaphor without development. Template cadence in the middle ("Each step was a gamble, each code a puzzle") feels mechanical. Figurative density is high ("mist clung," "snow whispered secrets," "canvas waiting to be filled") but mixed vehicles do not clarify. Information density is low—long stretches advance atmosphere without plot or knowledge. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative language is dense and sometimes strained: "time seemed to percolate through the air" mixes metaphors (percolation and dissolution), and "roots seeking water" for attention feels stock. "Spindrift serenity" recurs ornamentally without escalating pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The promise is not a thing to be found but a truth to be revealed" and "not an answer but a way of seeing" restate the same concept. Sentence openings vary, but some scaffolding ("He knew his journey...") stalls momentum. No major clarity issues, but texture over-relies on abstract elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately and the prose is largely grammatical, but pervasive minor issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "The glass thrummed softly" / "Each creation thrummed faintly" / "The glass continued to thrum" repeats the same beat without added pressure. Stock phrases cluster in emotional moments ("deep sense of peace," "felt a connection," "enduring power"). The opening balances vivid detail ("sun beat down relentlessly," "hives crumbling") with momentum, but the final third shifts into summary mode that tells rather than shows ("The oasis slowly began to heal"). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in key beats. The prose is functional but lacks the density and propulsion expected at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("luminous harbor by moonlight," "rhythm of oars in water"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (the tooth's moonlight catch anchors both object and atmosphere). Template-cadence risk in paragraph openers: "She believed…," "She paused…," "Curiosity tugged…," "He hesitated…" form a mild pattern but do not loop within single beats. Stock phrases appear: "the world held its breath" (twice), "edges sharp yet strangely comforting," "as if their paths had been destined." The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, and "quivering hush wrapping around them like a blanket" mixes metaphor (hush wraps? blanket?). Deduct baseline −0.6 for template stems and stock metaphor strings; no closure-beat contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "brittle determination" / "brittle awakenings" / "brittle light"; "hum" / "humming" / "hum growing louder" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section—"She stepped away," "She paused," "She approached," "She placed"—flattens propulsion, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors: "clouds swirled like a restless sea," "library was alive," "world around her dissolved." Register drift into quasi-technical diction ("atomically reflective," "celestial tides") clashes with the fantasy frame. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns—"embodiment," "bridge," "beacon," "promise"—that obscure concrete closure. Artifacts touch the closure beat, applying −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound with varied sentence structure. Several phrases trend toward stock spiritual language: "washed clean," "invisible web," "tapestry," "thread that connects all things." Paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "Her motivation was clear" immediately followed by restating the same goal. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in the climax without voice motivation. Momentum is steady but information density is low—long passages describe atmosphere without advancing choice. No major artifacts obscure causality, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "a message, a power play" and "chaos and deception" repeat the trickster concept without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks reassertions—"grit," "peace," "mysteries," "ready"—in place of a charged image. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but propulsion slows in the last third as scaffold phrases accumulate ("far from over," "just one player").

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and flows without major loops or scaffold. However, figurative density is high across many beats without clear payoff: "the compass needle transfixed," "the air vibrating with the reverberation," "shadows closing in, threatening to swallow her whole," "the organ's melody echoed in her soul." Mixed metaphors appear ("the chamber seemed to exhale," "the veil between realms thinned") without coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She realized then…" "She closed her eyes…" "When she opened her eyes…" Stock phrases ("heart pounding," "deep breath," "smiled") repeat without variation. The cumulative effect dulls line-level propulsion and blurs the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops and template cadence weaken momentum: "The ribbon, now crumpled… felt like a fragile thread" adjacent to "traced the ribbon's frayed edge, imagining the hands"; "Her methodical mind raced" echoes "Her methodical nature had led her"; "furrowed concentration" recurs as "furrowed" motif. Stock metaphor ("ghostly shroud," "clockwork mechanism," "fragile thread") appears in three of the first four sentences, reducing specificity. The closure paragraph stacks figurative language without fresh synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The station groaned around her, as if answering her doubts with a warning" restates prior atmospheric hums without adding pressure; "The copper nail trembled in her hand" and "seemed to pulse in her hand" recycle the same beat. Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "voice steady despite her fear," "eyes alight with recognition") flatten texture at key moments. The final paragraph summarizes outcome ("journals intact but no longer cryptic," "wind had stilled, the sky clear and calm") rather than landing on a charged image. Information density is moderate but dulled by scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy loop and scaffold debt: "dynamically observant" appears three times, "pixelated" four times, "luminous disbelief" twice; "scaffold wrap flutters" is repeated verbatim. Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (glass flake description) and middle (recounting the hitchhiker's words). Key beats—finding the clearing, unraveling layers—are summarized in passive gerunds ("began to unravel") rather than dramatized. Template cadence runs appear: "Bridge-Song [verb]… the fiddler [verb]…" Figurative language ("melody of possibility") in the final line feels imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear and grammatical; no orientation debt or pronoun confusion. Sentence variety is moderate; paragraphs vary in length. Minor scaffold appears: "He was perceptively calm, a trait inherited..." is label-only; "his mind working like a puzzle solver" abstracts rather than shows; the phrase "dusky harmony" recurs but without cumulative charge. Template cadence in the journal discovery beat: "Its pages were filled... The writer... had documented... Elias read her words..." loops through similar stems. No loops obscure causality, so deductions remain within-band.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "not just to record but to understand, to witness" echoes "not just knowledge but a way to heal" and "not just decoded inscriptions but unlocked a truth" without added pressure. Template stems recur ("The observatory, once…had become"; "Her gift…was not just about…but about"). Stock metaphors ("river of light," "threads…into a tapestry") lack fresh angles. Information density is low in the final paragraph, which summarizes rather than propelling. Routing −0.8 cumulative for loops and scaffold that dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some scaffold phrasing recurs: "The seed had come to her after..." and "The seed, she realized, was not just..." follow similar template cadence. The phrase "her warlike serenity" appears three times, with slight rewording each time, creating a loop that foregrounds the motif without always advancing pressure. "The air was thick with the scent of ripe fruit and decay, a paradoxical blend that mirrored the guarded druid's own nature" reads as slightly on-the-nose symbolic convenience. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She knew," "she sensed," "she realized") in peak beats dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    Sentence openings show some variety, but several beats loop synonym variants ("The maze seemed to pulse… the maze revealed its secrets… The maze shuddered"). Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "heart pounded") appear in high-pressure moments without fresh embodiment. Information density is moderate—many lines advance setup but few do double duty with subtext or constraint. The closure paragraph stacks assertions ("balance restored," "harmony restored," "purpose fulfilled") that paraphrase rather than deepen. No severe opacity, but also minimal propulsion or textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is largely clean with good rhythm variation and vivid imagery ("tree roots snaked between bones like ancient veins"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "fiercely gentle" appears three times without evolving, "inlaying meaning everywhere" is repeated verbatim, and the final paragraph restates "patch holes, inlay meaning, mend souls" in near-synonym fashion. Template cadence is minimal, but stock metaphors ("thread of purpose," "fabric of the place") and the phrase "glow of half-lit corridors" recur without reweighting, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, but suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "emptiness he felt inside" / "void he felt within"; "what was he supposed to do with it? With himself?" restates the same content without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "fractured," "unmoored," "bridge," "scar on the earth." Template cadence in the reflection-heavy middle ("He had come here...," "He thought of...," "He could tell you...") slows momentum. The final paragraph stacks summary statements rather than propelling through action. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock strings in non-closure beats; −0.3 for template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and moves forward without major loops, though "haunted ambitions" recurs as a thematic anchor without evolving. Some scaffold phrasing: "with a mix of," "as though," "felt a sense of." The opening "where the air shimmered" and closing "felt at peace" frame the arc, but peak moments rely on telling ("flooded with visions," "wave of understanding"). Information density is moderate; sentence rhythm varies adequately. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed") in emotional beats without earning immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is high; no major grammar or punctuation errors. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the meditative tone. However, several scaffold phrases appear: "She believed that," "She thought about," "This realization brought her," and the paraphrase loop in the opening (atrium described, then "The atrium was a vast…"). Stock metaphor "tapestry of opposing threads" and the phrase "wintersun serenity" (used twice) signal template cadence. Information density is moderate; the reflective passage on identity could compress. Apply −0.6 for loops and template artifacts per Q7 guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and sentences open with different structures, avoiding mechanical monotony. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear ("It was a vessel, a carrier of something profound" restates without adding detail) and synonym churn weakens density ("confessions, perhaps, or pleas" / "confessions etched inside the pearl's spiral" / "confessions became audible"). Figurative language clusters heavily in the final chamber scene ("crown… emanated a quiet power," "walls… seemed to soften," "beacon") without clear necessity, reducing propulsion at the closure beat. Template cadence runs in paragraphs three and four ("She placed… She saw… She saw… She knew").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is mostly clear and grammatically clean. However, several text artifacts appear: "gleezing" (line 1) is a non-standard coinage that disorients without payoff; "accordion bellows patched with tape" and "map references" are reiterated across paragraphs with near-synonym phrasing ("vessel for map references," "fragments found in riverside towns," "series of lines and dots"). The phrase "allude to her own story" in the final paragraph is a diction error (likely "attend to" or "articulate" was intended). Template cadence in the final two paragraphs: "She looked… she whispered… she took a deep breath… she found" creates a mechanical rhythm that flattens the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or causality breaks. However, scaffold phrasing recurs ("She knew," "she realized," three instances) and the piece leans on filter verbs ("she gazed," "she knew instinctively," "she paused, listening") that dull immediacy during key beats. Figurative language is competent but stock ("mist parting like a curtain," "heart raced"). Sentence openings show variation, yet information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice, particularly in the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences: "The violin was more than an object; it was a key, a whisper of a perforated destiny" repeats the same concept across two clauses without adding pressure. "They spoke of change, of a storm brewing in the roots of the world, and of her role in it" is a list-like expansion that delays content. "The plants whispered again, their voices urgent" is told-only and recaps prior action. Template cadence appears in the climax: "She closed her eyes, letting the telepathic chorus of the plants guide her. With a deep breath, she drew the bow across the strings." Stock metaphors: "sea of uncertainty," "ghosts of decisions past and future," "thorn in her resolve." Figurative density in the opening ("hum with a life of its own," "threads that bound it to empires," "velvet-draped ferns") slows the beat without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph—"The story was far from over, but for now, she had done what she could. And that, she realized, was enough"—is boilerplate closure phrasing. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, stock metaphor strings trigger baseline −0.6 to −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful imagery (aurora pulsing, emerald's light spreading). Several paraphrase loops appear: "Her task was unlike any other" followed by a restatement; "the grotto seemed to hold its breath" echoed by "radiant hush." Template cadence runs in paragraph four: "Elara paused...She had always felt...With a deep breath, she pressed..." Filter-verb reliance ("felt a pull," "felt a shift") dulls immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("her heart alight," "colors dancing") reduce specificity. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in key beats: the opening's "quiet unrest… a yearning she couldn't name" is restated as "source of her discontent clearer," and the closing's "find peace… felt whole… find her source of contentment" cycles through synonyms. Template cadence: "The object… was more than… it was…" and "not just… but…" structures repeat. Stock metaphors: "warm embrace," "thread of resilience," "path to light." Filter-verb stack in the lake sequence: "She saw herself… she saw… visions flooded." Register drift into elevated abstractions ("the transformation that came from living fully") clashes with the urgency of the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean and free of major loops, but several beats rely on paraphrase and scaffold: "his motivation was simple yet profound" is followed immediately by restating that motivation; "the cloak of doubt" appears three times as a label without evolving function. Register occasionally elevates beyond immediate scene need ("a conscience for hire, known for his ability to navigate…"). Information density is moderate—many sentences advance atmosphere but not choice. The final paragraph summarizes impact ("shaping Mara's journey in ways he couldn't yet foresee") rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The trance was not just a meditation; it was a confrontation, a reckoning…" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Metaphoric phrasing is dense but occasionally muddles: "sycamore hush" as a sound quality for a grotto lacks clear vehicle logic, and "carefully woven truth" recurs three times without variation. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens multiple beats mechanically. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or reflection—but the climactic revelation is summarized in a single sentence ("She told of her discovery…of how she had used it") rather than dramatized, dulling closure propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied. However, paraphrase loops and stock metaphor strings cluster in key beats: "towers of bone rose like sentinels guarding secrets," "weathered by time and resolve," "the weight of history," "echoes of the towers." The climactic turn—"The arrowhead in their hand seemed to vibrate in response"—relies on passive filter construction during peak pressure. Template cadence ("Each dive and ascent, each shift in formation") and synonym churn ("stillness," "pulse," "resolve") recur without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; multiple sentences restate atmospheric mood without advancing choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and no major grammatical errors. Paragraph structure varies purposefully across expository setup, action, and reflection. However, paraphrase loops appear: "lingering luminance" recurs five times without reweighting meaning, and synonym churn ("brilliance dimness," "brilliance of the spire's glow") pads texture. Template cadence runs in paragraph four: "he felt…," "as though…," "as if…" stack across three sentences during the mist-walking beat. Stock metaphors ("sea of brilliance dimness," "surge of energy") appear in the closure beat, reducing specificity when precision matters most. Applying −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for stock phrasing in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythm varies, but several beats carry decorative metaphor that dilutes momentum: "meteor hush that seemed to cradle the world in its palm," "luminous vow that hovered in the air." The phrase "wandered purposefully" is an oxymoron left unresolved. Paraphrase loops appear: "The books seemed to whisper to him" followed immediately by "their titles written in a language he couldn't read but somehow understood." Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") stack in high-pressure beats without voice justification, and the final paragraph summarizes rather than showing the reweighted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paragraph two opens with a paraphrase loop: "She had spent years studying the method of understanding static bursts, deciphering patterns in the noise" restates the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("drawn her like a magnet," "beacon of hope") and synonym churn ("ambered glass," "ambered expanse," "ambered observatory deck") accumulate without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). The final paragraph deploys three adjacent summary sentences beginning with "The" or "It," creating template cadence (−0.4). Information density is low; many sentences restate situation rather than advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; spatial choreography tracks through the observatory without error. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "echoes of what had been" / "echoes of forgotten phrases" / "new echo" recur without progressive charge, and "crystallize" and "scattered light" appear in multiple forms as thematic touchstones rather than functional narrative detail. The final paragraph summarizes the transformation ("Her heartbreak had not been in vain; it had led her here") instead of trusting the image to land alone. Information density is moderate; some beats double as atmosphere and action, but others rehearse the same interior claim.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual breaks around each restoration step. Clarity is generally high, though some lines veer toward ornament: "its arches humming with renewed energy" and "earnestly naive" repeat the prompt phrasing without transformation. Minor scaffold appears: "He'd noticed" and "he believed" are filter-heavy openers, and "the dripping rates" recurs as a phrase without vivid sensory grounding. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is moderate—many sentences advance the repair sequence—but the middle section (cleaning, alloying, rejoining) could tighten; each step is narrated in similar rhythm without propulsive variance. Figurative language (whispers of storms, melody of droplets) is coherent but leans soft.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose carries multiple artifact patterns: template stems ("The vigilant levee warden," "The sapphire-hued label," "The townspeople gathered"), synonym churn ("resurfacing" recurs in varied forms without added meaning), and stock metaphors ("stars...like pinholes," "beacon," "catalyst"). Paraphrase loops appear (paragraph 2 restates the photographs' content across three sentences; paragraph 6 recycles "resurface" and "forgotten" motifs). These patterns flatten momentum at key beats and place a −1.0 cumulative deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is adequate; no confusing pronouns or timeline breaks. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The orchard was alive… The orchard seemed to sigh… the orchard—all were part of…" recycled stems. "Touch of wonder" appears four times across beats without reweighting. Figurative language is dense but often stock ("kaleidoscopic," "dance," "weaver of wonder") without specificity. Penalize −0.8 for loops and cadence artifacts that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "not just a duty but a silent vow," "not just a tool…a reminder," "not just a recollection but a guide," "not just a solution but a lesson" (−0.6). Template cadence: "Every step was deliberate, every decision weighed." Filter-verb stacks in the climb paragraph flatten immediacy. Stock metaphors: "weight of responsibility," "testament to the power of perseverance." The final paragraph summarizes meaning already declared, adding no new pressure. Clarity is maintained but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "emotional rebirth" / "reclaim their fragmented soul"; "the brain is not just an object" / "a piece of you." Template cadence runs through the duel sequence ("Each strike…each parry"). Figurative language stacks without coherence: "dance of complementary opposites," "spark of emotion long dormant," "vivification of their soul"—mixing registers and vehicles. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image. Penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.5, figurative muddle −0.4, total −1.1 in Q7 baseline; artifacts touch closure (summary ending), further −0.6, cumulative −1.7.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "mournfully eager" appears three times, "pull cord handle" recurs in identical noun phrases across beats, and synonym loops ("plea, a prayer, a desperate attempt"; "louder, more insistent") bloat without advancing pressure. Template cadence is evident in stacked "He [verb]" and "Eli [verb]" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. Metaphors strain coherence: "macerate the stillness" (literal grinding applied to abstract silence) and "off-key wind" (wind cannot be off-key; the lullaby is off-key, wind carries it) muddle the vehicle. These artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats (the symphony crescendo) and touch the closure paragraph ("tended to the unspoken" is label-speak), triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("shards of obsidian," "mist seeped into her pores"). Figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, template openings recur ("Elara's…" x3 in close proximity), and several lines loop conceptually: "the garden's beauty both haunting and fleeting" mirrors "the garden remained frozen, the mist eternal." Stock phrases appear under pressure ("her heart quickened," "her mind raced"). The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("sentinel of light and shadow," "space between") without concrete image anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear and varies sentence structure, but several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "failures were not missteps but steps" / "each failure bringing her closer"; "not just a broken symbol of faith; it was a key, a catalyst" (synonym churn without added pressure). Template cadence is mild but present in the climax paragraph ("She closed her eyes, recalling… She focused on… She realized then…"). Figurative language is used throughout without density penalty, but some stock phrasing ("dying light," "heart no longer frozen but blooming with hope") dulls sharpness. Information density is moderate; scaffolding is minimal but present.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 2 and 3 restate "discard assumptions" and "silence is not empty" without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "She smiled faintly... She took a deep breath... She twisted a dial..." runs across paragraph 3–4 (−0.5). Stock metaphors: "skeletal fingers," "thread of light," "heart of the universe" are unearned and muddy the final image. The ending stacks thesis statements instead of propelling through concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "her eyes fixed on the horizon" and "stood at the edge of the dock" restate position without adding detail. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She felt herself stretched thin… she pressed on… she knew her mission was complete." Stock metaphors (kaleidoscope, starlight bathed) and therapy-speak ("her resiliently positive spirit") cluster in peak beats. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed," "she suspected") dull immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, applying −0.6 to −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is high; causality and spatial choreography track cleanly. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "unsettling calm" appears twice without reweighting; "realistically imaginary" is repeated near-verbatim. The final paragraph stacks three summary sentences that paraphrase the same realization. Figurative language is dense—"rivers of color," "roots that coiled upward like living vines," "symphony of rational enchantment"—without muddle, but the clustering in descriptive beats slightly slows momentum. No major artifacts obscure closure, so penalties remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    Recurring template phrases ("the aliens had," "as if," "seemed to") create mild scaffold. Stock metaphors ("compass needle perpetually seeking," "horizons unfolded") cluster in high-concept moments. The final paragraph's "ready to navigate it all" is abstraction without concrete image. Paraphrase loops appear ("wonder, but also uncertainty" / "chaos...solace"). Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty, but many serve only thematic decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several paraphrase loops: "contact tracer for hearts" → "protect vulnerable voices"; "faint pulses" recurs without variation; "incidental heroism" appears twice in near-identical constructions. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she had done what she could," "her incidental heroism a quiet but powerful force," "a reminder that even the faintest pulse…" stack summaries rather than images. Stock metaphors: "mist swirled around her ankles," "clinging to her skin like a second layer of sorrow." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final beat without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying −0.5. No grammar or tense errors, and information density is adequate in the search sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She had returned… driven by a promise… stood by the unremembered." "The facility's decay mirrored her own internal struggle." "She pressed on… she pressed forward." Figurative language is dense but mixed: "corridors choked with silt and secrets," "veins pulsing with something ancient," "threads of light, alive and moving" pile metaphors without cumulative pressure (−0.6). Stock openers ("As she descended," "Suddenly, the room shifted") and abstract intensifiers ("strange phenomena," "something invisible") dull momentum. Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing knowledge or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The ghost was tied to the shard, to the ink, to her very being. It was as if the universe was trying to communicate..." Adjacent sentences restate without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She worked through the night... The observatory's ancient computers whirred... As the defragmentation progressed..." Metaphor density spikes without payoff: "swirling like galaxies," "danced like fireflies," "glistening like a thousand opals" in quick succession. Stock phrases abound: "her heart quickening," "the first light of dawn." These artifacts cluster near closure, dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several template-cadence runs appear: "She was searching… She was no longer… She knew…" Stock metaphors ("jagged teeth," "wings beating in perfect harmony") and synonym loops ("echoes grew louder, each one a fragment of a story, a memory, a plea" followed by "echoes around her began to coalesce, forming words, phrases, entire sentences") reduce propulsion. The phrase "the flawed diamond was indeed cursed" mid-story is expository confirmation rather than discovery. Apply −0.8 for patterned artifacts (template stems, stock metaphor strings, paraphrase loop).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She clutched it tightly" / "Lena clutched the arrowhead"; "The arrowhead pulsed" / "its energy syncing." Template cadence runs through the opening ("its walls lined…its air thick"). Mixed metaphor: "gravitationally playful" applied to dimension-shifting strains physics without a taught rule. Stock phrasing ("her heart pounding," "her mind racing") in peak beats replaces embodied perception. Clarity holds, but density and propulsion are hampered by scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or pronoun ambiguity. However, paraphrase loops and stock phrasing recur: "delicate thread weaving through the silence" / "thread connecting the mechanical world to the beauty it had lost"; "fragile yet persistent" / "fragile space" / "fragile thrum." Template cadence: "She knew... She knew... But she didn't yet understand..." Figurative language saturates without pattern-teaching: "tapestry," "serpents awakened," "beacon of hope" stack without payoff. Sentence openings vary moderately but information density is low; many lines rephrase prior content. Apply −0.8 for loops and stock metaphor strings under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are present: the opening's "flickering weakly" / "shimmered like a forgotten relic" and the ending's "heart heavy with hope and sorrow" / "enough—a reminder" restate mood without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in "he was known for," "he hoped," "he watched," and repeated "Elias [verb]" stems across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors accumulate: "thunderstorm in a bottle," "tempest trapped in amber," "ghostly echo," "brittle hush." Register drifts into literary ornament ("design by linking absences") that clashes with the tactical present. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (arcade clock as metaphor), but scaffold remains ("Since then, he'd fostered hope").

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is mostly clear and fluid with good sensory specificity and rhythm. However, several phrases trend toward stock lyricism: "the weight of his own memories," "heart full with a sense of purpose," "whispering gleam of hope." The climax—"the carousel seemed to respond, its animals shifting ever so slightly"—uses passive observation where active dramatization would raise stakes. "As the song reached its climax" and "when the light faded" are summary transitions that compress the pivotal beat. No major loops or template cadence, but figurative language ("tapestry of forgotten dreams") appears frequently without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate. Minor scaffold appears: "The scarf was her talisman" and "She believed the library held more than words" are expository tells that could be shown through action. The phrase "sanely eccentric" recurs without dramatization. The final beat compresses causality ("When she returned…the patrons were gone") without tracking elapsed time or her passage back through the doorway, creating a small sequence gap.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.1)
    Persistent template cadence: "Her fingers traced," "Her camera was her brush," "Her method was unique." Paraphrase loops abound—"weaver of stories," "collector of moments"; "what was and what could be," "between reality and the dream." Stock metaphors clutter peak beats: "bridge between her world and the one she had lost," "portal," "symphony of secrets." The final paragraph is pure scaffold, summarizing rather than showing. Figurative density in most sentences without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties; mixed vehicle (painting with light via photography) is never clarified on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally high; no major loops or causality breaks. However, template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems across multiple beats, and stock metaphors ("darkness that seemed to pulse with life," "swirling, formless thing") dilute specificity. The final beat summarizes rather than dramatizing the transformation ("everything around her felt different"). Information density is adequate, but figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff. Clean grammar and tense; no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but multiple instances of stock phrasing reduce line-level precision: "her heart pounding with anticipation," "breath caught," "her eyes held a sadness," "the truth was within her grasp." Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She recognized them instantly... She believed the mushrooms were a sign... Her task now was to detect..." The phrase "decades later" is used twice in different paragraphs without clear temporal anchoring, creating mild confusion. Figurative language in "shipwrecks casting long shadows" and "nostalgia that tugged at her heart" functions adequately but leans toward familiar constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Figurative density is high throughout ("dust motes danced," "steam curling like whispers," "scars badges of honor," "river breaking through a dam") without pattern-teaching or payoff—register drifts into poetic ornament that slows momentum. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "shard-mirror before her was no ordinary artifact. Its surface held the trapped shadow…its edges frayed" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences. Template cadence in final paragraph: "She had not just annotated…she had given…" stacks parallel constructions. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering artifact cap; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops recur: "weaver between worlds, a guardian of the unseen threads" restates the same idea; "she was more than a pruner, more than a weaver" recycles structure from the opening without new information. Template cadence runs through multiple "she [verb]" stems ("She moved," "She closed," "She had spent"). Stock metaphors ("bridge, a vessel," "lullaby of continuity") and synonym churn ("essence" appears six times, "radiant hush" four) dull momentum. Figurative density in peak beats (planting ritual) obscures causal progression without taught pattern or payoff. Apply −1.2 for loops and template artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is moderate—some sentences double-job (e.g., needle glinting while Elara studies the knot), but others restate ("accumulated silence" appears three times, "restless" recurs without added pressure). Paraphrase loops are minimal but present: "silence accumulated" / "accumulated silence pressing heavier" / "accumulated silence had been lifted" cycles the same concept. Template cadence in the middle section ("She pressed... She closed... She knew...") flattens propulsion slightly. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("bridge between worlds," "prism of light on her path"), though "tapestry needle... glinted" and "sharp tip ready to sever threads of time" lean decorative in a high-pressure beat. No major artifact touching closure; deductions remain within non-closure range.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispered of a chapel lost to time" / "whispered chapel, as it was called in ancient texts"; "her methodically curious nature drew her" / "Her methodical curiosity led her to wonder." Template cadence runs across adjacent sentences: "Her gaze shifted… Her methodical curiosity led… Her empathy guided…" Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "like the rings of a tree," "like a puzzle solver," "like a detective." The final paragraph stacks abstract noun phrases ("the power of curiosity and empathy," "a bridge between the past and the present") that replace concrete image. Apply scaffold and loop penalty −1.0; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. No paraphrase loops, scaffold sentences, or template cadence runs. Sentence openings vary and figurative language (snow globe as key, library as tomb/lullaby) serves purpose without muddle. Minor deduction for a few stock constructions: "quiet reminder of something she couldn't quite name" and "strange clarity" are generic placeholders that could be more sensorily specific. Opening and closing lines anchor well.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is generally clear but carries ornamental density without corresponding pressure. Phrases like "a song for the unseen, the unheard, and the yet to be" and "its essence scattered like stardust on the wind" layer figurative language in the final beats without adding causal information. Minor template cadence: "It was a phantom… It was an odd relic…" opens consecutive expository blocks. No major loops or artifacts touch closure, capping deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "unfolded" recurs (map, clock face, drawer, diary, elevator doors) without pattern payoff or varied meaning. Template cadence is evident—"She [verb], [gerund]" structures repeat across beats. Stock metaphors cluster: "heart quickening," "resolve strengthening," "warmly inquisitive," "heart alight." The final paragraph stacks four abstract assertions in succession without concrete image or action, flattening the closure beat. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor −0.3, closure-beat summary −0.4) yields a baseline around 4.9 with −1.5 total non-closure debt.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks create visual pace. However, several line-level issues accumulate: figurative density is high without consistent payoff ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness," "dusty starlight" recur as atmosphere rather than functional metaphor), and some constructions loop or stack near-synonyms ("the glowing cumulus was closer now, its light spilling… illuminating… with an otherworldly glow"). Template cadence appears in the vision paragraph ("laughter, tears, moments of joy and sorrow" / "a thread in the tapestry of existence"). The final paragraph paraphrases the opening thesis without added pressure. Clarity is maintained, but density and momentum slip under ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Paraphrase loops appear: "The building groaned softly, as if sensing its impending demise" echoes the opening's "silence that precedes an ending," and "her hands trembling despite her resolve" / "her heart pounding" recycle interiority without new pressure. Template cadence in the opening ("It was a stillness... Her fingers traced... Her eyes... saw... Her gift... had led her") clusters three "Her [noun] [verb]" stems without taught pattern. The figurative load is managed but occasionally stacks ("living relic amidst the decay," "crafting beauty from chaos") without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but carries noticeable template cadence: "her fingers tracing," "her quill hovered," "her hand moving," "her notebook clutched" across multiple beats. Figurative language is sparse but the stock phrase "sociable isolation" appears twice without dramatization. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., the phrasebook introduction) but others loop conceptually (the hopscotch board is "peculiar" then "said to hold the key" in adjacent lines). No major loops or artifacts obscure causality, but rhythmic variety and propulsion are limited. The opening and closing images are competent but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs mar momentum: "The air was thick…The air inside was colder"; "she saw herself…She saw herself…And she saw herself" (three-sentence parallelism without taught pattern); "her hands trembled…her breath visible…her heart pounded" (stock embodiment markers). Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats: "words shifting like shadows," "distilled into this place," "hummed with a quiet energy." Filter-verb stacks appear ("she noticed," "she realized," "she saw") without voice motivation, reducing immediacy. Apply baseline artifact penalty −0.8 for loops and cadence, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density, totaling −1.1. Rounding: 6.5 baseline minus 1.1 = 5.4.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.9)
    Opening paragraph front-loads metaphor—"brambled hope," "fragile blossom," "ancient guardians"—without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure. Paraphrase loops: "her motivation was clear" followed by a colon restating the motivation; "the butterfly garden was a forgotten sanctuary, overgrown...its center stood the bell...had not rung in decades" chains exposition without propulsion. Template cadence in the gathering sequence: "Mira discovered...Jorin remembered...Lira's songs seemed." Synonym churn: "glided," "shimmering," "pulsing," "resonant," "iridescent" stack without clear stakes. The final paragraph's "strangers who had become family stood united, their hope no longer brambled but blooming" is a thematic echo that summarizes rather than charges. Artifacts touch closure, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ global cap.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "hush" appears eight times, "beautifully flawed" thrice, "nested patterns" and "lullaby" recur without evolving meaning. Template cadence in para 2: "The lighthouse was… Yet tonight… Elara's hands moved…" Stock metaphors ("like a sentinel," "like a blade of hope") and elevated register ("vouchsafe," "encroaching," "achingly fragile") clash with urgency. Filter-verb stack in para 3 ("saw herself," "feeling," "let it drip") dulls immediacy. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching. Information density is low—many lines restate mood. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("beautifully flawed" in final para), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 at 8.7; pervasive loops and template stems trigger −1.4 in Q7 plus −0.3 for paraphrase adjacency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Its surface was offhandedly exact, each line precise yet organic" is immediately restated as "as if it had been carved by a hand that knew exactly what it was doing without trying too hard." The phrase "forgotten blueprint" recurs three times, twice in the same paragraph, without new pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "fractured spine," "glinting in the fading light," "wings whirred like broken gears." The final paragraph summarizes the arc ("something had changed") rather than letting the bud image close, dulling propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock strings; no closure-beat harm, so cap at that deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "separation was not an end, but a step" is immediately echoed by "she needed to apply that principle to her own life," and "the world felt different—not perfect, but whole" restates the prior paragraph's thesis. Template cadence appears in the opening ("She was a polymer chemist... Yet, here... she sought") and recurs throughout. Figurative language ("whisper from the universe," "weave the threads of her life") stacks without adding pressure. The −0.8 accumulation for loops, scaffold, and stock metaphor strings lowers the score; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops in paragraph three ("This was no ordinary library; it was a repository of narratives in flux, a place where beginnings and endings blurred") and five ("The story it contained was not yet written; it was hers to craft") reduce density. Template cadence: "She believed… She knew… She placed…" across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "hold its breath") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "knew instinctively") dull immediacy in peak moments. The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than trusting the image. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is adequate and sentences mostly advance. However, the piece exhibits template cadence ("She was no ordinary chef," "She knew," "She reached out"), stock metaphors ("mirage," "labyrinth"), and paraphrase loops (the pavilion's beauty and danger are restated without added pressure). The final paragraph's explain-everything summary ("for remorse was eternal, but for now, it was gone") flattens momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always purposeful; "sturdy brittle" as tone descriptor is vague. No single artifact obscures closure, but accumulated minor issues prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Syntax varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop conceptually: the silo/bridge metaphor is restated three times without added pressure. "Borrowed starlight" appears as a repeated phrase without evolving meaning. Template cadence surfaces in the final paragraph: "her voice, and her home" / "the next song, the next bridge to build" / "a promise... where silos no longer stood, but bridges stretched." Filter verbs ("began to sing," "began to turn," "began to hum") stack in the middle section, dulling immediacy. No clarity break at closure, but momentum sags under decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images land ("jagged edges glinted under the lunar glow"). However, paraphrase loops recur: "memories once reflected—memories now entangled," "scattered remnants...each piece a memory waiting to be reassembled," and "dreams she had once pursued—dreams of colonizing Mars." Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "she was" constructions. Information density is uneven; the middle section recounts backstory without advancing present pressure. "Quaking reverie" appears twice as a stock phrase without fresh context.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high. No major loops or synonym churn. However, multiple phrases lean toward stock figurative language: "kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge," "as if the very earth held its breath," "heart pounding with a mix of fear and excitement." Figurative density in the opening paragraph (serpentine, prism-minded, clandestine, latent blaze) stacks modifiers without clear pattern or payoff. The phrase "her heart alight with a latent blaze" in the final paragraph nearly duplicates the opening's "latent blaze," reducing propulsion. Information density is moderate; some beats narrate micro-movements (wading, clutching, drifting) that do not advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "Her method was unique… Her mind was symphonically minded… Her motivation was pure" echoes label-only exposition. The final paragraph contains thematic summary—"music hidden in silence… a symphony of resilience and beauty"—that replaces scene pressure. Figurative language ("whispered secrets," "conducting an orchestra of shadows") appears in most high-pressure beats without variation, and "empathy in motion" recurs as an ungrounded phrase. Template cadence in the opening third ("Her tools were simple… Her work was not about… Her latest project was") adds −0.4; paraphrase loops and thematic tell in the closure beat add −0.6, total −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the difficult was not an obstacle but a canvas" / "to discover beauty in the difficult" recycle the same concept across paragraphs. The final third stacks filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt," "she knew") and abstract summaries that tell rather than show peak realizations. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions: "not a punishment but a chance," "not as an exile, but as a guide," "not a failure but a lesson." These patterns cluster near closure, applying the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per rubric. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere without altering stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "shadowed workshop under the stars" appears three times; "the path to empathy" and "varieties of silence" recur without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third ("She felt," "She realized," "She had recovered," "She stood"). Figurative language clusters without purpose: "air seemed to hold its breath," "shadows danced like old friends," "stars appeared to shine brighter." Filter-verb stack ("seemed," "felt," "appeared") in the closure paragraphs dulls immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes, flattening momentum at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound with purposeful sensory detail. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the air shifted" immediately followed by "emitted a faint, earthy aroma"; "her ambition...had kept her from truly embracing the present" restates the serenity-versus-motion tension without added pressure. Template cadence: "She decided to journalize... She watered it... She closed her eyes" chains subject-verb stems across the middle. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddles; information density is moderate. Apply paraphrase-loop check (−0.2) and template-cadence penalty (−0.4), totaling −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies, but several beats loop without adding pressure: "The orchard planet was unlike any other" restates what the opening already showed, and "Elara's heart raced; this was the source of resilience she'd been seeking" tells emotion and plot rather than advancing either. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs three times, twice as ornament. Figurative language ("shimmered like stars," "chorus of whispers") leans stock. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("she had discovered," "she knew," "she would protect") that deflate the closure image rather than letting it resonate. Information density is moderate; beats often do two jobs (describe and advance), but scaffold phrasing ("Her mission was clear," "she realized") reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; the opening establishes atmosphere effectively. However, multiple phrases loop thematically without advancing pressure: "singular convergence" appears twice, "hazy precision" bookends, and "cultivate foresight in action" is restated in the final paragraph. The phrase "her rapidly adapting mind" is a filter-heavy label rather than an embodied process. Template stems recur ("she moved," "she found," "she knelt") across beats without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple prose artifacts drag momentum: "sculpted hush," "prism-song bell ringer," "oscillating repose" are stock-elevated compounds repeated without earned meaning; "Her mission was clear" is scaffolding; the final paragraph loops theme statements ("unfetter more than just the sculpted hush—she had unfettered hope"). Paragraph three paraphrases the village backstory without advancing present pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the hush take shape," "felt silence as shape") dull immediacy in a key beat. Sentence stems repeat: "The [noun] was [metaphor]" structure runs through multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with moderate information density. Several paraphrase loops appear: "canyon hush" recurs four times with synonym variants ("silence so profound it felt alive," "eerily still"); "driven relic keeper" and related phrases loop. Template cadence in paragraph three: "She had sworn...to learn...the gilded reed flute was her next step" stacks purpose statements. Mixed metaphor: "avalanchingly quiet" contradicts itself. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt") appear frequently but within tolerance. Opening and closing lines lack sharp propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries clarity and momentum through the first two-thirds, but the final third collapses into paraphrase loops ("felt changed," "resonated deep within his core," "felt alive in a way it never had before") and stock metaphor strings ("tapestry," "labyrinth of mirrors," "chamber within him"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax beat without pattern-teaching or payoff: "chorus of voices," "complex tapestry," "expanding boundaries." Template cadence runs ("He felt," "He realized," "He knew") across three consecutive sentences trigger additional deduction. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.0 for spread across closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clean with no typos or grammar breaks. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates adequately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the pendant's hum" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Filter-verb reliance ("She thought," "She felt") softens immediacy in several beats. Stock metaphors ("living tapestry," "spirits") appear without transformation. Information density is moderate; no major scaffolding but some lines restate without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ. Clarity is consistent, and figurative language (mist thickening, shadows clinging) serves atmosphere without obscuring action. Minor filter-verb stacks in the communion paragraph ("she felt it," "she realized") dull immediacy slightly. One paraphrase loop: "faint resonance, like a whisper" followed by "slowly, she felt it—a faint resonance" restates without added pressure. The timeframe phrase "when assumptions shatter" reads as decorative philosophy rather than concrete temporal anchor. No major template cadence or register drift; information density is adequate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "wistful...though she did not yet know" echoes "wondered...though its secrets remained locked"; "her only companion was a tree sap amber bead...a gift from her grandmother" restates the bead's identity across beats. Template cadence in final third: "Every step felt," "she felt the weight," "As she walked, she felt." Stock metaphor strings ("liquid gold," "fabric of time," "tapestry of time") cluster without fresh vehicle. Register drift into prompt-echo phrasing ("latent sacrifice," "raveling silence") at closure. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock strings −0.4, closure-beat artifact escalation −0.6. Cap at 4.9 due to artifacts in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence openings show some variety, but several beats recycle scaffold: "The air was thick," "The ground trembled," "a surge of energy coursed." Paraphrase loop in paragraph one: "quietly determined" / "fragile hope" / "sought resilience" restate resolve without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: arches "like jagged teeth" later "hum with life"—teeth don't hum. Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("moved," "pressed on," "Unfurling") dulls immediacy. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent; line-level clarity holds but lacks propulsion in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but carries noticeable scaffolding: "As she lifted it, the world around her seemed to shimmer" and "As she moved deeper" repeat the weak "as" opener. Synonym churn appears in "weave," "weaving," "weave between," and repeated "map" language without variation in function. The final paragraph stacks summary beats ("no longer just," "not just… but," "just beginning") that explain rather than propel. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") dull immediacy in key moments, and the closure image is abstract ("threads," "balance") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but several loops and scaffolds appear: "sea glass" mentioned five times, "protect the light" repeated verbatim, and the final paragraph restates the entire premise in summary ("The lighthouse wasn't just a beacon; it was a guardian, and so was he"). The phrase "luminescent ache" is used twice with minimal reweighting. Stock metaphors ("anchor," "beacon," "guardian") cluster in the ending without fresh embodiment. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs, but the final third recaps rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops: "The Herald's laughter grew louder" / "laughter carried an edge" / "laughter faltered" / "laughter returned" / "laughter grew louder" recycles the same beat across five iterations without new pressure (−0.4). Template cadence: "They knew... / They understood. / They knew what they had to do" stacks identical stems in the climactic sequence (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "sword of light" and "battle cry against the unknown" are generic high-register phrases. Figurative density in the fog passage ("shapes moved—shapes that should not exist," "swirling light," "deep, ethereal green") blurs specificity without pattern-teaching. Sentence rhythm is serviceable but lacks propulsion; many lines do one job only.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and carries atmospheric detail, but momentum suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing. "His mind was quietly explosive, churning with questions" immediately follows abstract declaration of his gift. Template cadence appears: "He sat... He closed... He saw... He focused... He approached." Stock metaphors (storm of story, threads glowing) and therapy-speak ("loss and resilience," "struggles have meaning") dull peak beats. The final paragraph summarizes purpose rather than showing embodied action, and "the blue morpho wing in his hand" is repeated twice in three sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The sextant was more than a tool; it was a key" followed immediately by "the sextant guided him differently" and "The sextant wasn't just broken; it was a vessel." Template cadence runs appear ("each corridor a fragment," "each piece he removed revealed a fragment"). Stock metaphors ("the shadow of the stormlit tower," "the soft hum of dreams") lack fresh propulsion. Baseline −0.8 for paraphrase/template patterns; an additional −0.3 for therapy-adjacent abstraction ("sorrow quantified," "resilience of the human spirit") that flattens concreteness in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    Clarity is maintained, and the prose moves without major opacity. Multiple paraphrase loops weaken density: "answer lay in the forgotten songs" / "songs had been lost"; "mirror world whispered to her" / "urging her to remember"; "no longer a tomb but a cradle" / "ready to birth a new era." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("her hands steady, her purpose fulfilled") and stock metaphor strings ("threads weaving a tapestry of light") dull the closure image. Filter-verb reliance ("felt a surge," "felt the pull") reduces immediacy in peak beats. Artifacts touch the final third; baseline −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening anchors are clear. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: paragraph four's "The more she learned, the more she realized" and "hiding her true self" / "staying while leaving" restate the same idea. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" recurs (paragraphs three and five) without evolving pressure. Template stems appear in paragraph five: "On a pedestal lay... Thaddeus appeared... This, he said..." The final paragraph stacks summary: "decided," "felt," "knowing," "had become"—four abstractions in three sentences that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, but information density is low: multiple sentences restate Elara's mission without advancing pressure ("Her method was as unconventional as her quest: guerrilla gardening" adjacent to "Her actions were heuristically gentle"). Template cadence appears in the opening ("a reminder that," "a woman who") and in the closing ("they were all pieces," "a reminder that"). Stock metaphors ("canvas for renewal," "ritual of restoration") and summary blocks ("As she ate, her mind wandered") slow momentum without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Rhythm varies across paragraphs. However, several issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("not just to preserve but to connect, to conjure meaning from fragments"), template cadence in paragraph eight ("sampling frequencies…uncovering hidden patterns…weaving together stories"), and stock metaphors ("edge of oblivion," "heart alight"). The phrase "quartz hush" recurs without reweighting. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") stack in paragraphs four and six, dulling immediacy at key beats. Applying the loop and artifact penalties: −0.6 for template runs and synonym churn, −0.4 for filter-verb clusters = baseline penalty −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high in the opening and market navigation. Minor scaffold: "Her heart quickened. This was it." is a textbook beat. The phrase "she'd thwarted the thieves, not with force, but with words and wit" tells rather than dramatizes the key turn. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She closed her hand... feeling its weight one last time. The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one..." The closure beat leans on summary rather than image-driven propulsion. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but the final third loses momentum to reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences vary in structure and the piece avoids major loops. However, several phrases lean on scaffold: "paradox that defined her very being," "shrouded in mystery," "a longing for a time she had never known yet felt deeply connected to." The metallic/sweet taste mechanism is clear and propulsive. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere but the final third summarizes rather than dramatizes the key turn. Template stems appear ("It was here that," "She had always been") but do not pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "The cave was silent… It was a silence… And in this moment, she saw herself clearly." Figurative language clusters without payoff: "chains," "cage," "womb," "liberation," "declaration" stack in the final third without fresh embodiment. The phrase "auroral sorrow" reads as thesaurus-driven ornament. The repeated line "After the last echo of laughter fades" functions structurally but its origin and literal meaning remain unclear, creating minor opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean with no major grammatical errors. Several stock metaphors appear: "weight of silence," "seeds of truth," "bridge between past and present." A paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "her art wilted near dishonesty, the gilded leaves curling and browning at the slightest hint of deceit" restates the gift's mechanic already established. The climax beat ("She realized then") summarizes rather than dramatizes. Sentence openings vary adequately, but information density is diluted by scaffold phrases ("She knew the journey ahead would be difficult").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her task was not merely to tune bells but to capture the essence of truth" is restated in varied terms across three paragraphs. Template cadence: "She felt... She knew... She looked..." structures multiple beats. Stock metaphors cluster in the opening third ("earth kissed the heavens," "clouds draped like a soft, gray blanket"). Figurative density in non-pressured beats triggers −0.6; loops and stems add −0.5; total −1.1 from a mid-5s base.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is solid ("the box of childhood fears, a relic Elara had discovered years ago but never opened"). Minor paraphrase loop: "She was still the caretaker, still strangely organic, still a being of fragmented wholeness" recycles the same structure and content from earlier without new pressure. "Strangely organic" appears five times, often decoratively. No significant clarity issues or template cadence; the prose propels without major scaffolding. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she had always been motivated by the stories behind objects, but this felt personal" restates the opening's "knack for uncovering stories hidden within forgotten objects." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she realized then... she had found... she had found..." Stock metaphors—"heart quickened," "voice barely above a whisper," "sandstorm calm"—flatten peak beats. Minimal −0.6 deduction for loops and stock phrasing; the closure beat is not obscured but lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "to liberate the knowledge buried here, to free it from the clutches of obscurity" and "She was not here to mourn the past but to resurrect it, to breathe life into the echoes" are synonym pairs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("breadcrumbs in a forest," "beacon in the darkness," "as a spider spins its web") appear in multiple sentences without fresh specificity. Template cadence runs: "Her fingers brushed… She carried… She worked… She moved…" across adjacent paragraphs. The closure paragraph stacks abstraction ("symbol of loss," "secrets liberated," "wisdom shared") instead of concrete image, dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The wildflowers, he believed, held a clue—a pattern he couldn't yet decipher" / "pattern he had deciphered from the coffee grounds" recycles the motif without advancing pressure. Template cadence in final paragraph: "The wildflowers, the whale, the coffee grounds—they had all been..." Stock metaphors ("slipped through his mind like sand," "floating like fragments of light") dull specificity. Baseline −0.8 in Q7 for loops and stock phrasing touching the closure beat. Sentence openings vary; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across multiple beats: "The haven fell into an even deeper quiet, the brook's gurgle now a distant memory" restates the prior paragraph's "pause" without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the climax: "weaving threads of moonlight," "mist in her mind," "trapped animal." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the ritual sequence without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. Sentences often do more than one job, but scaffold phrases ("she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy. The final paragraph stacks summary and abstraction, flattening the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence rhythm and no major loops or scaffold. Some minor redundancy: "a language you've forgotten you once knew" and later "dead languages" echo the same concept without new pressure. The "strange familiarity, as though they had spoken before in a dream" and "his smile faint but genuine" lean toward stock phrasing. Filter-verb use ("felt a twinge of shame," "felt a chill") is light and voice-motivated. Information density is moderate; the lecture section advances theme but stalls plot momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    Multiple line-level artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop in paragraph one: "drawn to the garden…by the whispers" and "the garden itself was urging her closer" restate the same pull. Template cadence in paragraph five: "She saw…she saw…she saw" and "the child's laughter become…the woman's tears turn…the man's solitude transform" create mechanical parallelism. Stock metaphors pervade ("sea of light and shadow," "pierced her heart," "soft breeze that carried the promise"). Register drift occurs when the narrator names "quarantined memories" and "resonance structures"—terms outside Elara's interiority that read like prompt elements inserted rather than discovered. The final paragraph's summary ("Her skepticism had been charmed…her isolation into independence") tells the arc rather than anchoring it in a concrete image, and the garden "whisper[ing] its gratitude" anthropomorphizes without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. The aurora/stalactite imagery is vivid and advances atmosphere. However, several lines loop or restate: "to unlink the threads of truth" is echoed by "unlink the words," "unlink the hurt," and "unlinked herself from the pain"—synonym churn on the core concept. "Forgive the unfinished" appears twice without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("time moves on, but the heart can choose how to endure") rather than trusting the image. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a weight lift," "felt alive") are present but not clustered enough to trigger the −0.5 penalty. Slight density loss from ornamental phrasing ("heritage rose thorn," "calibrated treason") that front-loads concept without scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "richly perceptive mind sifting through layers of sound and shadow" and "webs of intrigue began to unravel" stack metaphors without clarity (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "The air was thick with... ancient secrets" / "ground... pulsed with the rhythm of the cosmos" restate mood without advancing action. Scaffold phrases recur: "her voice rising," "her hand tightening," "she stood firm." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("The universe hummed... Elara sang along... her melody") flattens propulsion (−0.6 cumulative in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.1)
    Repetitive sentence stems and synonym loops appear throughout: "The shrine was…," "Elara placed…," "Elara held…" across adjacent paragraphs; "the globe seemed to glow" echoes "the shrine seemed to come alive." Stock metaphors (tapestry woven from fragments, window of connection, borrowed starlight) and filter-verb stacks ("she sensed," "she focused," "she whispered") dull immediacy. Information density is low; beats often restate atmosphere without advancing causality. The paraphrase loop and template cadence penalties (−0.6 cumulative) apply here, and the artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, but multiple sentences loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "to appreciate hidden effort" recurs almost verbatim across paragraphs; "hidden patterns" and "unseen" are restated in synonyms. Template cadence appears in the opening of several paragraphs ("Elara's presence," "Elara's tone," "Elara's journey"). Figurative density is high ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "symphony of effort," "tapestry of existence") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental texture that slows momentum. The final paragraph summarizes rather than closing with a concrete image, applying −0.6 for loop and scaffold artifacts plus −0.3 for register drift into abstract philosophizing in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "sharply observant eye" (para 1), "sharply observant mind" (para 3), "sharply observant nature" (para 7). Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five sentences in the climax sequence. Stock metaphor: "her chant becoming a scream" without specificity. The final paragraph recycles the opening's "excavate truth" phrasing verbatim. Information density is low; beats often repeat the same content.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings vary and rhythm shifts with pressure (short bursts during activation, longer reflection after). However, paraphrase loops weaken density: "The observatory... was his sanctuary—a place where the world's chaos felt distant, yet its pulse remained tangible" restates the same idea. Template cadence in "He saw cities crumbling, new societies rising" and "not just of the future, but of the past" flattens propulsion. Stock metaphors ("bridge between worlds," "heart pounding," "trembling hands") cluster in peak beats without fresh specificity. Figurative language ("surface rippling like water," "cascade of energy") appears in most climax sentences without pattern-teaching, triggering density and coherence concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative language clusters heavily in opening and closing beats without pattern-teaching: "wind whispered secrets," "lonesome splendor," "sounds held memories," "melody danced inside, shimmering like captured light." Mixed metaphors are avoided, but density triggers the overwriting deduction (−0.5). Template-cadence runs appear: "He was no longer just... he was..." and "ready to listen, ready to translate, ready to sweeten" (parallelism escalates into list). Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "capturing sounds" restated as "sounds held memories" without added detail. Information density is moderate; some lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously, but scaffolding remains ("His motivation was clear"). Apply cumulative artifact penalty: density −0.5, template cadence −0.4, minor loop −0.2 = ~−1.1 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences: "She was the guardian…her true purpose ran deeper" / "She had sworn to protect it, her motivation rooted in…" restates the same commitment without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs through the confrontation: "She had to adapt…She took a deep breath…She realized the truth…" (−0.4). Stock metaphors cluster in the opening ("dying embers," "ancient secrets," "sacred artifact") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.3). Figurative language in most sentences of the climax ("air shimmered," "discordant note in the symphony") without earned specificity (−0.5). Total artifact debt and loops exceed −1.0 baseline; cumulative cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: "Her motivation was clear" echoed by "With this realization, Elara's actions became more focused"; "track the moon paths" repeated without variation. Template cadence appears in the paragraph beginning "One evening": "She closed her eyes... In that moment, she understood." Stock metaphors ("the ground itself was a canvas," "planting seeds") accumulate without fresh angle. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structures. Some minor loops appear: "echoes" and "reverberate" recur without pattern-teaching or payoff transformation; "calm" is stated multiple times without embodied variation. "Fortified vulnerability" and "reverberation of the truth" feel like elevated abstractions rather than concrete perceptions. The final paragraph layers declarations—"her weapon," "her shield," "a force"—that summarize rather than propel. No major artifacts obscure causality, but density and propulsion sag in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and paragraph structure supports emotional beats. Information density is moderate: many lines advance theme or atmosphere but some redundancy appears ("He had come here to turn an apology into action—an apology not just to Thomas, but to himself" unpacks what was already implicit). The phrase "vibrant hush" recurs without functional variation. Minor template cadence in the opening: "He had come…He had asked…He had spent…He had come." Stock metaphor at closure: "storm" and "calm before" echo the timeframe prompt rather than feeling character-generated. No major loops or artifacts obscure causality, and the prose remains clear throughout. One paraphrase slip: "relief washing over him" followed immediately by "a shift within him" restates emotional change. Figurative language is controlled and does not muddle peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("iridescent hue, like the acid sea at dawn"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The workshop seemed to hold its breath as the machine whirred faster, the gears and cogs clicking in unison" closely echoes prior mechanical descriptions. Template cadence runs in the opening ("a pioneering cart glider… a marvel of clanking metal… a place where") and final paragraph ("the acid sea churned below, the gears and cogs whirred above, and the world evolved around her"). Filter verbs cluster in key beats ("seemed to hold," "seemed to vibrate"), dulling immediacy. These patterns apply −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "the recurring numbers began appearing everywhere" is restated as "They showed up in timestamps, user IDs, even the archive's metadata"; "sensed absence, a void in the data" is echoed as "The sensed absence wasn't just in the data—it was in the company's silence." Template cadence in the middle section: "She pulled up the song... She dug further... She decided to lie... She replayed the file." Information density is moderate but momentum stalls in the exposition-heavy final third. No figurative muddle, but no rhythmic control under pressure either; syntax remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally good; sentence openings vary. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "a time long past, a time when courage was not just an act but a way of being" restates itself without adding pressure. "She saw not her own reflection but a glimpse" is clean, but "this was not just a story; it was a blueprint" summarizes rather than shows. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "shadow-laced," "weighted breath," "pulse of the world," "rippled like water" cluster without cumulative payoff. The reconstitution sequence ("rose from their corners, drawn by an unseen force, fitting together with a soft chime") reads passive and abstract where embodied detail would sharpen impact. Minor scaffold and mixed register cumulatively lower to mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong imagery: "broken teeth," "skeletons in a graveyard," "ice seemed to pulse." However, thematic phrases recur without functional pressure: "fold in patience" appears twice, "windborne solace" twice, "gripping reality loosely" twice, "sound of approaching endings" three times. The final paragraph loops concepts already stated, reducing information density. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the closure beat summarizes rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean and grammatically sound, with varied sentence structure and no major loops or scaffolding. However, several beats recycle the same thematic content: the paragraph beginning "She sat on a wooden bench" and the one starting "With a gentle touch" both restate Elara's focus on mismatches without advancing pressure. Figurative language ("amber light seemed to whisper encouragement," "vineyard seemed to hum with quiet life") leans decorative rather than propulsive. Minor paraphrase loop (−0.2) and elevated diction in peak reflective beats (−0.3) apply, capping the score below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade key beats: "preserve the echo of wisdom" recurs four times without reweighting; "whisperfield calm" and "kinetic parapet" are repeated as mantras rather than charged reprises. Template cadence runs dominate: "She knew... She paused... She knelt... She stood... She closed... She turned... She felt." Figurative language clusters without payoff—"testament," "essence," "beacon," "tapestry"—creating density without propulsion. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("fulfillment," "motivation crystallizing," "testament") that summarize rather than image the closure moment. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings in peak beats): baseline −1.2 in Q7; additionally, these artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ global rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean but laden with stock phrases: "time's relentless march," "balm to the wounds of the past," "quiet hope," "earnest whimsy." Paraphrase loops appear ("honor the lives lived and lost" / "honoring... lives lived and lost within those walls"). Template cadence in opening: "Her task was... Her... demeanor allowed... Her focus was..." Figurative language is frequent but often generic ("stream she could wade through," "testament to resilience"). Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing action or deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "the crystal was sonically reflective, capturing whispers" is immediately followed by "a phenomenon he had spent years studying" (scaffolding); "he had witnessed the decline" / "the erosion of stories" restates the same idea; "triumph and sorrow, a bittersweet victory" is redundant. Template cadence: "He adjusted... leaned... began to testify... scribbled" runs through sequential actions without momentum gain. These artifacts dull the closure's charge slightly (−0.6 baseline, touching final third adds −0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with no major grammar or punctuation errors. However, several paraphrase loops and near-duplicates appear: "a sound he could not yet name" / "a whisper he feared was slipping away"; "always reaching for something just out of grasp" / "chasing echoes instead of living"; "clinging to echoes" recurs three times without functional difference. Figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("mind a sieve for the present but a prism for the future"). The final beat avoids scaffold, and information density is adequate, keeping this in mid-6s despite loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening anchors ("lunar observatory above the clouds") and purposeful sentence modulation. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "the clock hand was not just malfunctioning—it was a manifestation" restates the same idea across adjacent lines; "not a malfunction; it was a call to restructure" reprises the pattern. Figurative density is high throughout ("luminous ache," "spiraling out of control," "dance of surrender") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. The all-night work sequence—"She worked through the night"—summarizes the climactic beat rather than dramatizing it with concrete action and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence structure and purposeful sensory detail. However, several lines loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "the scent of hope lingered" appears twice, "pulsing stillness" is repeated, and "hymning the mundane" recurs as a label rather than dramatized action. Stock metaphors ("thread of reconciliation," "air carried the scent of hope") and elevated diction in peak beats ("radiant haven's glow," "flawless goodbye") reduce immediacy. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("knowing she had helped execute... to hymning... to reunify... to let") stacks parallel infinitives mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, with no major loops or artifacts. However, runs of identical sentence stems in the opening ("Elara's fingers traced… This key… Her motivation… Elara's approach…") create template cadence that slightly dulls momentum (−0.4). Information density is adequate but not high; several beats paraphrase without added pressure ("the key in her pocket glowed brighter, as if approving her progress" restates prior content). The final paragraph summarizes rather than charging the image with concrete sensory weight. Overall functional but lacking the propulsion and texture required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean with no major grammar or syntax errors. Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is frequent but controlled (enamel "catching the light like a fragment of moon," hair "shimmered like spun silver"). However, several lines lean toward purple ("bones were being reset," "spirit renewed") and the phrase "nostalgic innovation" in the final line reads as concept-first rather than image-first. Minor paraphrase loop: "healing herself" appears twice in close succession in the penultimate paragraph. Information density is moderate; the maze passage and fountain encounter could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm and vivid imagery ("the heavens above shimmering like a thousand eyes"). Yet several lines loop or paraphrase: "The mist followed her, wrapping around her like a cloak" echoes earlier "mist…wrapping around her like a cocoon." Figurative density is high—nearly every paragraph features metaphor or simile—without always advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstract phrases ("zephyr bloom," "quiet force") that blur rather than sharpen the image. Template stems appear: "She had been…," "She had sworn…," "She called it…"

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice and setting cleanly. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "honeyed hush" is defined twice in close succession, and "watchful dreamer" / "quietly proactive" feel like label toggles rather than dramatized traits. The prose stack "soft and emerald, its tendrils creeping" and "dappled patterns…delicate latticework" leans decorative in the opening beat without immediate pressure. Filter verbs ("felt stripped bare," "craved a space") and therapy-speak ("vulnerability was protected, healing could unfold") appear in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. No major artifact touches the closure beat, keeping the score in the low-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "the whispers grew louder... longing, despair, triumph, and resignation" repeats conceptually across beats; "conflicted nature" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She paused... She closed her eyes... She felt..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("wrapped around her like a shawl," "flow like a river") and therapy-speak ("her fear of failure, her doubt") in peak beats reduce specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her words flowing like a river"), triggering the elevated penalty (−1.0 baseline, −0.3 additional for closure contamination).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, and sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear across adjacent beats: the second paragraph restates the tendril's glow and Elara's study without new information, and the final two paragraphs recycle "stories" and "sacred practices" in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs dominate high-pressure moments ("She hummed... her fingers tracing... The tendril shimmered"), applying a −0.4 deduction. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "Her hands moved deliberately" / "her fingers...demonstrated patience physically"; "safekept starlight" repeated five times without evolving function; "pattern" used eleven times. Template cadence runs plague the middle: "Each piece was chosen..." / "Each person's rhythm was unique..." Figurative language stacks without coherence: "moving stillness," "world...holding its breath," "thick with moving stillness." Stock metaphors ("ghostly moon," "living map") and passive constructions ("was no ordinary substance") dull propulsion. The prose reads like a checklist rather than rhythmically controlled narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, the prose carries template-cadence runs: "Days turned into nights, and nights blurred into days," "It was warm, like sunlight on skin, and fragile, like the first snowflake of winter." Paragraph structure varies but several blocks paraphrase without adding pressure—paragraphs 2 and 4 restate the harvest-of-echoes concept and Elias's motivation with synonym churn ("promise," "way to hold onto," "store wonder") rather than advancing situation. The breakthrough paragraph ("One evening...") delivers information efficiently but leans on "with trembling hands" and "alive once more" as stock embodiment. Figurative density in the final two paragraphs ("air shimmered with the presence of echoes," "warm, like sunlight") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure cost. Apply template-cadence and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 baseline, escalated to −0.9 for artifact spread across closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice and setting efficiently. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or concept. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "to carry what others cannot, to lighten their load" restates the same idea; "her mind reaching out like a spider's web, catching the threads" is metaphorically apt but the "threads" recur without escalation. Stock phrases cluster in the dialogue ("Purpose can be a trap," "understanding begins with myself"). The final paragraph's "fractal map of her own soul, her own burdens, her own shingled hush" lists rather than propels. No major artifacts obscure causality, but minor redundancy and elevated diction without embodied grounding lower momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is largely clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity (rain tapping, steam curling, ash grain). Information density is solid and momentum generally sustained. However, several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "hauntingly practical" repeats across paragraphs, "here and gone" is stated multiple times without pressure escalation, and template stems recur ("She thought about," "Elara thought"). The phrase "through crystallized time" appears twice but remains abstract. Figurative density is high without always advancing pressure ("rust-hued peace," "time itself had crystallized"). Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties totaling approximately −0.8 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the lyric mode without sluggishness. Minor scaffold appears: "The object was peculiar, its gears half-buried, its lens cracked" uses parallel construction that borders on template cadence, and "She had climbed here, to this kinetic lagoon, seeking answers, but all she found were fragments—broken gears, rusted keys, and now this camera wheel" lists rather than dramatizes. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats; clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.7)
    Syntax varies and clarity is maintained, but several phrases loop conceptually ("maze of intentions" appears three times; "puzzle out" and "equations for hope" recur without reweighting). The final paragraph stacks thematic summaries rather than propelling through image. Template cadence is mild ("He picked it up... noticed intricate engravings... felt like a key") and does not obscure causality, but density suffers from scaffold phrasing ("more than a relic," "not just a place").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "excruciatingly gentle precision" / "excruciatingly gentle care" and "glacial hush" appears twice in similar constructions. Template cadence appears in reflective sequences ("She had been... her heart full... her father... had insisted"). Mixed metaphor: "sanctuary stood... its walls etched with time and silence"—walls can't be etched with silence. Figurative density is high but occasionally strains clarity ("petrichor, a nostalgia that tugged"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but suffers from decorative density without propulsion: "the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint hum of distant machinery, a reminder that even in stillness, life persisted" front-loads atmosphere that does not drive action. Sentence openings show some variety, though several paragraphs begin with "Elara" or "She" in succession. The sundial's "energy pulsing in sync with her heartbeat" and "the weight of his words pressing down on her" are stock embodiment. Minor paraphrase loop: "The sundial in her hand felt warm" followed two beats later by "The sundial in her hand began to glow" repeats structure without advancing pressure. No major loops or template cadence, but information density remains low across discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and maintains consistent tense. However, repetitive sentence stems and loops appear throughout: "She believed... She had spent... She whispered... She knew... She stood." Figurative language is stacked without clear payoff: "the fog thickened," "the glass seemed to hum," "the world itself were holding its breath," "time itself." The final paragraph employs multiple stock metaphors ("her mind alight," "the world itself approved") that dull the closure beat with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is sharp in many beats: "her footsteps crunched softly," "the rustle of leaves that sounded like whispered conversations." Clarity and concision are generally strong. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The thread was her talisman, a reminder of the intricate patterns people wove into their lives, only to see them unravel in moments of loss" paraphrases the concept rather than advancing pressure; "her silence a permission granted" and "a quiet hymn in the stillness" rely on stock metaphor. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("tapestry," "lonesome splendor," "geography she sought") in a way that dulls propulsion. No egregious template cadence or filter stacks, but figurative density near closure reduces information density without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a modest penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied syntax. Opening and closing images frame the quest effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "dusty tomes whispered" / "crumbling map," "his heart quaking" / "his heart sank," and "bitterly sweet" recurs without new pressure. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("forests reclaiming… rivers singing… sky alight") and stock metaphors ("time seemed to have forgotten its purpose," "ancient secrets") flatten momentum. The assembly beat summarizes action rather than dramatizing resistance, and the final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("sacrifice, patience, willingness") without concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Clarity is strong; no loops or major artifacts. However, some phrases lean ornamental without advancing pressure: "Her father's legacy clung to her like the black sand" is vivid but static, and "her heart alight with hope" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward telling emotional state rather than embodying it. Information density is solid, though a few lines could compress further. No text-artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "liquid starlight," "trapped piece of the night sky," "cascade of color" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "the box had not been a prison...but a catalyst" immediately follows demonstration of that fact (−0.2). Template cadence runs through multiple "she had [verb]" and "It was as if" constructions (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("eyes glowed faintly...carried their own moon") and therapy-speak proximity ("prove her worth") in closure vicinity trigger artifacts touching closure (−1.7 range, disallow 9+ globally). Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy (−0.5, disallow 9+ globally per the pack).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Her mission was clear...But how could she achieve this" is immediately followed by "The gear was more than a tool; it was a symbol," then "She realized the gear wasn't just a relic—it was a conduit." Synonym churn ("whispers," "sigh," "hum," "symphony") stacks figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching. Stock metaphors ("threads woven into fabric," "bridge between physical and ethereal," "mirror of her own endless soul") reduce clarity in peak beats. Sentence openings repeat ("As she stood," "As the light grew," "As the last petal fell"). Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a") cluster without voice motivation. Information density is low; many lines restate prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple template cadences and paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "to the stone, to the stories it held, and to the silence between words" and "their stories, and the thundering calm" read as syntactic filler. "Thundering calm" and "spectral mentorship" are oxymoronic phrases repeated without payoff. The final paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("her heart lighter, her purpose clearer") instead of trusting the image. Figurative density ("flight of the butterflies," "migration of memory") in reflective beats blurs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (pendulum as heartbeat, inscriptions as talisman) is coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the clock tower was more than a machine; it was a metaphor" restates the metaphor just dramatized; "keeper of time, a guardian of its lessons" cycles synonyms. Template cadence in the second paragraph ("Its weathered hands paused… Among them was… He was ethically diligent…") and the final paragraph's "not just to wind the clock, but to wind the hearts" stack modifiers without propulsion. The closure image avoids artifacts but mid-story scaffold costs −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high; grammar and sequencing are clean. However, multiple artifacts drag momentum: paraphrase loops ("a puzzle box, one that demanded his attention" restates "demanded" via appositive without new pressure), template cadence in paragraph four ("Each thread corresponded…each symbol…represented"), and stock metaphor strings ("threads of history that frayed at the edges, waiting to be untangled"). The phrase "fingers tenderly organized" is strained; "organized" does not idiomatically pair with "fingers" in this context. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: nearly every sentence in the opening deploys metaphor, creating decorative texture rather than propulsion. Cumulative line-level debt lowers the band despite clean syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    Syntax varies and rhythm supports tone, but several loops and scaffolds persist: "He had not just written a future—he had written a call to action" / "He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it" recycles the same rhetorical structure across closure beats. "The weight of possibility" / "the weight of the scroll" repeats metaphor without deepening. Figurative language saturates the final paragraphs ("gateway," "beacon," "golden glow") without concrete action to anchor them. Clarity and grammar are clean; propulsion slows in the final third as summary overtakes scene. Paraphrase-loop penalty and template-cadence penalty apply once: −0.6 combined in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean, but several paraphrase loops appear: "The radio, an old relic... had been her companion" restates the setup without adding pressure; "her resolve firm" echoes "quiet determination" two sentences later. Template cadence in the broadcast paragraph: "She grabbed... her hand moving... The song seemed... She reached out... She sat back" stacks similar constructions. Purple phrasing ("ember alcove in mist," "thistled calm") appears without pattern-teaching or payoff. Minimal propulsion; many sentences describe rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose leans toward overwriting in peak beats: "somber and marvelous," "beautiful and painful," "silence a testament to the power." Synonym churn appears ("whisper secrets," "bear witness," "testament"). Template cadence is mild but present in adjacent reflection blocks. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the same conceptual ground (impermanence, fragility, mirage of safety) without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but the prose carries scaffold and loops: "his rationally rebellious mind" echoes "her rationally rebellious spirit"; "the thought of losing…was agonizing, but the thought of staying…was worse" is paraphrase churn; "abrasive calm" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. Sentence openings vary minimally—multiple paragraphs begin with "Kael" or "The." Figurative language is sparse and functional; no mixed metaphors or density excess. Information density is low in transit beats ("Days turned into weeks, and Lira returned often") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than showing the realization through image or action. The cog-polishing and artifact-extraction beats lack propulsion; key moves are told ("carefully extracted artifacts") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or pronoun ambiguity. However, several adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "Elara's motivation was clear" followed by a colon restatement; "The library, once a sanctuary" echoed by "It was a place where books were forgotten." Stock phrases accumulate: "hollow silence," "bygone era," "living cathedral." The final two paragraphs contain thesis-like summary ("the true victory," "they were waiting to be rediscovered") that flattens momentum. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, and elevated diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") drifts from concrete action in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several scaffolding patterns emerge: "She knew" appears twice in close proximity, and the peak transformation beat ("Hours passed… the seed sprouting") compresses crucial action into summary. The line "It wasn't just wisdom; it was hope, a reminder of what could be" stacks abstract nouns without concrete embodiment. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt," "she thought") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph moralizes rather than trusting the image. Minor template cadence in the opening ("She wasn't just any chef; Elara could…") and synonym churn around "gentle rebellion" (repeated three times without added pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence openings vary and paragraphs modulate length purposefully, creating visual rhythm. However, several beats loop or restate: "The box was old, its surface gleaming" is echoed by "the lacquer box felt heavier, its patterns now clear," and the riddle's words are quoted twice without new pressure. Stock phrases populate high-pressure moments: "heart raced," "trembling hands," "deep breath." The vision beat—"visions flooded her mind: the drones' creation, their purpose, and the danger they had averted"—summarizes the climax rather than dramatizing it, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loops and summary at closure trigger deductions totaling approximately −1.0 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "seemed out of place, as if it had been left behind intentionally" / "giving them meaning" / "honor what you once were." The final paragraph recycles "hush" three times and "quiet" twice within six sentences, synonym churn that dulls the closure image. Template cadence runs of "He [verb]" across multiple beats reduce propulsion. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "began to") cluster in high-pressure moments, distancing the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Minor scaffold appears: "the ampoule was no ordinary object" echoes "Liora was no ordinary monument," and "cascading revelations" is deployed twice as a thematic label. "Incisively kind" and "animate the lifeless" recur without added pressure. Figurative density is controlled, but "fracturing like the garden's ancient stones" and "thread weaving through lives" are competent without surprise. No loops obscure causality; information density is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She was balancedly daring, a trait that had carried her through countless trials, yet this endeavor felt different" restates information without added pressure. Template cadence: "Her boots scuffed...her breath steady...Her motivation was singular" uses repetitive possessive-noun openings. Stock metaphors ("ghost in her memory," "weight of her regrets") appear in non-peak beats. Figurative language density is moderate and doesn't obscure causality, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify adequately. Information density is moderate; most lines advance atmosphere or action. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "She thought of the people in her daydream, their kindness evident" summarizes rather than showing, and "The motivation that had driven her for years… now took on a new form" is meta-commentary that slows momentum. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalty severity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are clear and grammatically clean with varied structure, but several loops and scaffolds dull momentum: "the lens was more than an artifact—it was a catalyst, a reminder"; "displaced peoples...displaced...never truly be displaced." Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching ("rosewater dread," "bridge to another time," "beacon of hope"). The final two paragraphs summarize outcome rather than dramatizing it ("spread like wildfire," "knew that as long as they remembered"), deflating propulsion at closure. Information density is moderate; no major opacity, but pervasive minor redundancies lower the grade.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies appropriately between longer atmospheric sentences and shorter action beats. Some paraphrase loops appear: "the hunger stone started to glow, its latent radiance pulsing" immediately followed by "the stone's light intensified." Template stems recur: "He had done it. He had stepped beyond fate's design" and "He had initiated a change, and now he would have to live with it, his neatly inventive mind already racing." Filter verb "felt" appears three times in the final two paragraphs during peak pressure ("felt a surge," "felt alive," "felt was tinged"). Minor density loss from scaffold phrasing reduces momentum without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.3)
    Phrasing is clear but carries template cadence: "She opened...She realized...She stepped out...She smiled." Figurative language clusters densely ("skeletal reminder," "repulsive allure," "photographically cursed," "lingering luminance") without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph moralizes theme overtly rather than trusting image. Paraphrase loops appear: "fear's weakness" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Deduct −0.6 for template stems and stock metaphor strings in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is high, but information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action or knowledge. Template cadence is pervasive: "He was not merely…but," "The orchard was…," "As he…" sentence stems repeat across paragraphs. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("restlessness was gone, replaced by a restless euphony") and filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he knew," "he realized") that dull immediacy. Minor scaffold penalties accumulate but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and mostly propulsive, with strong opening and atmospheric detail. Sentence variety is present, and no paraphrase loops or synonym churn are evident. Minor scaffolding: "her purpose both quiet and relentless," "her resolve unshaken," and "her resolve as unyielding as the turtles themselves" repeat the same character note without advancing it. The final paragraph's summary mode ("hope that the patterns would lead her") tells rather than showing the stakes shift. Information density is solid, and figurative language is controlled without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are clean and grammatical with varied structures. Opening and closing images (rosebush, illuminated letter) frame the piece purposefully. However, paraphrase loops appear: "emotionally rational" is defined twice in close succession, and "truth was rescued" echoes "recapture truth" without added pressure. Stock phrases ("layers of deception," "fragile balance") and metaphor strings (loom/weaving, seed/dig) accumulate without sharp propulsion. Paragraph cut test: several middle paragraphs restate Elara's mission without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence appears in multiple beats: "Its stone arches were half-buried... its pillars bore carvings" and "He was not just a surveyor—he was becoming the archeologist... he was a keeper of what had been lost" create parallel structures that dull momentum. Paraphrase loops recur: "interlaced absence" is defined twice in adjacent lines, and the final paragraph restates the thematic claim three ways. Figurative language ("hushed blaze") is recycled without reweighting. The mosaic reveal is vivid, but scaffold phrasing and stock transitions ("Hours passed, the sun dipping lower") reduce line-level density and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence runs throughout: "Her X was Y" and "She [verb], her [noun] [participle]" structures repeat across 8+ sentences without taught pattern (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "trace honest origins" / "uncover truths" / "validate her findings" recycle the same concept (−0.3). Figurative overwriting in peak beats: "whispers of the library," "hum with potential," "echo the library's stillness" cluster without payoff (−0.4). Clarity holds, but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; spatial choreography tracks without confusion. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the arc effectively. However, multiple scaffold patterns appear: "His hands, calloused from years of gem polishing, moved with precision" front-loads exposition; "The realization struck him like a wave" is a stock metaphor; "luminous torment," "profound," and "embrace" are high-register choices that dilute immediacy. Paraphrase loops occur ("transform grief," "transformation you seek," "transform it") across adjacent beats. The crane-unfolding beat ("each crease a memory, each fold a moment of sorrow") stacks parallel clauses without advancing pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and metaphor stock in mid-range beats; no artifacts touch the final image directly, so the deduction remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with good clarity and rhythm variation. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "shattered world" and "fragments of her old life" and "pieces herself back together" cover similar ground without adding pressure. "Bleak exhilaration" and "intangibly tangible" read as decorative rather than functional. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling: "no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker, a hunter of light in the darkness" stacks synonyms where a single image would land harder. Information density is moderate; some beats could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity and grammar are sound; no major loops or pronoun drift. Information density is low—several paragraphs paraphrase the same quest logic ("find the pieces," "follow the star trails") without advancing pressure. The opening and closing gestures ("stars were beginning to flicker" / "stars above seemed to guide him") form a template frame rather than a charged reprise. Figurative language is sparse and conventional ("weight of history pressing down," "brilliant dimness"). Sentence openings show moderate variety but settle into "Kael [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across multiple beats, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid, but the piece carries noticeable overwriting: nearly every paragraph deploys figurative language ("like a physical force," "like a relentless tide," "as if the ocean itself was trying to tell a story," "like a wave"), creating density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the guilt gnawing at him" recurs across beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("he had thought," "he had known," "he knew he couldn't") flattens propulsion. The watch-hand beats are clear, but "sieved hush" appears twice without justification, reading as forced motif recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. Multiple beats open with character-name stems ("Elara stood," "Elara knew," "Elara smiled," "Elara's lips"), creating template cadence across the piece (−0.5). Stock metaphors appear: "mist... like forgotten secrets," "chains of mistrust," "chasm between." Figurative density in the opening (furrowed hush, storm-worn, windblown, shrouded, clung) front-loads lyricism without payoff at closure. Paraphrase loop: "untether" recurs in dialogue and closing summary without added pressure. Line-level artifacts touch the final paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity is generally strong, and sentence rhythm varies. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "to align her heart and her actions, to find a purpose" restates the same goal; "as if mocking her" / "as if it could cleanse" repeats the hypothetical construction; "one stroke at a time" / "where she'd been... where she could go" / "past while embracing the future" cycle through summary reassurance with stock phrasing. Filter verbs ("felt," "glanced") cluster without clear voice motivation. The figurative load is dense in places ("relic of a life," "candle in the wind," "golden light") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some images verge on stock. These artifacts touch the final paragraph ("merrily melancholic smile," "embracing the future"), lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with no major loops or template artifacts. Figurative language ("forgotten galaxy," "shadows he couldn't shake") appears frequently but remains legible. However, several phrases feel stock ("the weight of his choices," "carry, even when it hurt") and the final paragraph stacks reflective summary that deflates momentum. Information density is moderate; many lines describe state rather than advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    Syntax is clean with no grammar errors, but sentence openings are repetitive (nine paragraphs begin with "Elara" or "The orchard/guardian"). Template cadence appears in consecutive lines: "It was a call, a challenge, a promise" and "It was no longer a creature of myth but a bridge between worlds" both use the "It was X, Y, Z" pattern. Stock fantasy phrases pervade peak beats: "ancient patterns," "energy crackled," "held its breath," "bathed in silver light." Paraphrase loops: "paradoxically steady" appears in both the opening and near-closing without evolving meaning. Information density is low—scaffolding phrases ("she knew," "she felt") pad without advancing. The final paragraph moralizes instead of landing an image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "weight of forgotten dreams," "choking beauty," "noose," "fireflies," "kaleidoscope" cluster in adjacent paragraphs, creating muddle rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "moments she had missed" / "moments that had slipped past her" / "the moments still waiting to be claimed." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation. Clarity holds at closure but density obscures causal linkage in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans on template cadence and scaffold phrasing. Paraphrase loops appear: "The portal opened with a whisper" followed immediately by "Elara stepped through," then "But as she explored, she realized" (summary without embodied discovery). Stock metaphors recur: "gravity of sorrow," "beacon of hope," "new dawn." The opening is anchored, but the final line ("ready to guide humanity toward a new dawn") is aspirational assertion rather than a charged image. Information density is low in the middle third, where stitching and dimension-awakening are told in general terms rather than specific sensory beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe appropriately. Clarity is maintained, but information density sags in the middle beats with paraphrase loops: "whispering hush grew louder, though it remained just out of reach, a tantalizing mystery" recycles the hush description without new pressure. Stock metaphor strings appear: "timeless dance," "vibrant hush," "invisible hand." Template cadence in the opening ("Elara stood... Elara, once a woman... Elara often wondered") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to urge," "felt a strange affinity," "felt a profound sense") dull immediacy. The final paragraph's "she walked forward, guided by the vibrant hush" echoes scaffold phrasing. Minor artifacting in peak beats (bottled lightning bugs "began to glow brighter, their light pulsating") uses generic intensifiers. Apply −0.6 baseline for loops/scaffold, −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences vary in structure and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several template constructions appear: "Her attention turned to," "With a steady hand," "Elara's heart quickened," and the repeated "she knew" formulations across paragraphs create mild cadence repetition (−0.4). The phrase "winking hush" in the penultimate paragraph is vivid but arrives late and feels ornamental. Paraphrase loops are minor (e.g., "no ordinary intruder; their presence was tied to the blackout, to the cradle" restates connection without added detail). Information density is moderate; most sentences advance situation or thought, though the final image summarizes rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several phrases echo stock Fantasy/literary templates: "weathered face," "world still held mysteries," "until the tides ran dry." The opening and closing rely on metaphor density without clear payoff ("jagged edges kissed," "borrowed dawn"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The sacred patterns were not just in the eels or the stars; they were in everything" restates the entire premise. Clarity is maintained, but momentum sags in the final two paragraphs with summary and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy appear throughout: "a vigil for the truths they were about to unearth" / "when masks slip, when the world reveals its raw, unfiltered self" restate the same idea; "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving into a singular clarity" is immediately followed by "They understood now why…" (−0.6 for loops). Stock metaphors ("lightning cracking like a whip," "storm's fury mirrored") and elevated register ("rarefy," "cartographer of scars") pile up without clear propulsion (−0.4 for density without payoff). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "As [clause]" without variation (−0.3). The final paragraph summarizes the entire arc in tell rather than showing a single decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paragraph openings vary and grammar is clean. However, synonym loops proliferate: "dignified chaos" recurs three times, "overture" appears nine times, and "mechanical arm" is paraphrased in five adjacent beats without functional variation. Template cadence dominates the final third: "Questions were not… they were…" "the chaos became…, the silence became…, and the duel became…" Stock metaphors ("silence is absence, not presence") flatten peak exchanges. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same philosophical claim without advancing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "a testament to resilience and hope" echoes "stories of resilience and hope"; "not just physically, but as a sanctuary" mirrors "more than a repository…a symbol." Metaphor density is high ("streets whispered," "moon cleared," "river breaking through a dam") without clear payoff, and some vehicles are strained ("molted personalities monthly" is asserted but never visualized). Filter-verb stacks ("began to see," "felt a jolt," "thought of") dull immediacy in reflective beats. Information density is uneven—exposition about the grandfather and monthly molting pads without advancing present pressure. No grammatical errors, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Figurative language is frequent but often generic ("the horizon itself was waiting," "kaleidoscope of colors," "arbor seemed to sigh") without grounding in physical logic. Stock metaphors and elevated diction appear in multiple peak beats (film dissolving, stepping into the reel, arbor's approval) without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying a −0.5 deduction for density without coherence. The final paragraph summarizes emotional shift ("blend of sorrow and hope, of endings and beginnings") rather than letting image carry the weight. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding remains ("She realized then," "knowing she had").

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence lengths and clear action order. However, template cadence and stock phrasing pervade: "her heart steady," "her mind racing," "its eyes glowing," "the blooms seemed to lean," "a symbol of resilience and the enduring power of memory." Figurative language ("air shimmered with the promise of life," "memories to dissolve like ink in water") appears frequently without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loop in final paragraph: "symbol of resilience" and "enduring power of memory" restate without added pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.0)
    Rhythm is controlled; sentence variety supports the meditative pace. Information density is moderate—several sentences loop thematic content ("the color of unspoken apologies" recurs, "tides of remembrance" is re-explained). Figurative language is frequent and sometimes strained: "the color of unspoken apologies" and "cerulean regret" are declared but not embodied in concrete imagery. Paraphrase loop: "The color he had sought was not something to be found but something to be released" and "tides of remembrance" both restate the same abstraction. Minor filter-verb reliance ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to whisper"). The phrase "tides of remembrance" appears three times without evolving meaning. No major artifacts touch closure, but density sags in the middle third.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a good balance between description and interiority. Some phrases verge on conceptual abstraction (“preprocess reality,” “quiet architect, building something unseen”) and repeat thematic ideas rather than adding new pressure. Still, there is minimal scaffolding or obvious redundancy, and sentences usually do more than one job. Rhythm is steady and readable, though it could use more variation or surprise to truly stand out in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatically solid, and free of major scaffolding or repetition artifacts, with some evocative lines (“where shadows danced and silence hummed”). At times the language trends toward mild purple or abstraction (“drifting resonance,” “seemed to whisper of hidden patterns”) without always adding concrete insight. Sentence rhythms and structures repeat enough to feel a little uniform, but not so much as to drag momentum seriously. Overall, the line work is serviceable with moments of grace, but not yet razor-honed for maximal density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and strong information density—most sentences do more than one job (atmosphere plus character or premise). Figurative language (“as if the universe had held its breath”) is mostly apt and not over-stacked, avoiding purple drift. There are minimal redundancies or scaffold sentences; momentum flows smoothly through description and action. The prose doesn’t quite reach a formally dazzling register, but it’s more than publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong imagery and few outright redundancies; sentences usually carry both atmosphere and information. There is some mild repetition of ideas (Elias’s weariness, the forgotten city, the library’s stillness) without always adding new layers. Figurative language is mostly controlled and legible, though phrases like “chased stillness” are evocative more than precise. A modest tightening of summary passages and a touch more concrete, sensory specificity in the middle third would significantly sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and readable, with clear syntax and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. There are some stock turns of phrase (“weathered many storms,” “embers of a dying fire”) and a mildly elevated register that occasionally slips toward generic lyricism. Still, sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and most lines do at least two jobs (setting tone while moving plot or clarifying character). There is no figurative muddle that harms clarity, but also little line-level surprise that would distinguish this at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally precise; many sentences do double duty for mood and information. There is some redundancy in emotional beats (hands trembling, breath slowing) and in reiterating her motive, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it occasionally skirts purple prose without fully collapsing into muddle. No major scaffolding or syntactic artifacts obstruct clarity, including at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world-building. There is some adjective and abstraction stacking (“texture of time,” “otherworldly glow,” “ethereal light”) that verges on the generic and could be sharpened, but it does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum. Redundancies are mild and mostly in the conceptual lexicon rather than outright loops. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not at the razor-honed level implied by the venue standard.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but depends heavily on familiar metaphors and templates (“symbol of decay,” “bones,” “gesture of defiance,” “eyes burned with purpose”), which softens impact. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea (chains as both burden and strength, hope vs. decay), creating a mild sense of redundancy. Rhythm is mostly mid-length sentences without daring compression or sharp cuts at peak moments. Line-level craft is solid but not yet lean or surprising enough for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong sentence variety and high information density—most lines carry worldbuilding, mood, and character at once. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and tonally aligned, avoiding real muddle; phrases like “collected it, carefully, as one might gather fragile glass” land cleanly. There is minor repetition in concept and cadence (e.g., multiple “It was said”/“It was not a noise, but a feeling” constructions), but not enough to meaningfully drag momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean, supporting a smooth read.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and readable, with varied sentence rhythms and few outright redundancies or scaffolding lines. Imagery around light, moonbeams, and stations is handled with relative control, avoiding the worst excesses of purple prose. That said, phrases like “her heart ached” and the repeated “press her ear against destiny’s door” and “illuminated moments” edge toward cliché and slight overinsistence on the motif. Line-level work is solid but not yet surprising or ruthlessly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and generally well-paced, with some strong images (glass spheres as “tiny universe[s] of possibility,” cracks where “the light entered”). There is mild redundancy and explanatory phrasing (“The metaphor was not lost on her,” repeated heart/ice/thaw statements) that could be cut for greater sharpness and momentum. Figurative language is competent but occasionally leans toward the familiar or on-the-nose, so the line-level never quite reaches the startling precision expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and largely free of artifacts, with varied sentence structures and a good balance of atmosphere and action; it reads smoothly aloud and maintains momentum. Some phrases are clichéd or redundant (“her breath catching,” “her heart pounded,” “trembling certainty” repeated), and key emotional insights are occasionally told outright. Figurative language is moderate and mostly coherent, avoiding purple excess. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication with minor tightening rather than fundamental revision.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm is varied, and most images earn their keep. Some phrases verge on purple or repetitive (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” frequent “seemed”), but they don’t seriously obscure meaning. Information density is good, with description, atmosphere, and theme often sharing lines. Tightening a few adjectival clusters and trimming redundant qualifiers would sharpen momentum for a prestige market.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and free of major grammatical or structural issues, with some pleasing images (“metallic frame gleaming faintly,” “thoughts unraveling like threads in a tapestry”). There are occasional clichés or overfamiliar moves (“silence that seemed to hold its breath,” repeated “seemed to”), and some abstraction-heavy lines slow momentum. Still, sentences generally do at least one clear job each and maintain clarity and flow. The line-level craft is solid but not particularly surprising or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and purposeful, with few redundancies; prose carries both mood and information efficiently. Some phrases verge on mild purple or conceptual repetition (“ambiguously clear,” “resonant hush,” crystals whispering and approving), but they do not obscure sense or structure. There are no major scaffolding loops, syntactic monotony, or figurative muddles that interfere with momentum. The line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with only small opportunities to pare back repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, largely free of redundancy, and maintains smooth momentum for a reflective piece. There are some graceful images (the marbles’ glow, the rainbows in foliage) and the sentences read clearly. At the same time, there is a noticeable reliance on abstract formulations (“concept of mended deception,” “true beauty lies in the effort”) and high-level restatements where concrete, idiosyncratic detail could carry more weight. Trimming a few explanatory lines and sharpening images would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear, grammatical, and easy to follow, with decent rhythm and no major artifacts that obscure action or causality. There are some redundancies and mild purple tendencies (“icy warmth,” “mechanically warm glow,” “bioluminescent and ethereal”) that feel more ornamental than necessary. Line-level work often tells emotional states instead of embodying them through fresh, concrete specifics. The writing is solid but could be tightened and sharpened to avoid cliché and repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is smooth and largely free of grammatical noise; sentences carry clear images and maintain momentum. There is some repetition of key phrases and structures (“in between spaces,” “as if,” “it was as if”) that could be tightened, and a tendency toward mild abstraction (“felt a profound sense of peace”) instead of fully embodied moments. Figurative language is coherent and controlled, though not particularly daring. Overall, the prose is solid and readable, slightly overwritten in spots but not enough to obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, sensory detail is well chosen, and most lines do multiple jobs (advancing mood, interiority, and image). There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition around “truth,” “margins,” and the weight/burden metaphors, but it stops short of true muddle. No obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or structural artifacts slow the piece. The final image of reshaping the smudge into a new pattern lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with clear syntax and a good balance of description and movement. Some phrases lean into cliché or familiarity (“her heart quickened,” “her breath caught,” “shadows twisted into shapes that lunged”), and the prose occasionally edges toward purple without adding new insight. Still, information density is decent and there are few true redundancies or muddled metaphors. The language supports the story effectively but doesn’t consistently surprise or compress meaning at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, grammatical, and purposeful, often doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and thematically aligned, with only occasional drift toward purple (“cryptic folds,” “drift of untold seasons”) that doesn’t significantly cloud sense. There are no obvious loops, scaffolding phrases, or cadence templates that stall momentum. The main limitation is a slight preference for abstract nouns over concrete embodiment at peak beats, which keeps some moments from fully landing in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is smooth and mostly economical, with only occasional mild clichés (“the world held its breath,” “face alight with a newfound curiosity”) and no serious redundancy loops. Sentences are clear, varied, and easy to follow, and the prose usually does double duty for mood and character. The lyricism is competent rather than striking, lacking the surprising metaphor or razor-sharp image that would elevate this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and readable, with a clear rhythm and generally good sentence variety. Some lines lapse into mild purple or conceptual clutter (“displaced axis of humanity’s existence,” “when dreams were tangible”) without adding proportionate precision. There is occasional redundancy of ideas (the end of dreaming and Elara’s theories are reiterated) that could be cut for tautness. Still, clarity holds, and the final paragraph lands as an image rather than being smothered by exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans into long, similarly cadenced sentences and repeated abstract phrases (“open secrets,” “mysterious,” “cryptic,” “seemed to”) that create a sense of redundancy. Several sentences restate the same idea with slightly different wording, slowing momentum in a short piece that needs sharper cuts. Figurative language is largely safe rather than fresh, and some metaphors (e.g., “transpose life into a new key” plus “maestro conducting an orchestra”) stack musically themed abstractions without adding precision. Information density is moderate, but there is visible scaffold that an editor would trim.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically controlled, with some striking phrases (“black color shimmering like a void given form”). There is a tendency toward repeated abstract formulations (“void,” “assumptions,” “stillness”) and conceptual summarizing that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language stays largely coherent but sometimes skirts purple without adding new precision. Information density is decent, yet the piece could be tightened by trimming redundant conceptual restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance of sensory image and abstraction. There is some leaning toward purple language and conceptual repetition (mirrors, horizons, symphonies), but it generally reads as intentional patterning rather than artifact. Most lines do at least two jobs—building atmosphere while tracking internal state—which sustains momentum in a quiet, lyric frame. Tightening a few near-duplicate concepts and slightly overexplained metaphors would sharpen the piece further.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is cleanly structured and grammatically sound, with a smooth sentence rhythm and few outright redundancies. Some lines drift into conceptual vagueness or prompt-like jargon (“periodically eternal nature,” “through procedural generation”) that dulls immediacy. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though the density of abstractions in some paragraphs slightly slows momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publishable in many venues but lacks the compression, surprise, and image-level precision expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and evocative, with strong images like “where the walls hummed with the echoes of rhythms long forgotten” and good information density. There is some mild redundancy and flirtation with purple (“trapped in a silence not of her choosing,” “consumed by her task”), but it does not significantly obscure sense or momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and pattern-consistent. Line-level craft is solidly publication-ready with room for tightening rather than in need of structural rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence-level writing is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with decent variation in sentence length and no major loops or confusing figurative language. Some redundancy and scaffolding appear in phrases that restate internal states instead of deepening them, and a few lines lean toward abstract summary over concrete enactment. Word choice is occasionally generic for a high-literary target (“something was amiss,” “it was active,” “larger threat”) and misses opportunities for sharper specificity. The prose supports the story effectively, but rarely does more than that.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, cleanly punctuated, and do at least double duty in advancing mood and character. Sensory description is rich without often tipping into purple, and obvious scaffolding or synonym loops are rare. A few coinages and images (“crystal shadows,” “aromatically cautious”) flirt with decorative cleverness rather than necessity, but they don’t materially obscure sense or momentum. Overall, the prose is polished and fluid, just shy of the razor-sharp compression and surprise expected at the most elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is solid: clear syntax, varied rhythms, and generally efficient interweaving of description with interiority. A few phrasings veer toward mild purple or repetition (e.g., repeated invocations of “texture of time,” “impossible choices”), but they don’t significantly blur clarity. Most lines do at least two jobs (world, theme, or character), and there are no major scaffolding loops or stack-of-metaphor muddles. Strong, professional prose, though it could tolerate a light tightening for maximum compression.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with generally high information density: most sentences do double duty for mood and meaning, and rhythm shifts appropriately with intensity. Some phrasing leans toward the ornate or repeats concepts (e.g., reiterating the hush’s depth), but it doesn’t become muddled or obstruct clarity. There are no obvious scaffolds, loops, or figurative contradictions in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clean, with strong sentence-level rhythm and purposeful sensory detail; most lines do at least two jobs (world, mood, character). There is some mild redundancy and slightly ornamental phrasing (“weaving it into a tapestry of feeling,” “amber light warmer”) that leans toward the familiar rather than the surprising. Nonetheless, clarity is never impaired, and momentum holds for the length and mode. The piece is well above average line-level craft, just not razor-edged or stripped of all mild cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some nicely turned phrases (“final note hung in the air like a promise,” “cautious exuberance”). There is mild repetition of key abstractions (kindness/compassion as cycles) and some familiar constructions, but no real padding or confusing figurative runs. Sentences generally pull their weight and maintain momentum in a quiet register. Line-level craft is competent and sometimes graceful, though not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally elegant, with layered images doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“luminescent ache of the crater’s edge,” the arbor’s shifting patterns). Sentences mostly carry multiple functions without evident scaffolding or repetition, and syntax is clean. A few phrases verge on purple or repetitive—particularly the reiterated “web of kinship” and thematic abstractions—but they don’t seriously cloud clarity or cadence. The closing paragraphs could benefit from one or two cuts of explanatory language to let images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is mostly lean and precise, interweaving description, action, and interiority with good momentum for a quiet piece. Imagery around time, canals, and echoes is evocative without tipping into full purple, and there are few redundancies or scaffolding sentences. Some phrasing trends generic or thematically on-the-nose (“a wave of understanding washed over her”), but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or dull closure. Line-level craft is solid and clean, just short of strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are clear, mostly concise, and free of major artifacts or loops; each paragraph advances either plot, world, or theme without obvious redundancy. There’s some repetition of abstract phrases (“ambiguous loss,” “mathematics of emotion”) and the prose leans into summary at key emotional beats rather than sharpening through image, which slightly flattens momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, avoiding purple excess or mixed metaphors. It’s solid, professional line work that could be elevated by a bit more compression and sensory specificity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often elegant, with some striking images (“sapphire hush,” “metallic veins humming faintly”). Line-level momentum is mostly maintained without obvious loops or scaffolding, and sentences tend to do at least two jobs (atmosphere plus action or theme). There is some mild purple/abstract phrasing and repetition of emotional summaries (“their heart filled with purpose,” “motivation burned brighter”) that could be tightened. Still, no major figurative muddles or artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with some strong images (the warm leaf in her palm, rain drumming on the roof, mossy trellis as both barrier and gateway). However, there is noticeable repetition of key abstractions—control, transformation, metamorphosis, sanctuary/cage—often in near-paraphrased sentences that could be tightened. A few lines lean into purple or generalized language rather than fresh, concrete detail, especially in the middle reflective passages. Line-level craft is solid but not yet sharpened to the density and precision expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structure and some striking images (“tapestry of parched lands and reclaimed seas,” “haggard awe of a world reborn”). There is a mild tendency toward purple phrasing and abstraction in spots, but it rarely muddies clarity or momentum. Information density is decent—most lines do at least two jobs—and there are few, if any, obvious loops or scaffolding sentences. Line-level craft is solid but not yet razor-sharp enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and mostly well-paced, with some appealing phrases and a clear, fluid rhythm; sentences reliably advance either mood or information. At the same time, there is noticeable abstraction and repetition (“unseen forces,” “everyday magic,” “the cave’s music echoed,” “bright darkness”) and some paraphrase-like moralizing near the end that could be tightened. Figurative language is controlled enough to avoid muddle but stays within safe, familiar patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and efficient, with sensory specificity and minimal redundancy. Occasional phrases (“reactively visionary,” “navigated absences”) flirt with abstraction or purple, but do not seriously blur meaning. Sentences typically do more than one job, blending atmosphere with character focus, and there are no major syntactic or logical errors. The overall line work is strong but not yet distinctive enough for elite-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly well-paced, with sentences that carry both atmosphere and forward motion. Some phrases and constructions recur or tilt toward the familiar (“trembling certainty,” “defied explanation,” “as though they had been waiting for her all along”), edging into mild cliché. Figurative language is frequent but not piled to the point of obscuring sense; it supports rather than derails clarity. Trimming a few redundant descriptors and on-the-nose lines would tighten momentum and elevate the overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly free of redundancy or syntactic clutter; sentences advance story or mood without obvious scaffolding. Some metaphors and abstractions are stock or mildly purple (“vast, whispering sea,” “unheard symphony that now lived in her heart”), but they remain legible and don’t obscure action. Rhythm is competent if unremarkable, with a relatively uniform, even cadence that fits the calm tone but doesn’t heighten key turns. There are no major artifacts, but the prose does not yet feel sharpened to literary-competition standards.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with some effective images and a reasonable sense of momentum from sentence to sentence. However, there is notable purple-leaning language and repetition of similar abstractions (“endless, aching void,” “monotonous cycle,” “chaotic symphony”) that do more atmospheric telling than precise showing. Figurative density is moderately high without always earning its keep, and several lines paraphrase prior ideas instead of advancing them. The line-level work is solid but not yet trimmed or specific enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level writing is competent and clean, with solid rhythm and few technical slips; sentences usually do more than one job. Some phrases are cliché or schematic (“fresh start,” “puzzle missing its final piece,” “weight of her honesty as a strength, not a flaw”), which dulls the impact. There’s minor repetition of conceptual frames (“fair trade,” “sense,” “purpose fulfilled”) but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Overall, the prose supports the story without yet reaching the density or freshness expected for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean and well-paced, with varied rhythm and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Occasional phrases (“incandescent restraint,” repeated invocations of hum/whispers) verge on the purple, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Information density is decent: most lines do at least two jobs (setting + interiority, or atmosphere + stakes). Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though it lacks the compression and surprise of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and rhythmically competent, with some strong images (the poison label “tether” and the crates as “archives” of the erased). At times, it leans into abstraction and repetition—phrases like “texture of memories,” “whispers of the past,” and “lives the world had chosen to forget” recur in similar registers without always adding new pressure or specificity. Figurative language is frequent but rarely muddled, though a few metaphors (e.g., “symphony of lives intertwined”) feel stock. Overall momentum holds, but a tighter line edit could reduce redundancy and heighten precision.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images doing double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language (e.g., “sunset trapped in glass,” “whisper of closing pages”) is mostly precise and not over-stacked. There’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; almost every line earns its keep. The prose isn’t radically distinctive, but it comfortably meets high-literary expectations for clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with decent rhythm and no major artifacts or loops. There is some repetition of key phrases (“foundation stone chip,” “gentrification”) and a reliance on summary over scene in the middle that slightly flattens momentum. Figurative language is restrained and generally apt, avoiding purple excess. Line-level craft is solid but not especially compressed or multi-functional in the way top-tier short fiction often is.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, rhythmically varied, and generally efficient, with some nicely turned phrases and effective sensory detail. There are a few stock metaphors and familiar constructions (“the weight of her task pressed on her,” “reach for the stars,” “her heart quickened”), and occasional mild redundancy, but they don’t significantly impede momentum. Figurative language is present but not so dense that it becomes purple or muddled. Line-level work is solid and publishable with tightening, but not yet exhibiting the precision and freshness expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally fluent and readable, with solid rhythm and a good blend of sensory detail and interior commentary. Yet it often drifts toward purple or redundant phrasing (“the air hung heavy with the scent of oil and iron,” “seemed to pulse with the rhythm,” “as if the world itself was holding its breath”), stacking similes and intensifiers that don’t increase pressure. Several sentences paraphrase nearby ones in loftier language, adding ornament rather than new information or movement. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally vivid, but it would benefit from pruning and sharper compression.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences are clear, rhythmic, and mostly free of redundancy, with figurative language that supports rather than obscures images (e.g., condensation as veins of a map). Information density is decent: description usually advances mood and theme, not mere ornament. There is some mild repetition of phrases and emotional summary, but not enough to drag momentum or blur causality. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not yet strikingly spare or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatical, with a readable rhythmic flow and some nice turns of phrase (“wild hush,” “conducting an orchestra of ghosts”). There is mild redundancy and scaffold (“His mission was clear,” “Elias’s infinitely patient nature had paid off”) that could be cut to sharpen momentum. Figurative language leans familiar but not overwrought, and no metaphors actively confuse the scene. Line-level craft is solid and publishable but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows without obvious syntactic stumbles, making the story readable. There is some repetition of ideas (“gathered hush,” “secrets,” “ephemeral”) and summary-like scaffolding that restates stakes and realizations rather than layering new information. Figurative language stays mostly safe but also drifts into the abstract, sometimes blunting immediacy instead of sharpening it. Line-level craft is solidly functional, not yet at the density or precision expected for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatical and generally fluid, with some striking images and no major syntactic or clarity problems. There is a tendency toward abstraction and repetition of key phrases (“hush,” “lattice sustained impossibilities”) without always adding new nuance. The closing paragraphs in particular explain rather than letting concrete action and image carry weight, which dulls the final cadence. Line-level, it’s solid and readable but not yet honed to elite compression and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmic, and image-rich (“air hung heavy with the scent of petrified blossoms,” “branches twisted like the arms of a mourner”). Most sentences pull double duty for mood and information, and technical control (grammar, clarity) is solid. There is some purple density and conceptual repetition around debt, betrayal, and the bead’s resonance, which slightly blurs impact rather than sharpening it. Still, there are no serious loops or artifacts, and momentum holds across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and often pleasing, with some strong images (the plate’s colors seeping into stone, the canyon “exhaling”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases (“path from ruin to reverence,” “hauntingly optimistic,” similar sentence rhythms) and a tendency toward abstraction over concrete dramatization. Figurative density occasionally verges on purple, with multiple metaphors stacked without additional narrative work. Overall clarity is maintained, but line-level tightening and greater variety would significantly sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is fluent and largely clean, with coherent imagery (roots as veins, mural cycles) and a smooth sentence rhythm that suits the meditative mood. There is some redundancy and mild purple tilt—paired clauses that restate the same idea (“not just excavating a tomb; she was unearthing a legacy”) and stacked abstractions that could be cut for sharpness. Line-level craft rarely obstructs clarity, but it also rarely surprises with precision or compression. Tightening repetition and grounding a few abstractions in fresher, concrete images would materially lift the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are generally clean and grammatical, with readable rhythm and no major clarity failures. There is some mild purple (“shimmered with a soft, ethereal glow”) and a tendency toward redundant explanation (e.g., restating Lyra’s motivations and beliefs), which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe rather than striking, and information density could be tightened by cutting reiterations. Overall the prose is solid but not yet razor-sharp at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is polished, with generally clear syntax, varied sentence structure, and purposeful description; there are few if any outright clumsy lines. Some metaphors and phrases repeat familiar cosmic/fate language (“fabric of reality,” “cosmic thread,” “adjacent possibilities”) that verge on abstraction rather than sharpening immediacy. Expository passages could be tightened to avoid slight redundancy, but they do not seriously impede momentum or clarity. Overall, the prose is competent and often pleasing, if not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong—sensory, economical enough, and free of major redundancies or syntactic glitches, with good momentum across paragraphs. Metaphoric density is high but not incoherent; images stay within a coherent atmospheric palette and rarely clash or confuse. There is some reliance on slightly stock lyric constructions and thematic statements, which softens impact in peak beats. Nonetheless, line-level craft is clearly professional, with no artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is fluent and often beautiful, with good sensory density and some lines doing double duty for mood and theme. There is occasional overwriting and explanatory redundancy (e.g., declaring symbols as symbols, repeating her motivation in abstract terms) that could be tightened without loss. Metaphors are mostly coherent and not conflicting, though the accumulation of figurative language risks slight saturation. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece, and the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with a good balance of description and movement. There is some mild redundancy and abstraction (“lost joy,” “renewed sense of purpose,” “pensive mirth”) where more concrete, sensory expressions could carry the same ideas with greater force. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid purple prose, though a few phrases verge on familiar (“tears streaming down her face,” “spark of the lost joy”). The closing image is clear and strong, even if the diction leans a bit generic in summarizing her inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean, mostly concise, and moves the scene forward without major loops or scaffolding. There are a few mildly purple or redundant phrases, but figurative language does not swamp clarity, and action ordering remains easy to follow. Several sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus mood plus character motion), giving decent information density. A sharper pruning of stock abstractions (“confusion and wonder,” “far greater”) would lift the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful, with solid sensory choices and few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language (“edges blurred by fear,” “codes woven into the mundane”) is mostly apt and not over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. There are occasional generic formulations and slogan-esque cadences in the final paragraph, but they don’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Information density is good for this length, with little dead weight at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable, with a consistent rhythm and occasional memorable images. There is some purple-leaning abstraction and conceptual repetition (e.g., reiterating her motivation and the shell’s sanctuary role) that could be tightened for more impact. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it rarely collapses into mixed metaphors or true muddle. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at the concision and density expected for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and largely free of scaffold or redundancy; most sentences pull double duty for mood and information. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and controlled; images like “shards of moonlight” and “names that shimmered like starlight” are conventional yet clear. There is some drift toward purple or decorative modifiers (“deserted marvels,” “foxglove regret”) that don’t always add concrete pressure, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Line-level craft comfortably meets a high professional standard even if it doesn’t yet feel razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmic, and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Imagery—threads, symphonies, glowing symbols—is coherent and consistent, even if occasionally verging on the ornate. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“symphony of truth,” “promises”) and a slightly purple tint, but it doesn’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Line-level control is strong enough for publication with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often vivid, with several sentences doing double duty for mood and information. There is some repetition of concepts (“trembled,” “encrypted compassion,” “harmonize conflicting values”) and occasional purple edging where metaphors stack (“amphitheater seemed to breathe… expanding and contracting as if alive”) without adding new pressure. Still, clarity is maintained, and there are few true scaffolding lines or loops. Tightening redundancy and pruning a couple of overworked metaphors would significantly sharpen the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, fluent, and mostly concise, with evocative images like “mapping the swirl of dust motes” and “paper trail of half-truths.” There is some repetition of conceptual vocabulary (paper trail, balance, blooming/withering) that edges toward overstatement rather than trusting implication. Sentences vary in length and carry good information density without obvious scaffolding or muddled metaphors. Strong craft overall, but not yet razor-honed; a demanding editor would likely trim abstractions and tighten a few summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally precise, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning; most sentences earn their place by doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is consistent and mostly clear, with only occasional near-repetitions (“fractured hush,” restatements about thresholds) that slightly soften impact. There are no major scaffolding loops or mixed metaphors, and the closing image is clean. Trimming a bit of explanatory phrasing in the last third would sharpen momentum and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied in length, and often carry both image and emotional movement. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and anchored in the setting, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase-loop bloat. At times, diction slides toward the purple or abstract (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder,” on-the-nose epiphanic sentences) which slightly dulls immediacy. Tightening some modifiers and trusting concrete images more would lift the prose into a higher register.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with clear sequencing and minimal scaffolding. Imagery is often effective (the crater glass constellations, shifting patterns), and description usually does double duty for mood and world. There is some mild purple tendency—stacked adjectives and repeated emotional formulations—that could be pared back for greater precision and impact. Nonetheless, line-level craft supports clarity and atmosphere without major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lines are generally smooth, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with some pleasing images (threads in a tapestry, symphony of randomness). There is some repetition of concepts and register—“orchestrated serendipity,” “monotony,” “serenade,” “calculated wilderness”—that edges toward abstraction and softens impact. Figurative language is controlled enough not to become muddled or purple, but it sometimes tells us an idea instead of sharpening a concrete moment. Information density is decent, though a few sentences paraphrase nearby ones in different words.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and generally high-density, with many sentences carrying multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, interiority). Some metaphor stacking (“shadows stretched like whispers,” “miniature galaxy,” “each letter a tiny galaxy”) edges toward purple, but clarity remains intact. There are few true loops or scaffolding sentences; momentum is preserved across descriptive passages. Under the rubric, the consistently high figurative load in peak beats justifies a modest deduction but does not seriously obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is technically clean, with clear syntax and few if any grammatical issues, and many sentences pull double duty for mood and information. That said, it leans on familiar formulations and paraphrastic repetition (multiple statements of his “motivation” and “purpose”), and some abstractions (“noctilucent reckoning” explained rather than dramatized) dilute immediacy. The rhythm is gently uniform, which suits the tone but limits propulsion and makes the epiphany feel somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and easy to follow, with some effective images like scars “glowing faintly” in moonlight and guilt clinging “like smoke.” Most sentences pull double duty for atmosphere and character, and there are few outright redundancies. However, there’s a mild tendency toward abstract, themed language and repeated formulations (cracks mirroring fractures, pain as universal) that edges into mild purple and slightly slows momentum. Line-level craft is solid and publishable with tightening, but not yet razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images and a good ear for rhythm (“time seemed to fold in on itself,” “serene upheaval of her own making”). Information density is respectable: many sentences do double duty in setting and theme. However, there is some purple tilt and conceptual repetition—“patterns,” “equations,” “hope,” “parallel timelines,” “trial balloons”—without always adding new pressure, which slightly dulls momentum. Tightening a few redundant phrasings and leaning more on concrete embodiment over repeated abstractions would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with strong images like “its walls breathing with the whispers of forgotten centuries.” Some lines lean toward purple or mildly redundant metaphor (e.g., ivy “seemed to watch her, its tendrils curling like fingers”) without adding new pressure, and there is occasional summary of emotional state rather than dramatization. Still, sentences generally do multiple jobs—advancing scene, character, and mood in tandem—and there are no major loops or artifacts that stall momentum or obscure action. The closing paragraphs are especially tight and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Some repetition and mildly purple phrasing—recurring abstractions like “promise of renewal,” “testament,” and repeated calmness—soften the impact. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to obscure clarity, and the closing image of the parapet shimmering works well. Line-level craft is strong enough for publication, though a demanding editor would likely trim and sharpen for maximum precision.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and free of obvious errors, with some pleasing phrases and stable syntax. There is mild repetition of certain motifs and formulations (“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “ritual significance,” abstracted emotional labels), but not to the point of true looping. Figurative language is fairly conventional but mostly coherent; the line-level rarely obstructs meaning or momentum. It’s solid, workmanlike literary fantasy prose without the compression or freshness that would push it into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are clear, varied, and purposeful, with effective images like the salt flat as a “cracked mirror” and the map of riverbed fissures. There is some repetition and mild abstraction (“echo of extinct birds,” “fractured grace”), but it doesn’t significantly impede momentum or clarity. Exposition about her past is compact and mostly efficient, integrating backstory without derailing the present scene. Overall, the prose feels publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, largely free of grammatical error, and often beautiful, with good rhythmic variation and integrated imagery. However, there is a tendency toward lush, abstract phrasing and repeated intensifiers (“bodily poetic grace,” “alarming serenity,” “weight of their lives”) that occasionally trade precision for atmosphere. Some sentences reiterate similar ideas about echoes, individuality, and serenity without adding new pressure or detail. Overall momentum holds, but a tighter, more concrete line choice in key beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and mostly well-paced, and paragraphs advance either mood or decision. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“moments of clarity that shimmered like embers in the dark,” “half-lit epiphanies”) that lean toward mild purple prose without adding new information. Figurative language is frequent but not egregiously mixed; still, trimming or sharpening several metaphors would increase density. Momentum is adequate for a quiet piece but could be tighter if some explain-y lines were cut or made more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, largely clear, and often beautiful, with several sentences doing double duty for image and theme. There is some repetition of concepts and adjectival stacking (“blushing stillness,” “fragment of a forgotten dream,” “transiently rooted”) that edges toward purple and slightly slows momentum. Line-level rhythm is varied enough to avoid true monotony, and there are no serious clarity or grammar issues. Trimming a few redundant phrases and tightening modifiers would sharpen impact without harming the lyric quality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is controlled, mostly concise, and rhythmically pleasant, with several strong images (the rope glowing like “the first rays of dawn breaking through a winter storm”). Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some phrases lean toward purple or generic uplift (“a spark of hope in a world that had almost forgotten how to dream”), which slightly dilutes impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are never seriously impaired, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and free of mechanical errors, with several strong images (vines curled “like serpents,” storm as heartbeat). There is some paraphrase looping and adjective stacking (“precisely playful,” “ethereal grit,” repeated structural patterns) that add a touch of purple and make sections feel redundant. Most sentences pull their weight, but a tighter line edit could sharpen momentum and reduce abstraction. Clarity at closure remains intact despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it relies heavily on repetition and abstract phrasing (“encrypted devotion,” “seal a covenant,” “dusky harmony”) rather than dense, multi-tasking lines. Several sentences paraphrase or restate similar ideas about the palace’s state, Kael’s motivation, or the tile’s significance, slowing momentum. Figurative language is mostly safe, but there is a mild purple tendency and an overuse of conceptual nouns instead of concrete imagery. Tightening and sharpening would greatly increase energy and specificity without changing content.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a reasonable rhythm and no major scaffolding artifacts or confusion. However, it leans on abstract nouns and repeated sentiments (grace, resentment, broken-but-not-beyond-repair) instead of sharper, scene-specific language. Several sentences paraphrase the same emotional idea without adding pressure or new detail, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are mostly clear, with concrete images and purposeful modifiers; there’s minimal redundancy and no major grammatical or logical slips. Some metaphors (“glass mountains,” “fog pressing like a living thing”) verge on the purple but remain coherent and pattern-consistent rather than muddled. The prose maintains momentum through the middle workshop section without bogging in explanation. It’s polished and publication-ready, though not yet at the dazzling, line-by-line distinctive level of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with good rhythm and no significant grammatical or clarity issues. Descriptive lines often do double duty, advancing mood and theme alongside image. Some phrasing leans toward the generic or sentimental (e.g., “a talisman of hope and regret,” “accidental wisdom of her journey”) and there is occasional conceptual redundancy. Overall momentum holds, but the line-level could be tightened and sharpened for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with some attractive images and a solid rhythmic flow. There is mild repetition of conceptual language (“forbidden knowledge,” “nonlinear inheritance,” “mysteries”) and occasional over-elevated phrasing, but not to the point of obscuring sense. Most sentences carry at least two jobs (setting plus mood, or theme plus character), and there are few overt scaffolding lines. The line-level craft is solidly competent, but not yet sharp or surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some appealing images (“petals ticking like a clock”) and no major line-level artifacts or confusion. There is some tendency toward abstraction and familiar fantasy formulations (“air shimmered with temporal energy,” “fabric of reality”), and several sentences perform single, expository jobs. Momentum holds, but key beats are often told in broad strokes instead of being compressed into sharper, multi-function lines. The writing is solid but could be tightened and made more specific to meet elite-lit standards.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with solid rhythm and no major grammatical issues or structural confusion. Imagery such as “hazy embrace of a foggy bay” and “tangled narrative threads” is effective, though at times language edges toward familiar formulations and abstraction (“haunting melody of what once was,” “blissfully aberrant lives”) rather than fresh, concrete specifics. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts, and each paragraph advances mood or action. The line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking but not yet at a sharpened, high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some strong images (the rope’s fibers “holding the weight of centuries,” gears ticking in rhythm with thoughts). There is noticeable redundancy and scaffolding—phrases like “Her task was” / “Elara’s task was” and reassertions of clarity/absence recur without adding new pressure. Figurative language borders on generic at times and tends toward telling abstractions over concrete specifics. Momentum holds, but sharper tightening and pruning could elevate the line-level work substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable with no grammatical or syntactic confusion, and several images (“their walls humming faintly as if singing in unison with the earth itself”) land pleasantly. However, there’s noticeable repetition and mild purple drift: “gently luminous glow” and hum/harmony recur without new nuance, and some phrases (“her spirit light,” “song—a melody of silence, a lullaby for the storm”) edge toward generic lyricism. Sentences often do only one job at a time, with some paraphrasing of what the prose has just shown. Momentum remains intact, but the prose could be tightened and sharpened for higher-impact density.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatical, and clear, with a good balance of scene and light summary; sentences vary enough in length to avoid monotony. There are occasional purple or slightly clichéd turns (“heart raced,” “piercing the darkness,” “time long past”), and some repetition of ideas, but not to the point of real drag. Description, action, and interior thought are mostly economical and purposeful. Line-level work is publishable with moderate tightening rather than a comprehensive overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with varied sentence structure and a good balance of image and action. Some lines edge toward summary or abstraction (“The collective memory was speaking, not in words, but in emotions”) where a more concrete, specific rendering could deepen impact. There is mild purple-leaning diction and a few conceptual repetitions, but no major loops or figurative muddle that impede clarity. Line-level craft is solid but not at a “cut-to-the-bone” elite level yet.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with few, if any, grammatical glitches and a readable cadence. Descriptions usually do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and paragraphs are reasonably well-shaped. There is some cliché or near-cliché diction (“thick with anticipation,” “like a floodgate opening after years of drought”) and a tendency to restate emotional states in similar terms. Nonetheless, momentum is maintained without major loops or clutter, and figurative language does not significantly muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence-level writing is grammatically clean and generally well-paced, with a clear visual rhythm and no major coherence issues. At times the prose leans into abstraction and recycled metaphor (“texture of time,” “tapestry,” “transitions”) rather than fresher, concrete images, creating a mild sense of sameness. Some sentences double up on similar content—her tangential method’s value and time’s nonlinearity are restated rather than advanced. The result is pleasant but somewhat padded, short of the compression and sharpness expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean and well-paced, and most lines do more than one job, advancing both atmosphere and character. Some metaphor clusters verge on purple or redundant (“intangibly tangible freedom,” “symphony of nothingness”), and certain concepts (silence flavors, hush, freedom) are reiterated rather than deepened. There are no serious clarity or grammar issues, and the ending cadence lands cleanly. Tightening a few abstractions and repetitions would raise it to a more razor-sharp literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level prose is generally smooth, clear, and well paced, with a good balance between description and movement. Some diction choices verge on purple or awkward (“drifted fluidly logical”; a bit of repetition around silence/quiet), but they don’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most do multiple jobs (worldbuilding and mood, or character and theme). Trimming a few redundancies and slightly on-the-nose phrases would sharpen the piece to a more elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level prose is clean, grammatical, and generally concise, with several appealing images (“colors shifted like a living mosaic,” “ceiling a dome of stars”). There is some mild repetition of concepts (“glow,” “ancient,” “path”) and occasional purple-leaning abstractions, but they do not seriously impede clarity. Sentences tend toward similar cadence, yet momentum is maintained and scaffolding is limited. The final realization is stated plainly rather than rendered through a more charged, specific image, which slightly dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, and the narrative flows without major stalls or artifacts. There is some redundancy and mild purple tendency—stock phrases like “haven for those who had lost their way,” “loaded emptiness,” and repeated formulations of duty and darkness make sections feel over-familiar. Figurative language is generally coherent but not especially surprising, and high-level abstractions occasionally replace sharper, concrete detail. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but would benefit from tightening and more idiosyncratic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is mostly tight: sentences are grammatically clean, readable, and move the story forward with minimal redundancy. Imagery is vivid but occasionally drifts toward stock or abstract formulations (“tangled web of broken promises,” “dance between logic and intuition,” “shadowseam wonder”) that sap freshness. There are no major loops or syntactic artifacts, but the prose sometimes defaults to summary-like phrasing where a more concrete beat would sharpen impact. Overall, the language is competent and clear, just short of truly precise or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and free of grammatical or clarity issues; it reads smoothly aloud. Imagery is often strong (“first yawn of evening,” “air thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten dreams”), and most sentences do at least double duty for mood and information. There is mild purple-prose pressure and some redundancy (“eloquently silent” twice; reiterations of legacy crumbling) that slightly blunts momentum, but not to a structural degree. Figurative language remains coherent, and closure is not obscured by line-level excess.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally polished, with varied sentence structures and a strong ear for image; lines often carry both atmosphere and character state simultaneously. Some passages edge toward purple, with stacked modifiers and metaphors (“patterns shifting like whispered secrets,” “storm of light,” “factually mystical light”) that risk redundancy more than they advance pressure. There are no major clarity failures or scaffolding loops, and the final image lands cleanly. Trimming a few ornamental phrases would sharpen momentum and raise information density.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and economical, with sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing action while reinforcing mood or theme). A few phrases verge on purple or redundant (“she was onto something, though she didn’t yet know what”; dust that seems to “approve”), but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and there are no obvious grammatical or logical slips. The prose is solidly publishable with some tightening but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level writing is smooth and mostly clear, with varied rhythm and a good balance of description and movement. There are occasional purple or abstracted constructions (“tyranny of indifference that had suffixed humanity’s spirit,” with a likely word-choice error) and some generalized phrasing that could be leaner or more concrete. Still, there is little true scaffolding or obvious loops, and key actions remain intelligible. The prose is solid but not yet honed to the precision and freshness expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and dense with meaning, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. Some metaphoric layering trends toward purple—e.g., repetition of mist, hush, and glow descriptors—but doesn’t seriously obscure sense. There is mild redundancy in concepts (“whisper,” “hush,” “quietly vivid”) that could be tightened for greater punch. Overall, the prose is polished but not yet razor-sharp in economy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some striking phrases and a steady cadence. At times the language edges into mild purple—piling modifiers and abstractions like “otherworldly energy,” “mossy delight,” “hush where past meets prophecy”—without adding new precision. A fair amount of information is reiterated (her purpose, the arbor’s folklore) rather than compressed. Still, there are no major loops or artifacts, and momentum holds for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and effective images like the bioluminescent fungi and the charred map in the pool. There is some light redundancy and mild purple edging—repeated “swirling leaves,” reiterated thematic statements—that slightly drag momentum. Sentences usually do more than one job (atmosphere plus action or theme), and grammar and sequencing are solid. Tighter cutting of moralizing lines would sharpen the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is clean, rhythmically varied, and generally economical: description, interiority, and theme often share sentences without obvious padding. Sensory images like “iron walls glistening under the pale moonlight” and the kintsugi flask are clear and grounded, and there is little in the way of paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony. A few lines trend toward slightly purple or awkward phrasing (“factually mystical blend”), but they don’t materially obstruct clarity or momentum. The prose is solidly publishable with some refinement, though not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean, grammatically sound, and generally well-paced, with sentences doing clear narrative work. There’s some reliance on familiar abstractions (“fragility of life,” “power of release,” “hidden sunrise broke”) and occasional purple overtones, but they don’t obscure sense. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to feel muddled or overwrought. Momentum holds steadily through the piece without noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clear and rhythmically varied, and the prose sustains a coherent mood. There is some redundancy and mild purple stretch (“symphony of ultraviolet penance”; multiple reiterations of the forest mirroring her mind and mission), which slightly dulls momentum. Conceptual abstractions occasionally replace sharper concrete detail, especially in the final paragraph where theme statements crowd out image. Still, line-level craft is solid, with no major artifacts obscuring sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are clear, grammatical, and mostly economical; the rhythm is varied enough to sustain forward motion. The piece leans into elevated, imagistic language, but avoids outright purple excess or metaphor muddle. There are some mild repetitions and abstractions (“eternal instant,” “weight of untold stories,” “resilience of intuition”) that feel like scaffolding rather than hard-earned images, slightly dulling the climax. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publication-ready, though not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and efficient: sentences are grammatically sound, sequencing is clear, and most lines carry at least two functions (advancing image and mood, or character and plot). There is some repetition of concepts (“weightless burden,” “cracks in the façade”) and a mild tendency toward familiar descriptive constructions, but these do not significantly bog momentum or obscure meaning. Figurative language is sparing and mostly grounded, avoiding mixed metaphors or overwrought flourishes. The prose is solid and publishable, though it lacks the sharp, surprising turns of phrase that would push it into a higher bracket.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, with vivid images (“crystalline spires,” “sea of mist churned, its currents forming shapes that shifted and dissolved”) and few outright redundancies. There is a mild tendency toward purple or abstract language clusters (“rustling awakenings,” “truths buried in the fabric of reality”) but they remain legible and mostly coherent. Sentence structures vary enough to avoid droning template cadence, and paragraphs each add new information or texture. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, though not yet razor-honed or maximally compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (e.g., the shard’s rainbows as both artifact detail and symbol). Figurative language is vivid yet mostly coherent, and the cadence shifts appropriately between setup, vision-climax, and denouement. There is some risk of purple abstraction (“synchronize her mind with the asteroid’s temporal currents”), but repetition, scaffolding, and syntactic monotony are avoided. Line-level craft is already strong enough for competitive venues, though a light tightening of the most conceptual phrases would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with strong information density and few wasted sentences; transitions are smooth despite some summary. There is occasional purple edging and familiar metaphor (e.g., “whispering pines,” “waterfall of stars”), but not enough to obscure meaning or stall momentum. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most carry more than one function (worldbuilding plus mood plus plot). The prose is solidly publication-ready with minor stylistic familiarity keeping it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; sentences tend to do double duty for mood and information. Sensory specificity (rust, moss, eerie blue light) keeps most lines concrete, and figurative language is sparing enough not to feel purple. There are some mild redundancies and abstract phrases (“place where explanations fail,” “something infinite”) that could be sharpened into fresher images. Overall momentum is steady for a quiet piece, though a touch more compression around familiar beats (e.g., generic “her heart quickened”) would tighten it further.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flows smoothly and is largely clear, with some striking images and efficient paragraphing. At times it leans into abstraction and repeated formulations (“scaffold complexity with simplicity,” “timewoven alliances,” “reimagine”) that feel like conceptual scaffolds rather than lived texture. Description occasionally tilts purple but doesn’t fully obscure sense or momentum. Line-level craft is above average but not yet razor-honed in precision and compression for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often graceful and image-rich, with many lines doing double duty for mood and theme. Yet figurative language is dense and sometimes repetitive (“dawning hush,” “umbral tenderness,” repeated light/dark juxtapositions), edging toward purple and softening impact. Some sentences restate ideas in slightly different words, creating mild momentum drag. Rhythm and clarity remain intact overall, but tighter pruning would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with efficient scene progression and some strong images (“shadow stretching like a dark whisper across the sands”). There is a mild tendency toward purple/emphatic language (“searing,” “burned like a torch,” multiple “breath catching” moments), but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Redundancy is limited; most sentences carry at least two jobs (atmosphere + character or theme). Line-level craft is solidly above average, though not yet razor-honed for maximal compression and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a sensible rhythm and no major loops, muddled metaphors, or line-level artifacts. Some phrasing leans on familiar templates (“her mind racing with questions,” “her heart pounding”), and there is a tendency to tell internal states rather than embed them in image and action. Still, most sentences carry their weight and advance either atmosphere or story. With tighter compression and more original micro-images, this could rise into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and mostly free of redundancy, with sensory details that pull their weight. Metaphors (e.g., fruit that “hummed with forgotten stories”) are on-theme and not overstacked, and sentence rhythms vary enough to keep the page from feeling mechanical. Momentum holds despite the reflective nature of the piece; no major loops or scaffolding clutter the text. At an elite level, one might want a bit more compression or sharper, more idiosyncratic phrasing in key lines, but there are no serious line-level flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is solid: syntax is varied, grammar is clean, and most sentences carry clear narrative or atmospheric weight. A few phrases and concepts repeat without adding new pressure (“borrowed time,” “vortex inheritance,” “restore the world”), edging into mild redundancy but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled and straightforward, with only occasional abstraction. The closing cadence is clear and uncluttered, even if slightly prosaic for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful; the prose sustains a calm, rhythmic flow that fits the mood. Some phrasing is slightly redundant (e.g., reiterations of “zero hour,” “motivation,” and the listening/noise contrast) and occasionally leans toward mild purple or abstraction. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, and grammar and sequencing are clear. Trimming some explanatory lines would heighten density and let the strongest images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluent, mostly concise, and free of major syntactic or clarity issues; rhythm and paragraphing read smoothly. There are a few mild repetitions and abstract formulations, but no serious scaffold loops or figurative muddle. At times, the language drifts toward soft-focus lyricism and generalities instead of precise, concrete images that would sharpen impact. It’s strong, competent line work rather than line-by-line arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean, readable, and often pleasing, with some strong images and a stable rhythm. However, it leans into repetition (“weight of unspoken words,” “whispers,” “ghosts” as abstractions) and familiar formulations (“in a tranquil moment of clarity,” “felt a profound sense of peace”). Figurative density verges on purple in places without always adding new insight, and some sentences summarize emotions that could be shown more concretely. Overall, competent line work with occasional overwriting that would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with a few well-chosen images (e.g., numbers becoming symbols, the emerald silo’s faint gleam). There’s little in the way of scaffolding, redundancy, or metaphor muddle, and sentences generally do more than one job. At times, phrasing trends toward mildly generic (“a profound sense of purpose,” “timeless bonds”) instead of sharper, character-specific language, slightly dulling impact at the ending. Rhythm is serviceable but not yet leveraged to heighten peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, rhythm varies, and images like “arranging them like beads on a string” land cleanly. There is some purple edging and repetition of favored constructions (“burnished hush,” “harmonized discord,” “woven dawns”), yet it stops short of clutter or confusion. Most sentences multitask—advancing mood and character simultaneously—and there are few, if any, true scaffolding lines. The closing images are clear and musically phrased, though they tread familiar lyrical territory.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and readable, with mostly clear syntax and a steady rhythm suited to the calm tone. Some phrases and concepts recur with slight redundancy (e.g., reiterating the orchard as testament to harmony, Elias’s “brazen calm”), and there’s a mild tendency toward abstraction and summary over scene at key beats. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid purple-prose collapse but not particularly sharp or compressed. Overall, the line-level craft is solid but not taut or striking enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally tight, rhythmically varied, and dense with purposeful imagery; most sentences do at least two jobs (world-building plus mood or character). Occasional adjective stacks and abstractions (e.g., “larger mosaic of artificial pilgrimage”) flirt with purple but don’t seriously obscure meaning. There’s little evident scaffolding or redundancy, and the final images of merging ambers and descending past footprints land cleanly. Line-level work is strong but not at the rarefied precision of elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong images (“knees creaking like old hinges,” “petals unfolding like whispers of hope”) and few outright awkward constructions. There is some redundancy and near-paraphrasing—several sentences reiterate that his work is about hope, mending, and reclamation without adding new facets—which slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly consistent in tone; it edges toward purple in places without quite tipping into muddle. Overall line-level craft is above average but not at a rarified, publication-ready tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structure and efficient scene progression; it avoids obvious loops and heavy scaffolding. Imagery is controlled rather than purple, and most descriptions do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood or character). There are a few familiar phrases and light abstractions, but nothing that significantly muddies clarity or dulls the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, with some pleasing phrases and a consistent rhythm. However, it tends toward repetition and abstraction—phrases like “echoed silence,” “temporally stretched,” and “true north” recur without always adding new texture, and several sentences restate similar ideas of chaos vs. order. Figurative language is conventional rather than surprising, and the density of elevated descriptors occasionally verges on purple without deepening meaning. Momentum is serviceable for a quiet piece but could be tightened by pruning redundant lines and sharpening concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is clean and easy to follow, with mostly sound syntax and few genuine clunkers. There is some purple/stock phrasing (“otherworldly glow,” “unyielding determination,” “sacredly playful nature”) and a tendency to summarize (“hours turned to moments”) instead of dramatizing high-pressure beats. Sentences often do only one job, so information density and rhythm feel middling rather than sharp. Overall, prose is serviceable and occasionally pretty, but not yet lean, surprising, or compressed enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and generally efficient, with some strong phrases (“luminous absence,” “historian of small gestures”) and decent information density. There is mild abstraction and reuse of similar conceptual language (echoes, meaning, roles, unbinding) without always grounding in fresh sensory detail. Figurative elements are consistent but occasionally verge on the generic-lyrical. Line-level control is solid and publishable, if not yet strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with mostly clear sentence sequencing and a readable rhythm; description, interiority, and action are interwoven smoothly. There are, however, several instances of near-repetitive phrasing and somewhat purple constructions (“maze of whispers and shadows,” “hidden thunder,” “harmony of her fragmented self”) that do similar work without adding pressure. Explanatory sentences sometimes restate what the imagery already implies, mildly diluting momentum. The line-level craft is solid but not yet ruthlessly precise or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some strong images (the platinum thread, frayed tapestry border) and functional rhythm. There is a tendency toward purple/abstract phrasing and repetition of similar constructions, especially around atmosphere and emotion, which adds a slight sense of sameness and overstatement. Several sentences restate ideas (“winnow the soul,” “unravel the knots of her own guilt”) rather than advancing pressure, and the climactic line-message is a platitude rather than a precise, earned formulation. Overall momentum holds, but line-level refinement and cutting would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is solid: sentences are mostly clear, varied, and purposeful, with descriptive passages doing double duty for mood and concept. There is some tendency toward purple or familiar lyricism (e.g., stacks like “soft lilt that danced with the silence,” “forged hush,” “whispering void”) and conceptual repetition around echoes, mist, and longing, but it stops short of true bloat. Figurative language usually tracks and supports sense; there are no serious muddles or loops that obscure causality or closure. Tightening a few clichéd or redundant phrases would bring this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with good sensory density and a few strong images (statue surface “pitted like the moon,” “breaths stolen from the abyss”). There is some redundancy and minor purple edging—phrases like “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion,” “quilts memories together,” and reiterated explanations of her motivation could be tightened. The final paragraph in particular leans on abstract nouns (“meaning,” “hope,” “stories she carried within her”) rather than fresh concrete turns. Line-level craft is solid but not yet refined to elite compression and sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, grammatically clean, and easy to follow, with a readable rhythm across paragraphs. There is some repetition of favored abstractions (“eternity,” “promise,” “sanctuary”) and occasional purple or redundant phrasing, but nothing that seriously muddies clarity or closure. Most lines do at least one job (setting or emotional framing), though some could be trimmed for concision and sharper impact. The prose is solidly crafted at a mid-literary level without the compression or surprise expected at elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished, with smooth rhythms, clear sentences, and purposeful sensory choices that avoid most redundancy. Phrases like “vibrations of intent” and “intentions purified by stillness” flirt with abstraction and mild purple, but they remain legible and thematically on-point. Repeated motifs (the garden scent, the whisper/shout contrast) may be slightly overemphasized but do not significantly drag momentum. Line-level craft is solid enough for competitive consideration, though not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally efficient, with some strong images (“weathered walls bearing the scars of countless storms,” the censer’s patinaed glow) and a steady cadence. There is some conceptual repetition (“raw solace,” “geography of loss,” restated purpose) and slightly generic phrasing that could be tightened for greater density. Sentences usually do more than one job, but key beats are sometimes told in summary rather than sharpened through specific sensory or emotional detail. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally tight and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“The orchard seemed to exhale, its fractured grace restored”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not overstacked, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler sentences. Information is clearly sequenced, and the ritual and closure read smoothly without syntactic clutter. A few lines tilt toward abstract summary (the final moral sentence especially), but they don’t significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with smooth rhythm, mostly lean sentences, and clear sequencing; there are no major scaffolding loops or mixed metaphors. Repetition of key terms (mist, gaps, remember) generally feels intentional and thematic rather than accidental. A few lines tip toward abstraction or mild redundancy, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Overall, the line work is publication-ready but not yet striking enough in compression or surprise for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise; sentences tend to carry clear narrative information without obvious loops or scaffolding. Some phrasing tips toward cliché or purple (“whispered tales of forgotten eras,” “weight of the promise”), but it doesn’t obscure meaning. Figurative language is used somewhat heavily in the opening but thins as the piece continues, so momentum holds. With tighter, more specific metaphors and a bit of pruning, the line-level could approach publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and often evocative, with strong image choices like “bleeding starlight cascaded…like a waterfall of molten silver.” At the same time, it veers toward purple in places, stacking modifiers and repeating phrases (“lacy menace,” “shared exhale”) in ways that don’t always add new information. A number of sentences essentially restate unease or resolve without deepening them, which slightly drags momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and no line-level artifact seriously harms the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mostly clean and readable, with some attractive images (the shell “glinting like a fragment of a forgotten star”) and consistent rhythm. There is a tendency toward purple abstraction and repetition of similar intensifiers (“density of presence,” “revalue,” “scientifically romantic”) that don’t always add new nuance. A few sentences paraphrase prior ideas rather than advancing them, slightly dulling momentum. Nonetheless, syntax is varied enough and the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: imagery like “sky painted in hues of amber and violet” and “fragments of her memories aligned… like a shattered mirror” is vivid and generally coherent. Most lines carry multiple functions (setting plus mood plus interiority), and there’s little paraphrase looping or dead scaffolding. At times the language brushes purple or abstract (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused thoughts”) without always being grounded in immediate action, which slightly blunts momentum. Still, rhythm, clarity, and information density are high and support the emotional arc well.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and generally concise, with several strong lines (“a trembling calm, a balance between fear and faith”; “relic of life’s most ordinary miracles”). Most sentences carry more than one function—advancing scene, character, and tone simultaneously. A few phrases drift toward familiar abstractions or repetition (“ordinary miracles,” “miracles hidden in plain sight”), which slightly blunts the closing cadence. Overall, line-level craft is solidly publishable with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a good balance of sentence lengths. Some metaphors and adjectives risk mild purple prose or redundancy (e.g., reiterating calm vs. storm contrasts and “saturated hush”), but they don’t seriously impede clarity. Several sentences do similar emotional work, and trimming could tighten momentum. The final image is clear and coherent, so line-level issues are more about polish than structural harm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with generally strong rhythm and efficient paragraphs that each add emotional or atmospheric weight. Metaphor usage is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful—“imperfect miracles,” “a living archive of time itself,” “current running through her forever” all support the central conceits. There is mild redundancy in restating the miracle/cracks motif and the orchard’s doomed status, but not enough to drag momentum significantly. Line-level clarity remains high, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically smooth, with effective atmospheric lines. There is some purple or redundant phrasing (“not merely a collection of definitions but a key,” “not just… but”) that could be tightened without loss. Abstractions and repeated formulations slightly dull momentum and keep key beats from landing with maximum sharpness. Still, information density is reasonable and there are no major clarity or artifact issues at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is generally clean: syntax is clear, grammar solid, and most sentences do at least one job without obvious scaffolding or loops. There are a few clichés and somewhat purple constructions, but they do not seriously obscure meaning or momentum. Rhythm is serviceable, though paragraphing and sentence variety could be sharper to underline key turns (e.g., the discovery of the notch and the scroll). Overall the prose is publishable mid-tier but lacks the compression and surprise expected at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is generally smooth, with clear syntax, varied sentences, and strong control of basic mechanics. There are standout images (“quiet wildfire,” “permeable barriers,” the pulsing mushroom), but figurative language sometimes edges into cliché or pseudo-profundity and repeats key phrases without adding pressure. A few lines paraphrase the same insight in different words, especially near the ending, which slightly blunts momentum and impact. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt, and the density is respectable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and often graceful, with strong sensory images (“smelled of old books and weathered wood,” “mica pane catching the faint light of the moon”). Most sentences carry multiple functions—setting, mood, and character insight—without obvious scaffolding. However, there is some drift toward purple or redundant phrasing and occasional abstract generalities that dilute impact. Line-level rhythm remains solid and readable, but tighter pruning could heighten momentum and sharpen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and concise, with vivid images and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences often multitask by advancing atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. A few moments lean on explanatory summary of realizations rather than trusting image and action, which slightly dulls momentum at peak conceptual beats. Still, there are no significant line-level artifacts, and the final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are largely clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a reasonably varied rhythm. Some phrases and ideas repeat (“gently thorough,” “blooming jetty at twilight,” the covenant’s explanation), creating mild redundancy and a slight sense of over-telling. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though a few abstractions (“weight of small moments,” “regeneration”) are leaned on instead of fresher concrete turns. Overall, the prose is polished but not yet compressed or sharp enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly well-paced, with clear sentence-level meaning and no major loops or clutter. Some images are nicely handled (ivy as reclaiming force; the clock frozen at “a time that no longer existed”), but others fall back on familiar abstractions and stock phrases. The closing paragraphs in particular lean on summary and thematic declaration rather than fresh, concrete image. Overall craft is solid and readable but not yet at the razor-sharp, high-density level expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong imagery (“shimmering pool of liquid silence,” “frequencies beyond human hearing”) and good integration of sensory detail. There is some drift toward purple abstraction and echoing (“quiet blaze,” “etched into her soul,” “tapestry of her life”), and a few lines paraphrase ideas already conveyed, but these don’t significantly muddy clarity. Sentence variety and paragraphing support a gentle, forward movement rather than bogging the piece down. Overall line craft is solid and nearly publication-ready, if slightly over-ornamented in places.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is smooth, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with no major loops or confusing metaphors; information flows clearly and momentum is adequate. The prose often carries dual jobs—world-building and mood—without bogging down. However, there is reliance on familiar phrases and abstract formulations (“threshed meaning from experience,” “confidence and willingness to question everything,” “kaleidoscope of possibility”) that flatten freshness. A bit more concrete, surprising language and tighter pruning of reiterated concepts would lift this to a more distinctive literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often pleasing, with a clear sensory palette and minimal clutter. There is some paraphrase and conceptual repetition around Elara’s loneliness, forgotten status, and goal, which slightly blunts momentum in such a short piece. Figurative language is generally safe and legible but also somewhat generic (“a tapestry of emotion,” “a symphony no one else could perceive”). The line-level craft is solid and publishable with tightening, but not distinctive enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-by-line, the prose is clean and grammatical, with clear sequencing and a pleasant rhythm that doesn’t stall momentum. There is some redundancy and mild purple lean (“volcanic tenderness,” “ethereal glow,” “living testament to love and sacrifice”), but it doesn’t obscure sense. Sentences often do only one job—stating action or emotion rather than layering image, character, and theme—so density feels moderate rather than high. Overall, this reads as solidly competent craft lacking the compression and freshness expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose flows smoothly with clear syntax and mostly effective imagery, and there are no major clarity or grammar issues. There is some purple drift and abstraction—“auroral sorrow,” “collective grief… like threads in a frayed tapestry”—and a tendency to restate emotional stakes in similar terms rather than pushing into fresher, scene-rooted detail. A few metaphorical phrases feel interchangeable and could be trimmed without loss, which slightly dulls momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at the precision and density expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lines are generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a steady forward momentum and minimal scaffolding or outright repetition. Some images and phrases carry genuine texture (“whispers travel farther than shouts,” “containers groaning as if alive”), but they coexist with vaguer constructions like “heavy with purpose” or “weight of the moment” that dilute precision. Figurative language is used sparingly enough that it doesn’t become purple, yet it also rarely surprises or deepens our understanding. Overall, the prose is solidly publishable in many markets but lacks the compression and sharpness expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clear and mostly well-paced, and the piece moves without obvious scaffolding or confusion. There is some redundancy and mild purple prose: metaphors and abstractions about darkness/light, calm, and secrets recur without adding new pressure. Figurative language stays legible but occasionally generic (“their words tumbling out like pebbles into a stream”). Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed; a demanding editor would trim and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a clear visual and tonal throughline. There is some paraphrase and motif looping (“amplified quiet,” “humble rebellion,” “seeds of second thoughts”) that adds atmosphere but can feel redundant without added nuance. Figurative language leans toward the general and slightly purple rather than sharply concrete or surprising. Momentum is adequate for a reflective piece, but line-level density could be higher with more economical, image-focused choices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly economical, with concrete images like “the ocean’s breath whispered secrets to the sand” and the glowing scrimshaw doing double duty for mood and function. There’s some tendency toward familiar lyric phrasing and abstract summarizing at peaks (“combative tenderness,” “carefully constructed self”), but not enough to significantly muddy clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, if not yet uniquely arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and coherent, with solid rhythm and few outright redundancies, making for smooth reading. Some sentences double back on the same idea in slightly varied language (e.g., reiterating emotional void and mandate effects) which modestly blunts momentum. Figurative language is controlled and rarely purple, though it occasionally leans on familiar constructions (“loomed like sentinels,” “remade hush”) rather than sharper specifics. Overall, the line work is competent and serviceable but not yet at a stylistic level that would stand out in a top-tier literary queue.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often lovely at the sentence level, with some strong images and a smooth read-aloud flow. Yet figurative language is dense and relatively unmodulated across the piece, creating an almost unbroken fog of abstraction—“tremor of certainty,” “paraphrased the world,” “lantern-moth hush”—that can blur impact. There are paraphrase loops around boundaries, sacredness, and humming quartz where successive sentences restate the same idea rather than advancing it. The line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking, but edging into purple and repetitive, which slightly dulls momentum and the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most doing double duty for character and atmosphere. Figurative language (“shards… like captured rainbows,” “music grew louder, weaving through the air like a living thing”) is apt and not overstacked to the point of muddling sense. There is limited redundancy and no significant scaffold or template-cadence artifacts; grammar and sequencing are clean. A few lines lapse into slightly abstract or explanatory phrasing, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and largely free of syntactic or grammatical distraction, with some nicely turned phrases and efficient paragraphing. There is occasional abstraction and repetition of conceptual language (“texture of connection,” “propel it forward,” “balance between innovation and humanity”) that could be tightened into more concrete images. Figurative language is not overdone, but some lines tell what others have already implied. Overall, the line-level craft is competent and smooth, though not maximally compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with effective sensory choices (light, scent of flowers, texture of curtains) that do multiple jobs at once. Line-level rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some phrases and concepts (withering/bloom, timeless observatory, illumination as enlightenment) verge on the familiar and occasionally feel slightly on-the-nose. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and figurative language remains largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level writing is generally clean and fluent, with good sentence variety and many images doing double duty for mood and theme (e.g., rain as Morse code, ink swirling like storm clouds). Information density is respectable; there’s little scaffolding or obvious redundancy, and key props are economically threaded. Some metaphors lean slightly purple or familiar, and the prose tends to explain its own symbols a bit, but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major artifacts or loops impair the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory images and good information density. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (e.g., reiterating the “atoms of nostalgia” concept and the innocence motif) that slightly slows momentum. Still, sentences mostly do multiple jobs—world-building, mood, and interiority—without collapsing into muddle. No major figurative confusion or structural scaffolding undermines clarity, especially at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with good rhythm and an efficient blend of scene and summary; most sentences do more than one job. Some phrasing (“softly deliberate,” “luminous regret,” “shadow unbound”) is repeated enough to feel a bit like scaffolding or motif by insistence rather than necessity, but it doesn’t obscure sense. Figurative language is mostly clean and apt, though occasionally tendencies toward abstraction (e.g., “vast tapestry of time”) dilute impact. Overall line-level craft is strong and publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with some strong images (“layers of certainty…peeling away like old paint,” “quietly vivid activity”). At the same time, it leans into repetition and abstraction—phrases like “fragility,” “convictions,” “purpose,” “motivation was clear” recur without adding new precision. Several sentences restate similar emotional content, creating mild redundancy and a soft, uniform texture. The line-level craft is solid but somewhat safe and occasionally purple, without the compression or surprise that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is above average: sentences are generally well-shaped, varied, and grammatically clean, with some vivid images and nice rhythmic choices. There is mild overreliance on similar emotional formulations (“wounds,” “scars,” “closure”) and a few summary-like lines that tell where image could do more work. Figurative language stays coherent but sometimes trends toward the familiar or slightly overwrought, diluting impact. Momentum remains intact throughout, but the prose doesn’t yet achieve the economy and multi-layered density expected in elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with a good balance between description and movement. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to become purple, and the images are generally coherent. Some lines lean on familiar formulations (“her mind racing,” “for the first time in a long while”), which slightly dulls the line-level distinctiveness at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally fluent, with strong imagery like “shards of glass that glimmered like captured starlight.” Some phrasing is redundant or leans toward purple (“shadowed rapture,” repeated invocations of whispers and stardust) without adding new information. Line-level clarity remains good; sentences usually do more than one job and avoid mechanical scaffolding. Overall craft is solid, just short of the extreme refinement and concision expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, syntactically varied, and purposeful, with minimal redundancy and no major clarity issues. There is some reliance on familiar phrases (“otherworldly light,” “surge of hope”) and explanatory tags that could be sharpened or cut for density. Figurative language is present but not so stacked as to become purple or muddled. Overall, the line-level craft is competent to good, just shy of the precision and surprise expected at a top literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with several strong images (e.g., “gears bloomed like flowers”). There is some mild verbosity and conceptual redundancy, particularly around Eamon’s searching for meaning and the rainforest as metaphor, but not enough to seriously obscure clarity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it does risk edging toward purple in the climactic revelation. Line-level work is solid and publishable with tightening, though not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance of concrete image and abstraction. Most lines do multiple jobs—advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. There is some mild purple tendency and repetition of similar textures (mist, whispers, vagueness) that slightly dulls momentum and edge. Still, clarity is never lost, and no significant scaffold or looping artifacts weigh down the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for mood and narrative. Repetition of key terms (“silence,” “fortress,” “snow”) reads as intentional pattern rather than accidental looping. A few formulations flirt with purple or conceptual vagueness (“spirit had not,” “frostbitten hope”) but remain legible and thematically aligned. There are no notable syntactic artifacts or scaffolding that impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often vivid; details like “iron gall ink pellet” and “stones seemed to hum with the weight of centuries” do multidimensional work. A few phrases border on purple or generic-lyric (“brighter future,” “weight of a kingdom’s secrets”), and there’s some conceptual repetition around drifting constellations and shadows. Still, momentum holds, sentences generally carry more than one function, and there are no major scaffolding or loop artifacts. The climax could benefit from sharper, more concrete sensory detail to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, largely free of scaffolding or loops, and maintains good clarity; sentences do more than one job and avoid clutter. Images like the station as a “sentinel” and the “periodically eternal” oceans have texture without tipping into purple excess. There is some abstraction and conceptual phrasing in the latter half, and a slight tendency to restate ideas, but not to a degree that seriously drags momentum or muddies the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean and well-paced, with effective imagery and few redundancies; sentences often carry both setting and emotion efficiently. There are some slightly stock metaphors and abstractions (“spark ready to reignite the flame,” “meaning in the mess”), and the thematic paragraph leans more tell than show, but they do not significantly bog the momentum or blur clarity. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the final image resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is clean, with mostly clear sentences, varied rhythm, and effective integration of description and action. Occasional purple-ish or redundant phrasing (“steam rose like ghosts,” plants whispering approval multiple times) edges toward familiar fantasy lyricism but doesn’t obscure meaning. Information density is decent: nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or plot. It reads smoothly and professionally, though not yet with the compression and surprise of top-tier literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with strong sensory images like “a pearl of stillness in a world that had since shattered” and “fluttered like a wounded bird.” Line-level momentum is mostly maintained, and there are few true redundancies. However, some phrasing is purple or repetitive (“pearl of stillness” reused, multiple explicit mentions of resilience/strength), and a tendency toward abstract summary in the closing paragraphs slightly dulls the immediacy and complexity of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Key images—the scattered tarot like shards, the “tapestry” of rearranged cards, the luminescent ache—are clear and potent. There is some repetition of favored metaphors (light/dark, ache, luminescence, threads) and a few slogan-like formulations that edge toward purple. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum hold, and no line-level artifacts significantly blunt the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (“wind-carved encampment,” “patterns that seemed to pulse with a life of their own”). There is mild repetition of key terms (“ephemeral patterns,” “disappearing ink”) and some leaning toward abstract phrasing, but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Most sentences carry more than one function (setting + emotion, concept + action), maintaining decent information density. A bit more cutting of explanatory scaffolding around the thematic statements would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatical, and the piece reads smoothly from start to finish. However, there is noticeable redundancy and reliance on stock phrases (“her heart raced,” “mind a storm,” “at what cost?”) and repeated constructions around silence, echoes, and quiet that could be pruned for density. Key emotional beats are sometimes told in abstract (“her mind reeling from the implications,” “a storm of conflicting emotions”) rather than rendered through fresh, concrete images. The line-level craft is competent but not yet compressed or original enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and generally concise, with few outright redundancies or confusing constructions. There are moments of strong imagery, but also some repeated formulations and slightly abstract phrasing (“senselessly perceptive,” “inculcate the plants with values”) that feel more conceptual than concrete. Sentences tend toward similar cadences, which keeps the piece readable but limits dynamic rhythm, especially at emotional beats. Line-level craft is solidly above average but lacks the precision and layered density expected at a “flawless” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally well-paced, with a clear before/after in the final paragraph that brings the images (garden, spike, constellations) to a satisfying cadence. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “transliterating emotions,” “feral,” and the silence-symphony idea that could be pared for density. Figurative language tends toward the abstract, occasionally dulling immediacy, but it does not produce muddle or obscure cause and effect. The prose is solidly competent and at times poetic, though not yet at a line-by-line, publish-ready sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean with mostly clear, well-structured sentences and a few pleasing images (e.g., “towering glass dome capturing the faint whispers of the wind”). There is a mild tendency toward abstraction and summary over scene, with repeated conceptual motifs (“orbits of regret,” “hidden truths,” “web of deceit”) that occasionally feel like scaffolding rather than fresh, concrete detail. Figurative language is present but not egregiously overwrought; it just doesn’t always deepen pressure. Line-level craft is competent and readable but not yet taut or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images like “meteor hush” and the amber’s glow contrasting the metallic lab. Sentences often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and psychology without excessive scaffolding. There is some repetition of abstract terms (guilt, dissonance, redemption) and a mild tendency toward purple diction, but it doesn’t seriously muddy clarity or pacing. Line-level momentum holds across the piece, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished: images are generally coherent, metaphors are sustained rather than mixed, and sentences often do double duty with atmosphere and interiority. There is little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn, and the rhythm suits a contemplative, mystical scene without dragging. Some phrasing edges toward purple (“mist clung to the air like a reluctant lover”), but it does not accumulate to the point of obscuring sense or momentum. Tightening a handful of abstract or decorative lines would further sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong images (“skeletal silhouette against the shattered sky,” “cradle empathy in arms of steel”) and few grammatical issues. However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts (aberrant mercy, renaming reality) and some paraphrase-like restatement that could be compressed. Figurative language is fairly dense but not incoherent; it occasionally edges toward purple and abstract, softening momentum. Line-level craft is good but not razor-honed enough for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery (“colors bled into the air, swirling like paint in water”) and good sentence-level rhythm. Information density is respectable; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and characterization. There is some mild repetition and a touch of purple/abstract phrasing (“lure possibility from the brink of despair,” “rising nostalgia”) that could be trimmed or made more concrete. These issues don’t meaningfully obscure causality or dull the closure image, but they keep the piece just short of top-tier line sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and generally high-level, with vivid phrasing and clear sequencing; most sentences do more than one job (scene, mood, character) without obvious padding. There is some repetition of key phrases and a tendency toward lush, near-purple description, but not enough to blur meaning or stall momentum given the reflective mode. Jargon-leaning terms like “somatic markers” teeter on abstract but are grounded in bodily cues quickly enough. Overall line-level craft is strong, though not so ruthlessly trimmed or varied in structure as to feel elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and grammatical with decent rhythm, and the sensory lines are often effective (“The air was thick with the scent of salt and damp earth”). There is some repetition of structures and ideas (“It was as if…”, “voice of the unknown”) and a tendency toward explanatory sentences that paraphrase the drama (“Her motivation deepened”). Figurative language is restrained and generally clear, avoiding purple excess. The line-level work is solid but not especially compressed or multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and flows smoothly, with a good sense of paragraphing and sentence rhythm. Descriptions usually do more than one job, building both mood and world without obvious clutter. There is some mild repetition and a few stock or abstracted phrases (“a world hungry for meaning,” “quiet inspiration”) that soften impact and edge toward mild purple. Nonetheless, clarity and readability remain high, and there are no major artifacts or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmic, with strong sensory images (“mist clung to the edges of the world like a forgotten veil”) and minimal syntactic clutter. Most sentences do more than one job, combining atmosphere with character and theme. Yet there is some repetition of concepts (“fixing what’s broken,” “unused courage”) and abstract phrasing that slightly blurs urgency. While not truly overwritten, the language sometimes smooths over tension instead of sharpening it at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with clear sentence-level logic and a strong rhythmic sense; images like “time seemed to percolate through the air” and the ticking gutters are effective. There is some repetition of similar metaphorical textures (fog, percolation, whispers) that approaches mild purple, but it does not obscure meaning. Redundancies are limited and the line-level flow carries the reader smoothly through the scene. Overall craftsmanship is solid, if a bit decorous.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level writing is generally clean and readable, with clear syntax and purposeful repetition of key terms like “glowed” and “thrummed” that build motif rather than feeling like accidental loops. Sentences often carry dual weight in atmosphere and information, and most paragraphs advance either the mystery or Elara’s evolving connection to the oasis. There is some conceptual redundancy—ideas about kindness, connection, and healing are restated rather than freshly dramatized—but it doesn’t seriously impede momentum. Figurative language is modest, consistent, and rarely overextended.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is smooth, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with striking phrases like “quivering hush” and “luminous harbor by moonlight” creating a clear sonic palette. Some repetitions (“rhythm of oars in water,” reasserting motivations) edge toward mild redundancy, and a few lines veer close to purple or expository. Nonetheless, line-level clarity is high and figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. The final image with the lantern and tooth is clean and legible, preserving closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and a mix of sentence lengths; description tends to do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Figurative language is present but not over-stacked, and there are few, if any, true loops or scaffold sentences. Some phrases (“brittle awakenings,” “translate isolation into independence”) verge on conceptual abstraction more than embodied image, and the closing paragraph leans toward exposition. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and line-level craft would require only light tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with strong control of sentence flow and generally high information density. Descriptive passages are often evocative without descending too far into purple, and there are few genuine redundancies or scaffolding lines. Some phrases lean on familiar constructions (“beacon of tranquility,” “testament to the beauty of unity,” “profound sense of peace”), which dulls freshness slightly. Overall, line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with minor tightening of clichés and abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level work is generally clean, with clear syntax, correct mechanics, and straightforward progression. There are some familiar phrasings and mildly purple touches (“dimly lit confines,” “the room seemed to hold its breath,” “vast, unknowable cosmos”) that don’t derail clarity but do blunt freshness. Sentences do their jobs without looping or heavy scaffolding, and momentum is mostly maintained. The prose is solidly serviceable rather than sharply economical or striking.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally smooth and readable, with some strong images (the compass needle “quivering as if alive,” the chamber seeming to exhale). However, there is a tendency toward purple or stock-epic formulations and repetition of similar notes—“reverberation of a lonely church organ” appears twice with minimal development, and phrases like “promise of discovery,” “truths long buried,” and “reshape reality itself” feel familiar. Sentences often do multiple jobs, but a few lines lean on abstraction where a more concrete embodiment would heighten impact. Momentum holds, yet the language doesn’t consistently rise to a truly distinctive or cutting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a good balance between description and action. There are occasional redundancies and explicit paraphrases of what the images already show, especially around thematic statements, which slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is mostly clear, though phrases like “unifying opposites” recur more as abstract labels than sharpened images. The prose is solidly publishable mid-tier but would need tightening and more restraint around abstraction for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with a good balance of description and movement, and minimal outright scaffolding or redundancy. Some phrases tilt toward cliché (“her heart quickened,” “the true cost of bravery,” “chosen wisely”) and a few adjectives feel interchangeable, which slightly blunts impact. Imagery like the atmosphere-map glowing in the floor and the “tornado in reverse” is effective and concrete, giving the climax a visual anchor. Rhythm and sentence variety are adequate, but there’s room to tighten a few summary lines and replace generic emotional tags with more specific, embodied moments.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally fluent and grammatically clean, with some strong images and smooth sentence-level flow. At the same time, it leans repeatedly on a small cluster of abstractions (“pixelated,” “possibility,” “never,” “amnesty”), creating mild paraphrase loops and a sense of conceptual repetition rather than fresh concrete noticing. Figurative language is frequent but not always adding new information, occasionally feeling like decorated scaffolding rather than pressure-bearing detail. Momentum is maintained but rarely sharpened by verbal precision or contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clear and largely free of mechanical errors, with some pleasing phrases and a steady rhythm. There is mild redundancy in concepts and wording around calm, paths circling back, and the symbolic role of the train, and the closing paragraph overexplains what the images already imply. Figurative language is occasional and mostly controlled, though “dusky harmony” and similar abstractions edge toward the generic. Information density is reasonable, but the piece could benefit from sharper compression and fewer summarizing sentences, particularly around the startup’s history.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some effective images (e.g., “words flowing like a river of light,” “the stars witnessed her”). That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrasing (“shared burdens,” “midnight solace,” “heal with words”) and a tendency toward abstract, almost sermon-like sentences in the latter half. Figurative language clusters around similar, light-based metaphors and can blur rather than sharpen stakes. Momentum remains intact, but the line-level craft doesn’t yet show the compression and originality expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and free of major grammatical or syntactic issues, with a good balance between description and movement. Some repetitions and mildly purple turns (“ancient power,” “otherworldly glow,” repeated mirror/serenity phrasing) edge toward cliché but don’t overwhelm readability. Information density is decent—most lines carry atmosphere or advance the scene. Sharper pruning of redundant thematic statements and slightly fresher diction would lift the line-level craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and mostly fluent, with competent rhythm and clear sentence mechanics, and it avoids outright muddle. However, there is a tendency toward repetition and abstract phrasing—“anxious elation,” “purpose,” “mend the covenant,” “whispers”—and a near-uniformly elevated register that flattens modulation. Figurative language is serviceable but occasionally veers into mild purple without adding new information, and several sentences restate similar emotional beats. The line-level craft is solid but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is mostly tight, with strong images (“light seemed to cling to the edges of things, reluctant to fade”) and good rhythmic variation. There is mild repetition of key phrases and concepts (“patch holes in the soul,” “inlaying meaning everywhere”) that risks feeling slightly redundant rather than intensifying. Figurative language stays coherent and within the established register; it doesn’t tip into full purple or obscure action. Line-level craft is comfortably publishable, though a pass trimming a few explanatory or echoing sentences would add punch.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with clear syntax, coherent sequencing, and minimal clutter. Imagery is competent—if occasionally conventional—with only light redundancy (“wrest meaning from the chaos, purpose from the silence” echoes earlier ideas without much new pressure). Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling mechanical. The main limit, at a prestige-publication standard, is reliance on a few stock metaphors and explicit statement rather than consistently surprising, compressed lines that do multiple jobs at once.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a reasonable variety of sentence structures and no major artifacts or loops. Some phrasing tends toward abstraction or repetition (“knowledge,” “transition,” “energy”) and occasionally tells where an image could carry more weight. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, avoiding purple excess. Overall line-level craft is solid and publication-ready with minor tightening, but not yet stylistically striking.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and carry both image and information without much scaffolding. Some phrases flirt with abstraction or purple (“currents of existence,” “wintersun serenity”) but do not obscure sense or pacing. There is mild conceptual repetition around the nature of identity, yet not enough to seriously drag momentum or muddle the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and fluent, with mostly clear syntax and an effective mix of sentence lengths; errors or true muddles are absent. Some abstractions and repeated constructions (“latent radiance,” “resonant hush,” thematic labels like “symbol of unity”) edge toward generic lyricism but do not derail clarity. Many lines do double-duty for mood and worldbuilding, maintaining decent information density. That said, the language could be pared of a few near-duplicate sentiments and elevated further with more surprising, concrete turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with sensory detail that advances mood and character rather than merely decorating. Information density is good: sentences tend to carry setting, emotion, and theme at once. There is some tendency toward repetition (“raw solace,” “patched and re-patched,” several overt thematic maxims) and familiar formulations, which slightly dulls impact. Still, there are no major loops, mixed metaphors, or line-level artifacts that obscure meaning or undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, with few redundancies and mostly clear, propulsive sentences. Some phrases edge toward generic fantasy lyricism (“ethereal light,” “impenetrable fog,” “beyond comprehension”), but they don’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. The prose occasionally tells what it has just shown, especially around thematic revelations, yet avoids heavy loops or scaffolding. Rhythm is varied enough that it reads smoothly aloud, even if not strikingly original.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and often striking (“steam curling like ghosts of decisions past and future”), with good information density and generally strong line-by-line rhythm. There is some purple or conceptual heaviness (“perforated destiny,” “propagate the truth of the violin’s origins”) and a bit of phrase repetition (mulberry ache, promise, destiny) that edges toward over-ornament. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and key actions read cleanly in the climax. Tightening a few abstractions into more concrete images would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally smooth, with clear sentences, solid rhythm, and a good blend of physical gesture and image (“shimmering aurora,” “radiant hush”). There is some repetition of key abstractions (“stillness,” “spark,” “static”) and occasional purple-leaning phrasing, but it stops short of muddling sense. Most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus mood, or action plus interior tilt), supporting momentum for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, with mostly clear syntax and a pleasant, measured rhythm that suits the reflective mood. There are strong images (the glowing hairpin map, the iridescent scallop shell, the lake reflecting stars), though some lean on familiar fantasy and spiritual clichés. Line-level density is occasionally padded with near-redundant abstractions and explanatory sentences, especially around thematic statements, which slightly slow momentum. Overall, the craft is competent and often graceful, but would benefit from sharper compression and more surprising figurative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and generally clear, with smooth sentences and an easy rhythm that suits the reflective mode. Some phrasing drifts toward generic abstraction or cliché (“promise of new beginnings,” “object of peculiar significance,” “tangled threads of his client’s dilemma”), which slightly dulls the impact. There is mild redundancy in explaining the shard’s symbolism and Mara’s doubt rather than trusting the images. Nonetheless, there are no serious loops or muddled metaphors, and line-level craft would be broadly publishable with tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with strong images of stone, water, and starlight doing multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme). There is mild repetition of phrasing and concepts (“carefully woven,” “weight of her mission,” restatements of the grotto’s properties), but not enough to stall momentum. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent; it stops short of purple despite a few slightly ornamental touches. Information density is good for the length, and both opening and closing lines land with reasonably charged images.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally fluent, rhythmic, and free of mechanical errors, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Some lines edge toward purple or redundant metaphor (“carved from the very earth and time itself,” “their surfaces etched with the stories of centuries of layered dust”), layering similar images without added pressure. Nonetheless, clarity remains intact and there are no major scaffolding loops or cadence artifacts. Trimming a few stacked descriptors would sharpen impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with coherent sentences and orderly progression. There is some redundancy and abstraction—repeated terms like “lingering luminance” and generalized phrases like “sense of clarity and purpose” dilute impact. Figurative language is sparse but not always precise, especially “sea of brilliance dimness,” which muddies rather than sharpens the image. Overall, the prose carries the story but lacks density and polish expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is polished and mostly efficient, with varied sentence rhythms and a good balance of description and movement. Strong images (“a forgotten library inside a sunken ship,” “books that glowed faintly”) do double duty for mood and worldbuilding. There is some mild redundancy and abstraction—feelings named in broad terms and motifs like “something greater” or “quest” that flatten specificity—and a few slightly purple constructions. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and there are no major syntactic or metaphorical missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, with a workable rhythm and some effective sentences, especially around the distillation climax. Yet it leans into repetition and mild purple tendencies: concepts like contraction, prophecy, static bursts, and purpose are reiterated with similar abstract phrasing instead of being advanced with new, concrete angles. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same emotional state (anticipation, determination) without adding pressure or specificity, which softens momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always precise, giving the text a slightly over-decorated feel for its scene weight.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with clear syntax, clean sequencing, and a good balance of atmosphere-building lines and forward movement. Figurative language (e.g., fins “glinting like shards of night,” monsters “etched into the air like constellations”) is mostly apt and contributes to the motif of light and crystallization. There are a few abstract or slightly redundant phrases (“weight of forgotten phrases,” “echoes of forgotten lore”) that could be tightened, but they don’t materially slow momentum. No evident scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and often vivid (“hues of pale blue and lavender,” “each droplet was a note”), with good rhythm and few redundancies. Figurative language is used regularly but not to the point of purple muddle, and sentence variety keeps momentum. Information density is solid; most lines do at least two jobs (setting, mood, or character) without obvious scaffolding. It could push further into idiosyncratic precision or sharper compression to reach elite-level line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and readable, with some strong images and an effective rhythmic calm. There are minor tendencies toward purple or redundant phrasing (e.g., multiple invocations of hush, resurfacing, and mirrored imagery) that slightly dilute impact. Most sentences carry at least two functions (atmosphere + character or theme), but a few lines summarize what the scene already implies. No major artifacts or confusion, but also not yet sharpened to high-literary precision and compression.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and mostly clear, with a pleasant cadence and some strong images (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “air hummed with the touch of wonder”). There is a mild tendency toward purple abstraction and redundancy (“ancient freshness,” repeated statement of symbolic roles) but not enough to significantly obscure meaning. Sentences could often carry more than one job—many lines reiterate mood or theme instead of advancing situation or deepening character. Line-level craft is solidly publishable mid-tier but not yet at the precision and density expected for a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and broadly clear, with a smooth, readable flow. There is noticeable repetition of scaffolding structures (“not just X but Y,” “more than a tool; it was…,” “not just a solution but a lesson”) and an overreliance on abstract nouns, which slightly dilute impact and momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent but tends toward the purple and generalized rather than strikingly precise. The line-level craft is competent but not yet pared or sharp enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and readable, with mostly sound syntax and few clarity issues, and it maintains momentum across the scene. However, it leans on stock phrases and light purple flourishes (“endless void,” “settled over them like a shroud,” “wisened woman,” “ancient swords”) and labels emotions rather than embodying them. Some sentences paraphrase or generalize what the next line re-states in more abstract terms, slightly diluting density and impact. The final beats are clear but not linguistically sharp enough to feel distinctive at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful; the prose is smooth to read and maintains momentum. Some formulations repeat conceptually (“orthogonal approaches,” “storm-born silence,” multiple mentions of his mind racing/flowing) but not to the point of loop-like redundancy. Imagery is mostly clear and grounded, with only light abstraction in places like “the hush of a possibility just born.” There’s no major purple overload or syntactic clutter, and line-level craft is comfortably above average.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for action and atmosphere. Occasional purple touches (“macerate the stillness,” “mournfully eager”) land on the edge of overstatement but do not derail clarity. There is minor conceptual redundancy (reiterating his mission and the world’s forgotten laughter) yet not enough to stall momentum. Line-level rhythm varies appropriately and supports the accumulative, musical feel of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with strong images like “eyes, like shards of obsidian” and “foggy lucidity.” There is some repetition of concepts (“boundaries of light,” homesickness, eternal mist) but it doesn’t slip into true loops or purple overload at the line level. A few abstractions (“timeframe—through the veil of sleep,” “make friends with uncertainty”) feel slightly airy compared to the otherwise concrete text. Overall line craft is solid and publication-ready with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with mostly efficient sentences that carry both atmosphere and interiority without major clutter. There are some repetitions and abstract formulations that could be tightened (“stifling destiny,” “creative destruction,” “resurrect the dead” vs. “awaken the dormant”) but they don’t significantly stall momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent and not overstacked, although a few lines trend toward thematic exposition rather than concrete dramatization. Rhythm varies adequately, and the final image is clear and legible on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and grammatically clean, with smooth rhythm and largely effective imagery; sentences often carry setting, mood, and character in tandem. There is some redundancy and conceptual repetition (“not just a relic; it was a key,” “not just a relic of the past; it was a promise of the future”), and a few phrases verge on cliché, which slightly dulls impact. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense that it obscures sense. Momentum is steady, though the line-level texture rarely surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and momentum-friendly, with clean syntax and minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some lines drift toward the generic or purple (“air shimmered with an otherworldly glow,” “kaleidoscope of colors and sounds”) but stay legible and don’t choke the action. Information density is decent—most sentences do at least two jobs—but emotional and sensory texture could be sharper and more particular. There are no significant line-level artifacts that damage causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally smooth and well-paced, with varied sentence structures and a good ratio of image to movement. Key lines carry multiple jobs, advancing plot and theme together, as in the parallel between the altering gallery and her altering memories. There is some repetition of phrasing (“unsettling calm,” “realistically imaginary”) and a light tendency toward elevated abstraction, but it rarely muddies clarity or drags momentum. Overall, the line-level work is solid and publishable, if not yet strikingly spare or cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with good sentence variety and strong image work (“streets wound like veins,” “ships hovered like shards of moonlight”). Most lines pull double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and scaffolding is minimal. A few familiar turns of phrase (“the weight of his words,” some mild redundancy around horizons/constancy) soften the edge, and some metaphors are more decorative than functional. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt and the closing image lands without line-level muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatically sound, with a smooth read-aloud rhythm and few genuine artifacts. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing (e.g., multiple nearly synonymous restatements of her mission and what the atrium “felt like”) that could be cut for greater density. Figurative language is present but not so heavy as to obscure sense, though certain phrases feel stock. The final paragraph in particular explains the meaning of prior images rather than letting them work, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with a good sense of rhythm between longer, atmospheric lines and shorter beats. Some images and phrases feel familiar or redundant (“submerged in time,” “silt and secrets,” repeated “crashing hush”), and there’s a mild reliance on summary in reflective sentences. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no major scaffolding or figurative muddle obscures key beats. Line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean and mostly concise, with good sensory specificity and recurring images that do multi-duty (the shard, inkblot, snow, heartbeat). There is some mild repetition and abstraction (“her heartbeat quickened…her heart counting each beat,” reiterations of “fetch wisdom from failure”) that could be tightened. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and syntax remains clear and fluent. The prose is above-average and publication-ready with light edits, though it lacks the compression and surprise of elite-level sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally well-paced, with strong images like “copper-veined storyteller” and “towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth.” Some phrases repeat ideas or forms (“to save her language, to translate texture into sound”) and a few lines lean toward familiar fantasy abstraction, but not to the point of muddling clarity or momentum. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and action ordering is easy to follow. The language is solidly publishable with minor tightening, but not at a line-by-line knockout level.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely well-paced, with sentences that usually carry more than one function (image, mood, and information at once). There are appealing phrases and a steady rhythm without obvious template cadences or loops. At times, modifiers and abstractions (“strange pull,” “fragile resilience,” “cosmic joke”) dilute precision and edge toward soft-focus purple, but they don’t obstruct clarity. Line-level tightening and a few more concrete, idiosyncratic details would raise it to a more elite register.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is mostly tight: sentences are clear, flow well, and avoid obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. Imagery like “tarnished wonder” and “roots…twisting and writhing like serpents” is vivid without becoming incoherent. There is some tendency toward abstract phrasing and lightly purple description, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. With a little more pruning of conceptual restatement and sharpening of concrete beats, this could reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is mostly tight, vivid, and syntactically varied, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. A few metaphors and abstractions (“where broken promises heal,” “something beautiful to take root”) flirt with purple or generic sentiment, but they don’t obscure meaning. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and action order is clear. The line-level work is strong but not yet at the startlingly precise, risk-heavy level of elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are mostly clean, grammatical, and readable, with a reasonably good balance between description and movement. There is some repetition of similar constructions and abstract phrasing (“his heart full with a sense of purpose”) that could be sharpened, and a few metaphors verge on being soft clichés (“carried the secrets of a thousand forgotten songs”). Still, momentum generally holds, and most lines carry at least two jobs (mood + information). The closing paragraphs could benefit from a touch more specificity and a shade less proclamation, but they are not overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and readable, with solid rhythmic variation and a good balance of sentence lengths; most lines carry both image and function. A few phrases repeat (“sanely eccentric,” “she” starting many sentences) and some images lean familiar, but there is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping. Figurative language is generally coherent and not over-stacked, so the central visuals (spiral shelves, floating scarf, doorway of light and sound) land clearly. It’s strong, professional-grade line work, though not yet distinctive or ruthlessly compressed enough for the very top literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and often graceful, with sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, emotion, and theme) at once. Some phrases and constructions recur (“painting with light,” “cipher of longing,” “whispers”), and certain abstractions (“improbable beginnings,” “luminous absence”) flirt with purple without quite tipping into muddle. The rhythm is mostly varied enough to keep momentum, but the density of elevated modifiers sometimes softens impact instead of sharpening it. Line-level craft is strong but not yet at the ruthless precision seen in elite publications.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is mostly clean and readable, with varied sentence structures and a decent sense of rhythm. Some lines edge into purple or redundant territory (“enveloped in the folds of memory,” “hush of cosmic possibility”) but do not seriously impede clarity or momentum. Figurative language is controlled enough that key beats—the vault opening, the orb shattering—remain legible. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and information density is appropriate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally well-shaped, and the description is clear without sliding into full-blown purple prose. There is some redundancy and mild scaffolding (“Decades later” repeated, emotions sometimes labeled rather than freshly rendered), and a few lines lean on familiar constructions rather than high-density, multi-purpose phrasing. Rhythm is adequate but not doing strong additional work to heighten pressure or contrast beats. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened and made more idiosyncratic to meet elite standards.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, images are often precise, and most lines carry both atmosphere and character. Some metaphors verge on the decorative or familiar (“words flowing like a river breaking through a dam,” “its silence both haunting and serene”), but they don’t obstruct clarity. There’s minor redundancy in describing silence and forgottenness, though not to a momentum-breaking degree. The final paragraphs land clearly with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some appealing images and rhythmic sentences. At the same time, it leans into repetition and abstraction—“essence,” “radiant hush,” “worlds,” “color of wonder”—without always grounding those phrases in fresh, concrete action. Some lines paraphrase the same idea (guardian of wonder / keeper of the radiant hush) rather than adding new pressure or specificity, which slightly dulls momentum. Overall, it’s readable and polished but edges toward purple and generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, binding atmosphere, action, and emotion in the same lines. Some locutions (e.g., “interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”) brush against purple and are echoed more than needed, but metaphors remain coherent and do not obscure sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; the prose moves forward smoothly to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with some nice images (rain etching the stone, history like tree rings), and line-level clarity is strong. There is a tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“worn but unyielding,” “her mind working like a puzzle solver,” “her movements deliberate and precise”) that adds ornament without new information. Key insights are sometimes paraphrased or explained instead of trusted to the imagery, slightly dulling impact. Overall craftsmanship is decent, but information density and freshness per sentence could be higher for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and information-dense, with strong verbs and concrete imagery; there’s little padding or obvious scaffold. The prose sustains a measured rhythm that suits the underwater hush, and key lines (e.g., “as if time itself had paused”) land clearly. There is some mild repetition of ideas (untold stories, letting go, snow swirling) and a tendency to restate the thematic insight a bit overtly in the final paragraph, but it doesn’t significantly stall momentum. Figurative language is sparing and coherent, with no mixed metaphors or purple surges.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structures and a good balance between description and momentum; there are very few syntactic or clarity issues. Some lines lean toward purple or redundant (“soft yet haunting,” “tinkersong wonder,” reiterated liminality), but the figurative language rarely muddies sense. Information density is solid for the length; each paragraph tends to earn its keep. A slightly leaner, more surprising line-level texture—cutting a few familiar adjectives and tightening repetitions—would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some pleasing images (aurora on ice, scattered light through stained glass or a prism). There is mild repetition of key phrases and a slight tendency toward safe, lyrical-general wording, but little outright purple or scaffolding. Sentences vary enough in length and structure to maintain momentum, and the final paragraph resolves on an image with acceptable clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical for a lyric piece, with vivid images and few redundancies or scaffolding sentences. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to overwhelm clarity, and sentence variety keeps momentum. Some lines edge toward cliché or summary (“her resolve unshakable,” “weightless, suspended in the embrace”) and the final paragraph summarizes insight more than it dramatizes it, dulling impact. Still, there are no significant artifacts or confusions, and the line-level craft comfortably exceeds average submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense, with sensory and conceptual work often accomplished in the same line. Vivid phrasing (“mirror the sky inside walls,” “fractally precise movements”) mostly lands without feeling overwrought. There is some repetition of motifs and abstract terms (stillness, endings, infinite/finite) that edges toward mild purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, though a ruthless pass could trim a few explanatory phrases and intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and generally well-paced, with good sentence variety and clear sequencing of action. Descriptive language is occasionally lush but not so overstuffed as to obscure meaning, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or filler sentences. Some phrases (“sociable isolation,” repeated) feel slightly writerly, and the line-level never quite surprises in a way that would distinguish it for a top-tier venue. Overall, it’s solid, readable craft with pockets of polish rather than sustained brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and readable, with some strong images (“words shifting like shadows on the page”). There is mild purple-leaning ornamentation and occasional redundancy in mood phrases (e.g., multiple invocations of light, hush, and nostalgia) that could be tightened without loss. Nonetheless, sentence-level clarity remains high, and rhythm is varied enough to maintain momentum in a largely interior, atmospheric piece. No significant scaffolding or metaphor muddle interferes with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with varied sentence rhythms and purposeful, if lush, imagery. Some metaphors and abstractions (“world of brambled hope,” “present was a fragile blossom”) begin to stack, creating a slight sense of purple prose without adding new information or pressure. There’s minimal redundancy and no major clarity issues, but the preference for ornate description over compression occasionally slows momentum. Overall, the prose is solid and often pretty, if a bit safe and ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) with a smooth cadence, and the prose is mostly clean of scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors such as “pane of hush” and “bruised sky” are striking, and the recurring imagery knits the piece together. However, the density of similar figurative constructions and repeated terms (“hush,” “bruised awe,” “beautifully flawed”) edges toward purple and slightly blunts impact. Trimming a few repetitions and tightening a couple of abstractions would elevate this to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, largely concise, and carry dual loads of atmosphere and information. Figurative language is vivid and mostly disciplined; “fractured spine,” “offhandedly exact,” and “wings whirred like broken gears” are striking without piling up into purple mire. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum is well maintained through descriptive passages. A few abstract phrasings (“a keeper of graceless beauty”) feel more conceptual than embodied, slightly softening the immediacy at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally efficient, with some effective images (“her mind symphonically attuned to the rhythms of molecular bonds”). There is mild redundancy and thematic over-articulation in places, but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent and controlled, without mixed metaphors or heavy purple flourishes. Line-level work is strong and publishable, though not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: syntax is varied, images are clear, and there are few genuine redundancies or scaffolding lines. The figurative language, while frequent, mostly stays coherent and supports the mood rather than tangling sense. That said, there’s some tendency toward purple density and conceptual repetition (“fragmented narratives,” “integrated tales,” “place where stories begin”) that slightly dulls momentum. Tightening a few abstract restatements would sharpen the closing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and mostly concise, with strong sensory verbs and an effective balance of sentence lengths that keeps momentum. Several images—“sandpaper rough memories,” the shard dissolving into light—are striking and thematically pointed. There are mild tendencies toward familiar phrasework and repeating abstractions (remorse/pain/lesson) that could be sharpened, but they rarely bog the line-level flow. Figurative language is present but not so stacked that it muddies clarity or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and flows well, with a good sense of rhythm and generally purposeful sentences. There are some repetitive constructions and familiar lyrical phrases (“symbol of reconciliation,” “community reborn”) that feel like template sentiment rather than freshly observed. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not over-stacked, though the line-level texture can blur into soft abstractions in the closing. Overall it’s publishable-quality craft but not yet sharply economical or surprising at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and polished, with smooth sentences and a consistent rhythm that makes the piece easy to read aloud. Some lines pull real weight through image and concept (the jagged mirror, the faces of prior dreamers), and there’s minimal outright clutter. However, there is a noticeable reliance on familiar abstract formulations and lightly purple constructions that repeat ideas without deepening them (“profound transformation,” “dreams stretched beyond the stars,” “very fabric of reality was being rewritten”). This softens momentum and keeps the line-level work from feeling razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose flows smoothly and is mostly clear, with some effective images (“the very earth held its breath in anticipation”). There is a tendency toward decorative repetition and mild purple (“clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze,” frequent “luminescent” cues) without added pressure or new insight. Sentences are occasionally longer and more adorned than needed, but causality and scene beats remain legible. It’s solid line work, just short of the compression and precision expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally smooth, grammatically clean, and rhythmically controlled, with sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, characterization, and theme). There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose risk—phrases like “intensely quiet,” “whispered secrets,” and “the grove held its breath” accumulate and start to feel like familiar lyric defaults. Still, clarity is never compromised, and the final image reads crisply. Trimming repetitive abstract summaries of her motivation and reusing fewer similar metaphors would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean and readable, with varied structure and an effective blend of concrete image (knight, worry stone) and abstraction. Some phrases and concepts recur in slightly redundant ways (“beauty in the difficult,” reformulations of the covenant’s meaning), and a few lines lapse into familiar inspirational cadence, but there are no major loops or figurative muddles. The prose occasionally drifts toward the generic, especially in the moralizing moments, yet momentum is maintained and clarity preserved. Solid, publishable line work with room to cut minor repetition and sharpen freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, readable, and rhythmically smooth, with some strong sensory lines and a clear progression of images. There is noticeable conceptual repetition (“path to empathy,” “varieties of silence,” variations on stillness and magic) that could be tightened, and several sentences restate similar emotional content without adding pressure. The figurative register is mostly coherent; nothing is egregiously mixed or overwrought, but a few abstract formulations blunt impact. Line-level craft is solid but not quite at the compression and precision required for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some lines doing good double duty for atmosphere and character. However, it leans toward purple in places (“perpetually thick with the scent of blooming flora,” “the wildflower hush…seemed to hum with the weight of unspoken truths”) and occasionally reiterates similar ideas, slightly dragging momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent, just a bit overabundant relative to the low-stakes scene. The final image is clear and not dulled by line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and largely efficient, with some strong images (“whirling silence,” “fruit that shimmered like stars,” bioluminescent veins on arches). Sentences usually carry multiple functions—worldbuilding plus mood, or description plus forward motion. There is mild purple tendency and some conceptual repetition (reiterating resilience, echoes, chaotic environment) but not enough to stall momentum. Line-level craft is professional, though not yet at the cutting-edge distinctiveness or compression expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and well-paced, with a readable rhythm and few true redundancies. There are occasional formulaic phrases (“rapidly adapting mind,” “singular convergence of clues,” “human cost of failure”) that feel more like scaffolding than lived language. Description is sometimes a touch on-the-nose but rarely purple, and events are easy to visualize. Line-level craft is solid, though it lacks the compression or surprising precision that would stand out at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-by-line, the prose is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and a good ratio of image to exposition. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme; phrases like “promise of stillness” and “trapped sunlight spilling into the cavern” work sensorially and conceptually. There is mild density inflation—several sentences stack modifiers and abstractions, especially around the climax, which risks softening impact. Still, there are no serious loops, muddled metaphors, or clarity failures, and momentum is largely maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and mostly concise, with clear syntax and few if any genuine artifacts or confusions. Some phrasing edges toward purple or redundant (“vast, silent canyon” plus “avalanchingly quiet expanse”; multiple reminders of hush and shimmer), but it doesn’t seriously impede momentum. Sentences vary decently in length, and exposition is integrated smoothly enough. Line-level work is solid but could benefit from sharper, more specific images and occasional cutting of repeated concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is largely clean and controlled, with varied sentence lengths and clear syntax; it reads smoothly aloud. Some metaphors and images (“labyrinth of mirrors,” “tapestry,” “essence of human connection”) are familiar and verge on purple or generic, diluting impact. There is mild conceptual redundancy around the halo’s function and Elias’s obsession, but not enough to stall momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and readable, just shy of the precision and originality expected at a top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is clean and grammatically sound, with a readable rhythm and some pleasing images (the aurora as “living tapestry,” the relic syncing with her heartbeat). There is mild repetition of key terms (“ridgeway,” “aurora,” “hum/vibration”) and a few familiar phrases (“void she couldn’t fill,” “surge of something she couldn’t name”), but not enough to seriously drag momentum. Most sentences carry more than one function (world-building plus emotion, etc.), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. The prose is competent and occasionally lovely, though not yet at the razor-sharp density or originality expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished, with clear syntax, strong control of imagery, and minimal redundancy; sentences generally do multiple jobs (setting, mood, and interiority at once). Figurative language is used selectively enough to avoid purple prose, and action beats are easy to follow. There are a few generic phrases and slightly expository lines, but no major loops or artifacts that sap momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and rhythmically varied, with very few genuine redundancies or stumbles. Imagery can drift toward stock mysticism (liquid gold sunlight, unraveling tapestry of time, sacrifice language), and metaphor density is moderately high but not confusing. Information density is good—most sentences carry at least two jobs (setting plus mood, action plus theme). Minor purple-leaning choices keep it out of the top band but do not harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a reasonable balance of description and action. There is some repetition of constructions (“quietly determined,” “deliberate in his movements,” “resolve unshaken”) and a tendency toward summary over scene during the mine descent, slightly flattening momentum. Figurative language is light and mostly coherent, though a few phrases (“a flicker of azure defiance in their eyes”) tread close to familiar fantasy diction. Overall, the line-level work is solid but not especially compressed or surprising for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is competent, mostly clean, and maintains momentum; there are no major grammatical slips or confusing constructions. Sensory details often do double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and repetition is limited. That said, some phrases veer toward mild purple or cliché, and several sentences reiterate similar ideas about the shard, maps, and truth without adding pressure. Tightening redundancy and aiming for more surprising syntax and imagery would be needed for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a reasonable mix of sentence lengths and a mostly efficient progression from image to action. Some sentences paraphrase thematic points or repeat content (“The lamp flickering wasn’t a malfunction—it was a warning”) rather than letting images carry meaning, and a few lines feel like summary scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly restrained and coherent, avoiding purple or mixed metaphors. Information density is solid for the length, but the line-level isn’t yet sharp or surprising enough for top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with strong nouns and a few striking images (“gateway of swirling light,” “deep, ethereal green” dawn). There is some redundancy and mild purple drift—certain ideas are told and then re-told, and metaphors like “sword of light” are familiar rather than surprising. Sentence rhythm is competent but somewhat homogeneous, with similar cadences across paragraphs. Still, line-level issues do not significantly obscure sense or momentum, even if they fall short of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is smooth and readable, with varied sentence lengths and some strong images (the wing casting a kaleidoscope, stories as glowing threads). There is some paraphrase and concept repetition (“beauty can be fleeting,” “fragile and powerful,” “meant to be shared”) that could be tightened without loss, and a few phrases lean toward sentimentality. Figurative language is generally coherent and not overstacked, but several lines carry only one job (restating theme) rather than advancing character or scene. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet razor-sharp for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is competent and mostly clean; sentences are grammatical, readable, and carry atmosphere effectively. There is some repetition of ideas and phrasing (“sorrow,” “what trees witness,” “sorrow made whole”) that could be tightened for greater impact. Figurative language occasionally edges toward purple or redundant, but not to the point of obscuring sense. Overall propulsion is modest but steady, suiting the meditative mode while falling short of the compression and multi-function density expected at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean, largely concise, and maintains forward momentum; most sentences carry at least two jobs (world-building plus emotion, or action plus theme). Imagery like “fruit that glowed like captured dawns” and “lyrics that shimmered like mica” is clear, if somewhat expected, and figurative language is not so dense that it muddies sense. There are mild redundancies in phrasing and concept (knitting, swaddling, rekindling) and a tendency toward summary in the final third, but no major scaffolding or metaphor pileups that obscure causality. Rhythm is serviceable rather than striking, with limited syntactic variety at climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and readable, with a few strong images (“neon lights flickered like restless fireflies”) and mostly solid rhythm. At the same time, it leans toward purple and abstract diction, repeating favored phrases (“enlarged tranquility,” “nestled paradoxes”) without always deepening them. Key insights are often told in generalized language instead of being grounded in concrete, layered action or image, which softens momentum. There are no major grammatical or structural issues, but line-level work lacks the compression and precision expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm and generally effective sentence variety. Some repetition of phrases and concepts (“tenuous absolution,” “sacred in the ordinary,” the explanatory framing of her mission) creates a slight sense of redundancy. Imagery is clear but occasionally leans on abstract or summarized language where one or two more concrete, surprising details could do heavier lifting. The line-level work is solid but lacks the compression and singularity that would make it stand out in a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clean grammar, and a good balance of image with information. Some phrases repeat conceptual ground (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion” vs. later restatements of similar ideas), and figurative language occasionally clusters into mild purple, but it rarely muddies clarity. Most lines pull double duty for mood and worldbuilding, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, charged image rather than expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is clean, grammatical, and mostly concise, with a good balance between description and forward motion. There are no major loops or scaffolding sentences, and most lines pull double duty for mood and plot. Some phrases lean generic or slightly purple (“comforting unease,” “curiously steadfast determination,” “symbol”), and key beats are occasionally told where a more specific image would sharpen impact. Still, rhythm and clarity hold throughout without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally well-shaped, with varied rhythm and a good balance between description and movement; there are few if any true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Images like “terrestrially cosmic spectacle” and “futuristic nostalgia” are vivid without overwhelming clarity, though they edge toward the ornate at times. Information density is solid, and the prose rarely stalls momentum even when it leans into atmosphere. A bit more restraint in abstract modifiers and a stronger show-not-tell approach in key explanatory lines would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with effective syntax variety and few true redundancies. Some sentences double up on the same idea (“sanctuary” now “felt like a cage,” then later prison/womb) and certain phrases (“after the last echo of laughter fades”) are reused in ways that feel more rhetorical than additive. Figurative language is mostly apt but occasionally leans toward elevated abstraction (“inescapable calling,” “rectification of years of silence”) that could be sharper. Still, momentum holds and clarity is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with several effective sensory images (the toxic orange sky, the damp undercity, the hum of the plate). Exposition is folded in reasonably well without derailing momentum, and there are few outright redundancies. Some lines lean toward familiar phrasing or mild purple (“a constant reminder of the world’s fragility”; “glowing brighter than ever”), and high-impact beats could carry more surprise or specificity. Nonetheless, clarity and forward motion are maintained throughout, and there are no structural artifacts that obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically varied, with some elegant images (clouds as a “soft, gray blanket”). There is mild repetition (“symphony of truth,” “color of wonder”) and occasional purple leaning, but no severe loops or figurative muddle that obscures sense. Most lines carry at least two functions (world, mood, character) and avoid clunky scaffolding. The prose is publishable with trimming and sharpening, but it doesn’t yet show the compression and surprise expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally clean, rhythmic, and free of grammatical errors, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding + interiority, or action + mood). The prose occasionally edges toward abstraction and redundancy, reusing the same conceptual labels instead of varying image and texture. Some high-pressure beats are summarized with intensifying adjectives rather than sharpened into concrete, surprising detail. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum hold, and there are several strong, concise images (the pulsing box, the shimmering dome) that carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence-level craft is polished and largely free of mechanical errors, with a good balance of description and forward motion. A few images and phrases are familiar (“painted in hues of gold and amber,” “mind raced,” “her heart quickened”), and the final paragraph leans into explanatory abstraction instead of trusting concrete image. Still, there are no major loops, overstuffed metaphors, or rhythm dead spots; most lines do at least two jobs (mood plus information). The prose is competent and sometimes quite graceful, though not yet distinctive enough for elite-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and easy to read, with varied sentence rhythms and a strong sense of cadence. There is some reliance on familiar formulations (“beacon in the darkness,” “breathe life into the echoes of brilliance”) and a tendency toward reiterating the same ideas in slightly different language. Figurative language is frequent but rarely confusing, and momentum mostly holds despite the density of description. Tighter pruning of clichés and small redundancies would raise it into a truly standout register.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-structured, and varied enough in rhythm to maintain readability, with strong image-work around light, crystals, and pockets of gravity. The prose avoids major redundancy or metaphoric muddle, and information density is decent for the length. However, there are occasional soft spots—summary phrases, slightly generic emotional language, and that “beyond description” line—that blunt the peak beat rather than sharpening it. The language is solidly above-average but not consistently cutting or economical at the highest literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and largely free of grammatical or syntactic issues, with a smooth rhythmic flow. Descriptive density supports mood without tipping into full purple prose, though phrases like “terrestrially cosmic origin” and “tranquil blaze” feel slightly ornamental. There is some conceptual redundancy (reiterating tranquility, balance, and silence) but not enough to drag momentum significantly. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened for greater precision and compression.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful; description, dialogue, and interiority are well balanced without obvious loops or padding. The opening and closing images are sharp, and the figurative language (rooftops “whispering secrets to the stars,” walls that “hum with memories”) is consistent and not overstacked. A few lines veer toward mildly ornate or expository (“the truths we’ve buried,” “the kind that hold societies together”) but remain clear and rhythmically sound. Line-level craft meets a strong professional standard, though it lacks the compression and surprise that would push it into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level writing is generally smooth, grammatical, and rhythmically varied, with some striking images (“room filled with shadows,” “lighthouse guiding lost souls”). There is a mild tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing (“tragically radiant orchid,” then a “tragically radiant expression,” plus overt thematic sentences) that could be tightened without loss. Information density is decent; most lines do at least two jobs (atmosphere + theme, or action + interiority). No major artifacts or loops obscure meaning, but trimming cliché or expository lines would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with effective images like stalactites as a “solemn metronome” and ink dissolving “like mist in the morning sun.” There is a mild tendency toward purple or stacked imagery (“hushed embrace of the marble sanctuary,” “pearl twilight,” “heritage rose thorn…whispers of ancestors”) that risks redundancy but doesn’t significantly obscure meaning. Information density is good—most sentences carry atmosphere and emotional progression simultaneously without obvious scaffolding. Line-level craft is strong and publishable, though not yet at a razor-honed, line-by-line breathtaking level.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some effective images (“pool of liquid starlight,” “voice, a blend of countless others”). However, there is a tendency toward purple repetition—cosmic hums, whispers, secrets—without always adding new information or pressure. Some sentences paraphrase or restate prior content (e.g., multiple formulations of the nexus as shadows/light and secrets), slightly dragging momentum. Still, the line-level never obscures causality or closure, keeping the piece comfortably readable.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and relatively high information density; most sentences pull their weight in advancing either mood or story. There are some familiar metaphors and abstractions (“life a tapestry woven,” “motivation burned brighter,” “symbol of their home”) and a tendency toward mild purple, but nothing that seriously muddies meaning or momentum. The line-level work carries the atmosphere smoothly to the end without visible scaffolding or loops. It’s strong, if not razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically smooth, with several strong images and a good sense of cadence. There is some mild purple/abstract language (“scintillatingly somber,” “symphony of effort and beauty”) and a tendency to restate the same idea (hidden effort/patterns) in similar terms, which slightly dulls momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is never in doubt and no major artifacts mar the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean, with mostly varied syntax and minimal redundancy; information density is decent for the length. There are occasional mild clichés and abstractions (“her sharply observant mind,” “excavated the truth, but at a cost”) that tell what the scene already shows, softening impact. Figurative language is used sparingly enough to avoid purple prose, and there are no major clarity issues or loops. The prose is publishable with tightening but lacks the precision and compression that would push it into a truly standout tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is smooth and largely error-free, with some strong images (“cobalt glass… shimmering faintly, as if alive,” “fracturing into a thousand shards of light”). Sentences vary in length and maintain momentum without obvious scaffolding or loops. However, there is a tendency toward abstraction and repeated conceptual phrasing (visions, purpose, new dawn) that could be sharpened into more concrete, character-specific language. The slightly purple diction occasionally dulls impact but does not obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery (“the note danced inside, shimmering like captured light”) and generally efficient sentences that carry character, setting, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely drifts into muddle or redundancy. Momentum is maintained across paragraphs without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and grammar/usage are clean. A few phrases are somewhat purple or generic, but they don’t materially dull clarity or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and readable with good rhythm, and most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action while maintaining atmosphere). There is a mild tendency toward purple or abstract phrasing (“sonic absolution,” “vibrational disharmony was palpable,” “logically emotional devotion”) but it rarely obscures meaning. Repetition and scaffold are minimal, and the action choreography (stairs, compartment, shoreline) is clear. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet sharp or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with some striking phrases and no serious clarity issues. Yet there is noticeable redundancy (e.g., repeating “patient revolution,” “softly purposeful”) and a tendency toward abstract summary over concrete image at emotional peaks. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but line-level work could be tightened for higher information density and sharper moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level craft is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some effective rhythmic variation. However, there is mild redundancy and purple phrasing (“reverberation of the truth was deafening,” “fortified vulnerability”) that add weight without new information. Figurative language clusters a bit in places but does not seriously obscure clarity or closure. The piece would benefit from tightening clichés and trimming intensifiers to sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally economical, with some well-turned sensory lines (“thick with the scent of aged wood and oil,” “melodies trapped in silence”). There is mild reliance on stock emotional shorthand (“relief washing over him,” “the storm was coming”) and a few metaphors that feel generic rather than freshly minted. Still, the sentences mostly pull their weight, maintain clarity, and support momentum without significant redundancy or purple excess. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, with generally clear sequencing and some efficient summary to cover time. There is mild redundancy and a touch of purple (“gears-and-cogs,” “clanking metal and whirring parts,” repeated mentions of the workshop as microcosm) that could be tightened for greater punch. Sentences mostly carry at least one job, but fewer do two or three at once; the rhythm stays fairly even, rarely using syntax to heighten the climax. Still, nothing at the line level seriously obscures meaning or closure, and the piece is comfortably publishable with moderate tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear, grammatically sound, and mostly free of obvious scaffolding or loops; sentences generally pull their weight in advancing plot or mood. There is some repetition of structures and phrases (e.g., the triad “The patch, the song, the numbers”), but it doesn’t significantly bog momentum. Figurative language is restrained, avoiding purple excess, though the diction can tilt toward bland reportage. Line-level craft is solidly publishable but lacks the compression and rhythmic charge of elite literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally well-paced, with a good mix of sentence lengths and a few strong images (“windows glinting like ancient eyes,” the mirrors rippling like water). There is some conceptual repetition and abstraction (“empathy,” “fractured souls,” “balance,” “courage was not just an act but a way of being”) that could be sharpened into more concrete, character-particular language. Still, there’s little in the way of loops or muddled metaphors, and clarity is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, mostly concise, and rhythmically varied, with effective images like boats “stranded like skeletons in a graveyard.” Some lines verge on the generic or expository, especially around the explicit epiphanies, and there is mild repetition of concepts (her grip on reality, the parasol as fragility symbol). Figurative language is controlled enough not to muddle sense, and there are no significant syntactic or clarity errors. Trimming a few explanatory sentences and trusting the images would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, well-paced, and free of major syntactic or logical artifacts, with some nice lines that braid landscape and emotion. There is mild redundancy and a tendency to state and restate the same insight in slightly different language, particularly near the end, which softens impact. A few phrases veer toward purple or abstract (“a beacon of passionate subtlety”) without adding new texture. Even so, clarity and rhythm hold, and each paragraph broadly advances mood or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are generally well-crafted with varied structure, smooth flow, and few redundancies; the piece reads cleanly at the line level. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so stacked as to become purple or confusing. A few phrases are vague or generic (“strangely honest heart,” “weight of the moment”) where sharper, more concrete choices could increase impact. Overall, the line work is solid and publishable with minor tightening rather than fundamentally flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with some effective images (“iron frames now cradled by creeping vines”). There is mild redundancy and a tendency toward abstract phrasing (“masterpiece of collective healing,” “testament to the power of collective memory”) that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is controlled enough not to become purple, though anthropomorphizing the field (“whispered its approval”) leans sentimental. Overall, line-level craft is solid and readable, if not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with several strong images (“mausoleum of forgotten texts,” “weathered innocence”). Some phrasing is slightly redundant or leans into familiar literary abstractions (“suspended hush,” “weight of unspoken words”) without always adding new information. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to obscure sense, and momentum is maintained through the single scene. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary competition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, image-dense, and generally do more than one job (advancing movement, atmosphere, and interiority at once). There’s some repetition of concepts (“echoes,” “longing,” “clinging”) but it reads as intentional motif rather than scaffold or loop. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; metaphors like “mind a sieve for the present but a prism for the future” are apt and not over-stacked. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece, with no major redundancy or purple excess dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structures and a good balance between image and exposition; most lines carry more than one job (world, theme, and character at once). Occasional phrases verge on purple or redundant (“changelessly constant stillness,” “the very essence of time itself”), and abstract nouns cluster in key beats, slightly dulling immediacy. Still, rhythm is readable, information is clearly sequenced, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. The closure image remains clear and unfogged by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are mostly clean, varied, and purposeful, with good control of rhythm and no obvious scaffolding or loops. The prose leans slightly purple in places (“radiant haven,” “scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”), but it stops short of obscuring clarity. Key images—the vinyl fragment, harp music threading through silence—are sharp and not over-explained. Line-level craft is above average and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a consistent rhythm and no major artifacts or redundancies. Some lines do double duty, embedding worldbuilding into action (e.g., the isle’s tethers straining as a cue of approaching awakening). The prose edges toward generic in places, leaning on mild abstractions (“quiet energy,” “felt different”) rather than consistently specific images or fresh metaphors. Momentum is adequate but not propulsive; pressure moments could benefit from tighter, more concrete line-level choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length, most carry multiple functions (setting plus emotion, or symbol plus action), and there’s little outright redundancy. The prose sustains momentum despite its reflective lean, and major beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Some formulations verge on purple or abstract (“a cleft in certainty,” “nostalgic innovation”) and a few insights are told rather than shown, slightly blunting sharpness. Still, clarity and cadence remain strong, with no major loops or figurative muddle touching the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatical, and readable, with some strong images (e.g., stars as “a thousand eyes” and the grotto’s luminescent moss). At times, the language tips toward purple or repetitive—mist wrapping, serpentine walls, and abstract phrases like “zephyr bloom of her spirit” feel more decorative than necessary. A few sentences restate sentiments (her vow, her purpose) without adding new pressure or detail, slightly dragging momentum. Still, clarity remains high, and no line-level artifact seriously obscures story logic or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with strong noun-verb choices and very few redundancies; description generally does double duty for atmosphere and character. Phrases like “nature’s embroidery” and “honeyed hush” feel earned rather than decorative, and sentence rhythm varies smoothly. There are a few mild repetitions (e.g., restating Elara’s motivation almost verbatim) and occasional on-the-nose lines, but they don’t materially dull momentum or clarity. Overall, line-level craft would be competitive in high-tier venues with only slight tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical, with vivid images like “air hummed with power” and the barnacle-like hopes on the shell. Sentences typically do double duty for atmosphere and interiority, and there are few true redundancies or scaffolding phrases. There is some reliance on abstract clusters (“longing, despair, triumph, and resignation”; “stories it seemed to whisper”) and a consistent mist/whisper/current lexicon that occasionally approaches mild purple, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not yet at a startling or formally distinctive level.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically sound, and generally concise, with some effective images (“light spreading…like liquid gold”). There is mild repetition around certain concepts (“stories,” “remedies,” “harvest moon”) and a tendency toward familiar phrasing that keeps the language from feeling sharp or surprising. Description occasionally edges toward the ornamental without adding pressure, but it rarely bogs down clarity. Line-level craft is competent and readable, just short of the precision and compression expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, largely free of syntactic errors, and often carries multiple functions—worldbuilding, character, and mood—in single sentences. Imagery is generally effective and sensorially grounded, particularly around light, cold, and touch. There is some mild redundancy and a tendency toward repeated constructions and phrases that restate Elara’s patience and the orchard’s stillness without adding pressure or new insight, nudging the piece toward the edge of purple in places. Nonetheless, momentum holds through the scene, and the final image is not obscured by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with some attractive phrasings and a good balance between description and movement. There is mild redundancy (e.g., repeated mentions of “studying reflection angles,” the “wounded season”) and a tendency toward similar sentence cadences in reflective passages. Figurative language is used sparingly enough to avoid purple prose, and clarity is never seriously compromised. Overall, it’s solid line work suitable for publication but not yet at a razor-honed, high-density level.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, layered images, and generally high information density; most sentences do more than one job. The sensory specificity and metaphorical language usually clarify rather than blur. There is a mild tendency toward purple or self-conscious phrasing (“boundary-lessly trapped,” repeated “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) that occasionally feels ornamental rather than necessary. Nonetheless, syntax is clear, momentum holds, and there are no major loops or muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with varied sentence structure and solid information density. Images are mostly lucid and purposeful, and transitions between action and reflection are smooth. There is some mild repetition and ornament—phrases like “hauntingly practical” and “crystallized time” feel a bit over-posed and thematically on-the-nose. These do not seriously impede clarity or momentum but do add a hint of purple that limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluent, with clear syntax and an effective balance between description and movement. There are some clichés (“Regret clung to her like a second skin”) and mild repetition (e.g., “fractured stillness” appears as a favored phrase) that slightly dull freshness. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and not so dense as to obscure clarity or momentum. Tightening a few redundant or abstract lines would heighten impact and move the prose toward a more distinctive register.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level writing is clear, grammatical, and free of major artifacts; sentences generally move the story forward in atmosphere or character. There is some redundancy and reliance on abstract nouns (“purpose,” “intention,” “ambition”) where more concrete phrasing would heighten immediacy. Figurative language remains controlled and not over-stacked, though it trends toward the generic rather than striking. The closing paragraphs read smoothly but lean on interpretive summary instead of letting images fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and largely clear, with few syntactic or grammatical missteps and a good sense of rhythm, especially for a reflective piece. Many sentences pull double duty—advancing both atmosphere and interiority—and the final image is crisp. That said, modifiers and figurative phrases (“glacial hush,” “cradled her like a forgotten melody,” “excruciatingly gentle”) accumulate to the edge of purple, and some ideas are reiterated in slightly different words without adding pressure. Line-level craft is solid but could benefit from some tightening and sharper, less decorative specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is smooth and readable, with generally clear syntax and a consistent rhythm that supports the contemplative pace. Some lines verge on purple or redundant (“serene upheaval in the air,” “thoughtfully clear and deliberate”) without adding new information or pressure, and certain abstractions could be grounded in more concrete imagery. Still, there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts that stall momentum, and the closure image is not obscured by figurative muddle. Tightening repetition and leaning into more specific, less stock phrasing would notably elevate the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise despite the descriptive density. Some phrases and ideas repeat without adding pressure (“oceanic hush,” restating her purpose and the secret weavers’ intent), and the prose occasionally edges toward the decorative. Figurative language remains coherent and doesn’t muddle sense or causality. Overall, the writing is solidly publishable but not yet razor-honed in compression or variation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with concrete images that usually pull double duty for setting and mood. Metaphors (“silhouette dissolving into the twilight like a memory slipping away,” threads and tapestry, “tiny obituaries for the day”) are coherent and thematically aligned. There is some risk of overuse in the tapestry/absence lexicon, but it stops short of purple or redundant looping. Line-level clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, and the final sentences land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows well, with pleasant rhythm and some strong images (the crystalline spires, the blue-lit cavern, the trembling egg). However, there is mild purple-tinge and repetition (“mechanical world,” “bitterly sweet,” conceptual abstractions) that could be tightened, and several sentences restate similar emotional content without adding new pressure. Figurative language is safe rather than startling, and information density could be higher at key turns. Line-level craft is above average but not yet razor-sharp or maximally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, fluid, and purposeful, with most images doing double duty for mood and theme. Some metaphors and abstract phrases repeat or verge on cliché (“heavy and unforgiving,” “spark—a flicker of unyielding compassion”), and figurative density is fairly high. Still, there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy, and the final paragraph lands with clean rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is largely clean and fluid, with strong imagery (“water once sang through stone lips,” “memories like liquid starlight”) and good information density. There are mild tendencies toward purple (“sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”) and stacked modifiers, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. A slightly sharper line-edit to trim a few over-ornate phrasings and lean harder on precise, concrete moments under peak beats would strengthen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally fluent and musical, with some striking images (“light…spilling into the air like liquid silver”). At times it edges toward purple, stacking abstractions and similar turns of phrase (“whispers of forgotten dreams,” “troubling serenity,” repeated invocations of “purpose” and “patterns”) without adding new information. Sentence rhythm is varied and mostly clear, though information density could be sharpened by trimming conceptual repetition. Line-level control is strong enough to carry the piece but not yet lean or surprising enough to stand out in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with good information density and minimal scaffolding; most sentences do at least two jobs (image + emotion, setting + theme). There’s some tendency toward purple or redundant abstraction (“thundering calm,” “weight of centuries,” “fiercely meditative presence”) but these don’t obscure clarity or causality. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the final paragraphs land with a clear, resonant image. Tighter pruning of repeated thematic language and occasional high-flown phrasing would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clean, well-paced, and syntactically varied, with few genuine clunkers or clarity issues. There is some repetition of conceptual language (balance, absolution, rhythm) and a tendency toward familiar lyric moves (whispering sea, hearts winding) that verge on the generic. Still, information density is decent, transitions are smooth, and the final image is clear despite a slightly purple, summarizing drift. Strong, publishable prose, though not yet razor-honed for maximal compression and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally smooth and rhythmic, with good sentence variety and clean mechanics. Some lines shade into purple or redundancy (“a scent he had grown to love,” “a story that deserved to be remembered”), and metaphors cluster in places without always deepening meaning. Still, momentum is not significantly harmed and most sentences do more than one job.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is smooth and readable, with generally clear syntax and some well-chosen images (the ink “shimmering like the lake’s surface”). However, there is noticeable repetition and scaffold (“He had not just written a future—he had written a call to action” / “He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it”) and several lines slip into familiar, almost slogan-like formulations. Figurative density is moderate but occasionally drifts toward purple, and some sentences restate ideas without adding pressure. For elite publication, the line-level work would need tightening and more originality per image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). There are some mildly purple touches and abstracted phrases (“the air vibrating with possibility”) that add color but don’t always carry new information. Redundancy is limited, and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. No major figurative muddle or scaffold artifacts interfere with clarity, though a tighter line edit could heighten impact by trimming a few near-duplicate ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished, grammatically sound, and mostly economical, with several strong images (ash dancing in the light, jagged mask edges catching the glow). Some lines pull double duty, advancing atmosphere and theme together. There is mild abstraction and repetition of similar concepts (“fragility,” “impermanence,” “mirage of safety”) without always adding new nuance, which slightly dulls momentum. Still, there are no major loops, metaphoric muddles, or artifacts that obscure clarity, and the closing image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly free of loops or clutter; sentences generally pull their weight for atmosphere or character. There’s some tendency toward abstract or slightly purple phrasing (“rationally rebellious mind,” “competing narratives that plagued his thoughts”), but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and exposition is reasonably compact. The main limitation is that line-level choices rarely surprise or compress multiple layers of meaning in a way that would elevate the piece to top-tier literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth, with varied sentence rhythms and strong sensory anchors at the beginning and in the library/rosette descriptions. Some lines show mild purple tendencies or abstraction—repeated use of “unlearning hatred,” “traveled stillness,” and concept-heavy sentences in the final paragraph—but they don’t significantly obscure meaning. There is a bit of redundancy around the library’s neglect and the arts’ vanishing status, which could be tightened for greater impact. Nonetheless, line-level craft is competent and occasionally elegant, if not yet at elite, cut-to-the-bone precision.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is cleanly copyedited, syntactically varied, and easy to read, with a decent balance of image, action, and interiority. Some metaphors and phrases feel generic or slightly purple, and a few lines explain what the scene already shows, but there’s no serious looping or muddle. Information density is adequate for this length: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or premise. The final paragraphs land clearly and are not dulled by line-level clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a smooth sentence rhythm and no major artifacts or loops. Some phrasing trends familiar (“heart raced,” “with a deep breath, she descended,” “erupted in light”), weakening originality at the line level. Expository passages about the drones’ purpose and sacrifice compress a lot of information into summary rather than image, slightly dulling momentum. Still, every paragraph advances either plot or atmosphere, and the closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and largely economical, with vivid yet not overbearing imagery and clean syntax. Many sentences multitask: advancing scene while sustaining tone and characterization. There is some mild repetition of abstractions (“hush,” “quiet,” “stillness”) and a few slightly ornamental phrases, but they do not significantly drag momentum or obscure sense. Line-level craft is strong and publication-ready, though not yet at a dazzling or risk-taking level.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, syntax varied, and most lines carry both image and thematic weight. There is some conceptual repetition (“time seemed to stand still,” “animate the lifeless,” several explicit restatements of purpose) that could be tightened. Figurative language is mostly controlled and coherent, with no major mixed metaphors or purple overload. The final third edges toward abstraction, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with varied sentence structures and paragraphs that each add either character, world, or thematic density; there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language (staircase as metaphor, equations as ghosts of failed motion) is consistent and not overmixed, and key sentences do multiple jobs at once. A few abstractions (“philosophical ideal,” “balancing daring”) and explicit restatements of theme slightly dull momentum, especially near the end. Overall, though, line-level craft is controlled and purposeful, comfortably publishable with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is mostly clean and purposeful, and there is little redundant scaffolding or syntactic monotony. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to blur clarity; the magical shift in atmosphere is easy to follow. The prose carries atmosphere and information efficiently, with minimal repetition and no major logical or grammatical slips. A bit more restraint in reiterating concepts (“lost language,” “smog”) could tighten it further, but the piece is already publication-ready at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and rich in sensory detail; images like “rosewater dread” and the lens making “shadows dance with life” are memorable. Sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious clutter. There are mild tendencies toward abstraction (“otherworldly energy,” direct labeling of fear and hope) and a few explanatory lines that repeat already implied insights, but they do not seriously impede momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense or mixed as to become purple or confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong images (“rocky spine exposed like the ribs of some ancient beast”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences do multiple jobs at once—setting mood, revealing character, and moving action. While there’s a mild tendency toward lush description, it rarely clogs clarity or momentum at this length. There are no substantial artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles that interfere with the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are generally clear, rhythmic, and purposeful, with vivid phrases like “photographically cursed” and “lingering luminance” creating a consistent atmospheric texture. While the prose occasionally edges toward purple (e.g., “its tone a repulsive allure that both repelled and fascinated her”), it does not collapse into muddle or repetitive scaffolding, and momentum is maintained. There are minimal paraphrase loops, and most lines do at least two jobs (world-building plus mood or theme). The main limitation is a slight overreliance on abstract or elevated formulations in peak beats instead of concrete, sensory embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and readable, with a comfortable rhythm and reasonably good information density. Imagery is clear and not muddled, and there are few genuine line-level errors. However, the language sometimes defaults to stock or near-stock formulations and mild redundancy, sacrificing sharpness for safe lyricism. It’s solid workmanlike craft with some pretty moments, but not line-for-line exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus interiority). Signature phrases like “sunwashed dread” are striking and help tone, though similar abstractions (“air thickened with dread”) verge on mild purple repetition. There is little scaffolding or synonym churn, and the sequence of actions is easy to follow. Sharpening a few generic emotional phrases into more concrete, character-specific perceptions would further elevate the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some effective images (“the truth is a seed, buried deep”) and well-structured paragraphs. There is noticeable abstraction and repetition in phrasing (“pit of lies,” “rescue truth,” “noble lies”) and occasional on-the-nose formulations that flatten texture. Figurative language is controlled rather than purple, but it doesn’t often pull double duty at sentence level. Line craft is solid, not yet sharpened to elite-literary edge.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly efficient, with a good balance of concrete image and elevated diction. There is some repetition of favored phrases and abstractions (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) that veers toward purple and occasionally tells what images already imply. Still, sentences carry multiple functions—advancing scene and atmosphere together—and momentum is not significantly stalled. The line-level craft is strong but not yet at a razor-honed, nothing-extra standard.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, with good rhythm and a strong sense of atmosphere, and it avoids major syntactic or clarity issues. Some phrases and constructions feel slightly over-decorated or repetitive (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve,” “tranquilly perceptive”), creating a mild sense of purple tint rather than precision. A few sentences summarize what the scene already implies, softening momentum and density. Nonetheless, line-level craft is above average and closure is not obscured by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong: varied syntax, clean mechanics, and images that pull double duty for atmosphere and emotion. Figurative language (“mist clung…like a lover’s whisper,” “luminous torment”) occasionally edges toward purple but remains intelligible and mostly purposeful. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most sentences either advance scene or deepen mood. Some abstract phrasing around grief could be further grounded, but line-level control is solid enough for immediate readability in a high-level venue.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with no major grammatical issues and a good balance between description and movement. There is some redundancy and mild purple drift—reiterating the hunt/potential/awakening triad and stacking modifiers like “bleak exhilaration” and “intangibly tangible”—but it doesn’t significantly obscure clarity. Most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion or theme), supporting momentum. Tightening abstractions and trimming reiterative lines would sharpen impact to a more elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is clear and mostly free of grammatical or syntactic errors, and each paragraph moves the story forward without egregious scaffolding. That said, the prose leans on stock formulations (“weight of history pressing down,” “beacon of knowledge,” “his heart raced”) and some mild redundancy (“brilliant dimness” repeated without deepening). Imagery tends to be competent rather than surprising, and sentence rhythm is relatively uniform. There are no serious artifacts, but also little compression or multi-function density typical of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythm, precise verbs, and images that carry multiple functions (mood, theme, and action) at once. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and not so dense as to obscure sense; phrases like “gnawing at him like a relentless tide” are conventional but serviceable. There’s minor redundancy in restating Elias’s guilt and the symbolism of the watch, yet momentum mostly holds. With a slight trim of repeated emotional summaries, this would be fully publication-ready line work.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with good control of sentence variety and few mechanical flaws. Some lines verge on purple or redundant thematic phrasing (“storm-worn windblown parapet,” repeated formulations of apology/forgiveness/neutrality) that add atmosphere but not always new information. Figurative language is mostly coherent and character-appropriate, and momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. Trimming a few abstractions and near-duplicate sentiments would sharpen the piece without altering its core.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, with strong sensory detail and a good balance between description and interiority. There are minor redundancies and slightly purple turns (“merrily melancholic,” “backlash of regrets”) but no major loops or mixed metaphors that slow momentum. Sentences usually do more than one job—advancing mood, character, and setting together. The closing image is clear and charged, though further tightening could strip a bit of abstraction from the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong—clean syntax, good rhythm, and images that often do double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the lake as “forgotten galaxy”). There are some familiar or slightly purple turns (“world was still broken, still cruel”; “jaded wonder”) and a few explanatory lines that paraphrase what’s already dramatized. Figurative language remains controlled enough not to muddle clarity, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or looping. Tightening some abstractions into more concrete, character-specific perceptions would raise the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are generally clear, well-structured, and free of grammatical issues, with a comfortable rhythmic variety. Some phrases lean on familiar fantasy idiom and metaphor (“weight of centuries,” “siren’s song,” “the orchard seemed to hold its breath”), but they don’t significantly obscure meaning or drag momentum. There’s minimal redundancy and good information density for the length. The line-level work is solidly publishable but not particularly sharp or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character—and few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Occasional purple flourishes are present but largely coherent and in-voice, and figurative language rarely tangles itself. Rhythm between longer lyric lines and shorter declaratives (“The light faded, leaving her alone in the glade once more.”) is well managed. Some metaphors and abstractions could be pared for even more sharpness, but they don’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clean, varied, and purposeful, with a good balance between description and progression; there’s little in the way of scaffolding or clumsy loops. Some phrases are a bit abstract or familiar (“gravity of sorrow,” “weight of forgotten pain,” “essence of compassion”), but they don’t seriously obscure meaning or momentum. The prose occasionally leans toward purple metaphor density, yet it remains readable and coherent, especially in the closing stitching sequence. Line-level craft is solidly publishable, though not yet razor-honed or surprising in its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with strong sensory images like toes sinking into black sand and sulfur-thick air. At the same time, several phrases recur or trend generic (“texture of transformation,” “vibrant hush,” “forever changing, and forever beautiful”), edging toward abstraction and softening momentum. The final paragraph in particular explains what images have already made legible, adding mild redundancy. Overall, it’s publishable-quality line work but not yet sharpened to maximal density and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some well-chosen phrases (“veil for something far more insidious”) and a steady rhythm. There are also several familiar turns of phrase and abstractions (“silent revolution,” “heart quickened,” “buzzed with newfound energy”) that feel generic for this register. Line-level redundancy is mild but present, and the emotional peaks are sometimes summarized rather than newly embodied. The writing is competent and smooth but not consistently sharp or compressed enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, fluid, and well-paced, with sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and forward motion) and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors and abstractions are overly familiar (“tapestry woven by time itself,” “until the tides ran dry”), nudging the work toward mild purple rather than sharp, idiosyncratic image. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and action ordering is clear at the climax despite the cosmic scale-up. Line-level craft is strong but stops short of the kind of startling precision expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is mostly lucid and well-shaped, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Some metaphor density and abstract phrasing (“something rarefy within them,” “storm-kissed wonder,” repeated formulations of truth and revelation) tip toward purple, but not to the point of obscuring sense. There is minor conceptual redundancy (multiple paraphrases of the same transformation) that could be slimmed for greater force. Overall, line-level control is solid and above-average, though not yet razor-honed for high-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are syntactically varied, mostly clean, and dense with information. The opening image (“dignified chaos,” fractured rainbows) is striking, and similar figurative touches recur with some elegance. At times the prose drifts into purple, with abstractions stacked on abstractions (“overture of existence,” “labyrinth of uncertainty”) that dilute impact rather than sharpen it. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, but pruning and grounding a few high-flown phrases would increase force.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluent and mostly lean, with good information density and few outright redundancies; sentences generally do double duty in atmosphere and character. Some phrasing verges on purple or repetitive (“blooming resistance,” “fractured darkness,” “luminous fractures”) but doesn’t seriously obscure sense. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and sequence clarity is solid. The closing paragraphs risk a minor abstraction loop—reiterating hope/resistance motifs rather than sharpening them—but momentum is not significantly harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean, grammatical, and generally well-paced, with most sentences doing at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus action). There are a few mild clichés and abstract locutions (“stir the soul,” “sense of anticipation”) and some reliance on stock emotional phrasing, but without major purple-prose clutter or loops. The prose supports the story smoothly rather than elevating it to a standout stylistic level.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and mostly concise, with a smooth read-aloud rhythm. Occasional purple or abstract phrases (“air shimmered with the promise of life,” “luminous doubt”) hover near cliché but do not seriously impede clarity. Information density is decent: most sentences pull some weight in atmosphere or premise-building, with limited redundancy. Line-level craft is solid but does not show the compression or surprising specificity that would stand out in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, largely efficient, and consistently clear, with most lines doing dual work (atmosphere plus character or theme). Metaphors and repetitions (“tides,” “color of unspoken apologies”) are patterned rather than accidental, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym churn. Some modifiers and images (“rhythmically placid melody,” “otherworldly light”) verge on purple but stop short of muddling sense. Rhythm and syntax support the contemplative pace without dragging.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is readable but cluttered with filtering verbs ("seemed," "felt," "noticed") that dilute immediacy. The reliance on abstract nominalizations ("reckoning," "humility," "essence") replaces concrete, active description.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("shadows danced," "silence hummed," "first rays... kissed," "mind racing"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and reduce the specific texture required for high-quality literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with creative writing clichés ("air hung heavy," "universe had held its breath," "ghost of sound," "canvas waiting to be filled").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.0)
    Line-level craft is marred by "telling" artifacts ("darkness, both literal and metaphorical") and scaffold phrasing ("With renewed purpose"). The prose frequently leans on stock imagery ("ethereal light," "tide receding") and logical slips (breath fogging a hot lantern or a cold lantern in a supposedly warm/dry bubble), preventing the density and precision needed for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by a high density of clichés ("dying fire," "beacon of hope," "weathered storms"). Several required phrases are shoehorned in as adverbs or awkward constructions ("sound was amplified quiet") that disrupt the rhythm and clarity of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché ("hush of twilight," "forgotten promises," "pure of heart"). Mixed metaphors and abstract phrasings ("foggy lucidity") obscure clarity, and the rhythm is repetitive, lacking the density and propulsion required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("defied logic," "shimmering," "ethereal light," "ancient whispers") and purple descriptors that obscure the image. The reliance on stock fantasy phrasing weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is functional but marred by significant clichés and filter verbs ("knew," "sought," "relied on their wits") that tell rather than show. The writing leans on summary to bypass complex actions, preventing immersion in the moment-to-moment reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but dense with adjective-noun pairings ("damp earth," "relentless pull," "fragile glass"). Several abstract phrases ("battered marvel of human experience," "silence shaped like a scream") tell the reader what to feel rather than showing the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt," "holding their breath"). Abstract telling replaces concrete showing, with emotional states summarized by labels like "yearning" and "purpose" rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is cluttered with awkward adverb-adjective clusters ("thoughtfully spirited precision") and "telling" summaries. The reliance on oxymorons like "weighty lightness" feels decorative rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("felt in her bones," "piece together the puzzle," "shattering into light") and abstract nouns that obscure specific imagery. The phrase "trembling certainty" is repeated verbatim, acting as a scaffold rather than a motif. Sentences often serve as stage directions or emotional labels rather than conveying active sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from scaffolded sequencing ("The first story...", "Next...", "The final story...") that creates a repetitive, list-like rhythm. Abstract phrasing ("sculpting the silence") often replaces concrete imagery, and reliance on adjectives weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("hold its breath," "threads in a tapestry," "everywhere and nowhere"). Reliance on abstract nouns ("energy," "truth," "existence") and weak verbs dilutes the imagery and impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive artifacts appear: the phrase "ambiguously clear" is used three times, and "resonant hush" three times, creating a distraction. The prose relies on abstract summarization ("tales of trust broken and rebuilt") rather than concrete imagery. These loops severely hamper flow.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("gnarled hands," "precision that belied their age," "testament to his patience"). The narrative relies on "as if" constructions and pathetic fallacy ("garden... whisper back... gratitude") rather than concrete imagery. Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("loomed like a metallic scar," "practiced precision," "knuckles whitening") and vague techno-babble ("dance of light and logic"). Prompt phrases like "mechanically warm" and "icy warmth" are repeated to the point of distraction, acting as scaffolds rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from heavy "telling" and scaffold phrases ("It was as if," "She felt a..."). Clichéd phrasing ("mind racing," "breath caught") dilutes the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished but repetitive, reusing prompt phrases ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow") as fixed labels. There is a tendency toward "scaffold" sentences that explain meaning immediately after an image ("It was a small loss, but it felt symbolic"). The rhythm is steady but lacks variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    Competent mechanics, but the prose suffers from stock phrasing ("shadows that danced like spectral figures") and a lack of rhythmic variety. The "drowsy alertness" insertion creates a jarring tonal contradiction with the established tension. Information density is low, with sentences often restating the atmosphere without advancing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "roots that resembled grasping hands," "silence their whispers") and purple abstractions ("scent of... forgotten memories"). These artifacts obscure the imagery and drain narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés and mixed metaphors; the required phrase "softly adaptive" is repeated awkwardly, creating a text artifact. The writing tells rather than shows ("cautious exuberance"), and the density of "poetic" modifiers obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is marred by repetitive phrasing ("probing," "bronze quiet," "displaced axis") and clunky adjectival clusters ("sensitively perceptive") that disrupt flow and weaken specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("woven into the fabric," "put their finger on," "beacon... cutting through the fog"). Abstract nouns replace concrete details ("air of mystery," "familiar enigma"). The reliance on passive descriptions and mixed metaphors ("orchestra," "lighthouse," "spycraft") muddles the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and "tell-heavy" explanations ("His method was through rhetorical devices"), obscuring the action. The reliance on oxymorons and high-concept jargon impedes clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by a dense stack of filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "seemed to echo," "seemed to pulse," "seemed to fill") which dulls immediacy. The imagery relies on clichés ("memories unraveling like threads of silk," "scent of rain on warm pavement") that fail to provide fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("ribbon of light," "unspoken questions," "spirit broken," "hollow eyes") that dull the imagery. Sentence rhythm is repetitive, often following a "Subject-Verb-Abstract Noun" pattern that lacks propulsion. The reliance on stock phrases prevents the emergence of a fresh, specific textual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("tear rolling down her cheek," "colors seemed brighter") and abstract telling ("Emotional numbness had become her constant companion"). The reliance on adjectives weakens the impact of the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is grammatically functional but saturated with clichés ("practiced precision," "symphony he knew all too well," "heart raced," "shrouded in darkness"). Information density is low, with the text often explaining emotions rather than evoking them through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from high cliché density ("voice thick with sorrow," "ghost he couldn't escape," "dissolving like mist"). Several mixed metaphors ("neon lights clashed with whispers") and abstract phrasing ("indescribably familiar") reduce impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by abstract metaphors and forced prompt insertions ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") that read as scaffold artifacts rather than organic description. These phrases interrupt the rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by stock phrasing and clichés ("tapestry of sound," "swallow sound," "dance of reflections"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("found herself drawn," "felt a strange warmth") that dulls immediacy. The rhythm is readable but lacks the freshness or density required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is polished but heavily reliant on adjectives and familiar similes ("like molten gold") that dampen immediacy. There is a lack of sentence-level propulsion, with rhythms settling into a predictable, descriptive cadence devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("hung in the air like a promise," "eyes lit up," "flowing as naturally as the breeze") that dull the imagery. The reliance on abstract adjectives and adverbs to convey emotion instead of concrete action weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is overwritten with abstract adjectives ("luminescent ache," "shimmering crater") and suffers from frequent filter verbs. The density of ornamentation obscures the lack of concrete action and sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.8)
    Line-level craft suffers from repetitive phrasing ("churned with urgency, as if urging") and cliché descriptors ("beckoned," "loomed"). The prose relies on scaffolding and telling rather than showing, with frequent use of abstract concepts in place of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but saturated with clichés ("heart of a vast," "racing with possibilities," "unravel the very fabric") and lacking in sensory specificity. High usage of scaffold phrases dissipates momentum, and the "dovetail" usage feels mechanically inserted to satisfy a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative suffers from a severe physical logic break (tape playing itself) and relies on cliché personification ("whispering secrets," "metallic veins"). Abstract nouns frequently replace concrete images, and the repetition of "sapphire hush" feels like a crutch rather than a motif.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with clichés and abstract phrasing ("solace in the chaos," "pulse with a life of its own," "living, breathing entity"). There is a heavy reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she couldn't shake the feeling") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The language attempts a poetic register but lands on melodramatic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is overwritten with clichés ("tapestry of parched lands," "ancient sentinels"). The repetition of the specific phrase "wryly earnest" for two different characters indicates a lack of control, and "haggard" is forced twice to meet prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("steadily unpredictable," "bright darkness") that create oxymorons and disrupt rhythm. The writing relies on telling ("magnify everyday magic") over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is serviceable but relies on clichés ("eyes like storm clouds," "weight of centuries") and abstract filter verbs. The integration of required phrases is clumsy (e.g., "hearten the very stones"), creating jarring semantic bumps that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose density is diluted by a high volume of clichés ("heart raced," "defied explanation," "mist... like a living thing"). The reliance on "trembling certainty" as a repeated descriptor acts as a text artifact that dulls the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is functional but saturated with clichés and filter verbs ("felt an inexplicable pull," "seemed to dance," "felt an urge"), which dilute immediacy. The reliance on abstract descriptors over concrete imagery results in a "tell, don't show" texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("moth to flame," "aching void," "brink of something monumental," "dying flame") that deaden the imagery. Abstract nouns replace concrete specifics, resulting in a lack of sensory immediacy. The writing relies on scaffolding ("His motivation was simple...") rather than letting action reveal intent.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by standard creative writing clichés ("mask of controlled frustration," "words caught in her throat"). The writing frequently "tells" the reader how to feel ("unsettling but not unwelcome") rather than evoking the sensation through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a lack of propulsion, relying heavily on "to be" verbs and modifier-noun pairs ("pale glow," "studious nature," "faint hum"). There are no significant line-level artifacts, but the density of adjectives and the passive sentence structures ("Elara’s method was meticulous") slow the pacing. The phrase "refracting the textures" is a mixed metaphor that blurs clarity rather than sharpening the image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is mechanically competent but weighed down by abstractions and clichés ("tapestry of lives," "simple yet profound"). Frequent [Adjective][Noun] pairings and telling-not-showing ("heart quickened") reduce textual density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("wind howled," "salty tang," "crumbling cliff," "sheer force of will," "fabric of her being"). These stock descriptors reduce freshness and specificity, creating a texture that feels assembled from common tropes rather than observed reality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("desperation," "resilience," "wonders") and familiar phrases ("fueled the fire," "loomed on the horizon"). Information density is low, with sentences summarizing emotional states rather than rendering them.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("breath fogging the visor," "heavy heart") and clunky repetition (the full phrase "nightwatch’s hourglass sand grain" appears three times). Adjective-noun pairings reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("groaning under the weight of destiny," "soul woven into every piece"). Cliché pairings (frantic traveler, delicate wings) and abstract nouns dilute the imagery. The logic break of "listening to... light... refraction" disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("shrouded in mystery," "storm of thoughts," "air hung heavy," "tears welled"). These artifacts flatten the specific texture of the scene and reduce emotional impact to standard templates.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on cliché and stock phrasing ("heart of a forgotten valley," "echoes of a bygone era," "weight of neglect"), resulting in a lack of freshness. While grammatically functional, the writing suffers from synonym churn and generic intensifiers that dull the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is riddled with clichés ("transcended time and space," "testament to," "essence of") and suffers from repetitive phrasing. Prompt terms are inserted awkwardly, often three times each, creating a "check-box" rhythm that disrupts flow. The phrase "attribute was to touch memories" reads like game mechanics rather than literary description.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is readable but occasionally overwritten with abstract phrasing ("lattice sustained impossibilities") that obscures meaning. The pacing is steady, but the reliance on "to be" verbs and static description in the middle section drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is weighed down by "purple" descriptors, clichés ("darkness... like a second skin"), and oxymoronic telling ("lovingly venomous") that obscures clarity. Mandatory phrases are inserted verbatim and awkwardly, disrupting rhythm and creating significant drag on the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant abstraction ("sew... hopes") and the repetitive insertion of prompt keywords ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") as labels. Clichéd phrasing ("moved with purpose") and mixed metaphors ("scent of... time") reduce line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("heart quickened," "trembling hands," "holding its breath") and filter verbs. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation and propulsion needed for a literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("heart quickened," "mind racing," "trembling hands," "shadows of progress"). Adjective stuffing ("soft, ethereal glow," "measured and deliberate") stifles momentum. Sentences frequently tell rather than show ("This was Lyra..."), creating a drag on the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("stood tall," "heart quickened," "deafening silence," "unseen hand") that dull the imagery. Frequent use of filter verbs ("she knew," "she wondered") creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is cluttered with adjective-noun pairings ("cryptic medium," "singing spirits," "fierce tenderness") that slow momentum. Abstract concepts are treated as concrete objects without sufficient grounding. The phrase "singing spirits" repeats four times in a short space, creating a distracting lexical loop.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("fragile peace," "jagged edges," "lotus-hearted ache"), creating a "purple" texture. The repetition of the opening phrase at the end feels mechanical rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of clichés ("whispering secrets," "forgotten era," "racing heart," "breathtaking"). Phrases like "strange warmth" and "eerie landscape" are low-information descriptors that occupy space without adding specificity or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a glaring grammatical error ("worked methodically playful") resulting from a forced prompt insertion. Reliance on filter verbs and stock phrases ("voice a chorus of whispers," "exploding into life") further dilutes the line-level impact and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("spoke volumes," "knowing smile," "encroaching darkness") and repetitive sentence structures ("It was in...", "It was here..."). Overwriting in descriptions ("candidly cryptic") reduces clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("sands of time," "not in vain," "wink in approval") and filter verbs ("seemed to" appears five times), which create distance. The reliance on summary and abstract phrasing prevents any immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.4)
    Sentence structure suffers from a repetitive "As [clause], [main clause]" template (used four times to open key beats). Adverb-adjective clusters ("gently systematic grace") and cliché similes ("like crystalline tears") weaken the prose's density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("dust motes danced," "teetering on the edge," "heart light for the first time") and abstract metaphors that obscure physical action. Reliance on oxymorons ("carefully reckless," "cautious exuberance") as descriptors creates vagueness rather than complexity. The high frequency of "telling" via abstract nouns ("essence," "patterns," "intentions") saps narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose density is low due to abstract filtering and adjective stuffing. The text relies on cliché constructions ("time when gods and mortals," "palpable heat") and repeats prompt phrases awkwardly. The logic of the sentences often drifts into abstraction to accommodate the required elements, weakening clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with cliché adjective-noun pairings ("dimly lit," "chaotic patterns," "unseen hand") and "purple" abstractions that blur the physical reality. Information density is low, with sentences frequently restating the mood or abstract concepts ("balance," "void") without advancing plot or image clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe repetitive loop artifact is present: the specific phrase "fractured hush" appears three times (paragraphs 3, 5, and 7) in a very short text, flattening the prose. Additionally, reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is marred by the repetitive misuse of the phrase "softly ingenious" (applied to both a lantern and a hand), creating a glaring artifact. Phrasing often drifts into cliché ("laughter echoing through the halls") or catachresis ("captivate the moment") that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose relies on clichés ("sand slipping through her fingers," "key to something greater") and repeats the forced oxymoron "cheerful gloom" without earning the nuance. Frequent filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on scaffolding transitions ("As the act progressed," "The climax came when," "In the end") which disrupt immersion. Clichés abound ("hum of daily life," "wove... into a narrative," "magic could happen"), and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("unexpected beauty," "calculated randomness") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is purple and adjective-heavy ("bled into the night," "miniature galaxy suspended in glass"). The prompt phrase "rare moonstone cabochon dust speck" is inserted as a clunky noun stack that disrupts rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is overwritten with "purple" descriptors ("kissed," "danced," "whisper") and relies heavily on filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt," "He believed") that dull immediacy. There are significant "template cadence" artifacts, with many sentences following a repetitive Subject-Verb-Abstract Object structure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is laden with stock phrases ("echoed in his dreams," "weight... evaporated") and abstract metaphors that lack density. The forced oxymoron "hard softness" and the repetitive "celestial bodies" phrasing disrupt the rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by abstractions and purple phrasing ("oceanic caress," "whisper of the tide") that obscures concrete action. There is significant "concept looping" where the same idea about hope and patterns is restated multiple times without progression. The line-level craft prioritizes ornamental adjectives over strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is functional but prone to "purple" modifiers and clichés ("breathing with the whispers," "tendrils curling like fingers"). There is a reliance on abstract nouns (legacy, history, dreams) over concrete particulars. The pacing is smooth, but the sentence structure lacks the variety or rhythm to heighten the tension during the discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("hummed with the promise of renewal," "shimmered like a dream," "world held its breath"). Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery ("swirling possibilities," "weaves illusions"). Phrasing is often functional but ornamental, lacking density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("beacon of hope," "weight of her mission," "cycle of violence") and abstract nouns. Prompt phrases are inserted clumsily as adjectives ("operatively gentle approach"), disrupting the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from cliché density ("moved with purpose," "lost to time," "guarded fiercely," "trembling hands") and modifier overuse. Information is often conveyed through summary and labeling rather than concrete, active phrasing, slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from abstract metaphors and awkward phrasing ("bodily poetic grace," "alarming serenity") that appear to be forced insertions. Clichés like "heart pounding" and "intuition she couldn't explain" dilute the line-level quality and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("fresh wind blowing," "silent witnesses," "flickering flames") and abstract modifiers that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Subject [verb], [participial phrase]" pattern. The prompt phrases ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on modifier-heavy constructions ("transiently rooted," "esoteric realist") that obscure physical reality. Clichés ("forgotten dream," "haunting whisper") dilute the imagery, and the repetition of "blushing stillness" and "interrupted cadence" reads as loop artifacts rather than intentional motifs. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high cliché density ("whispered secrets," "weight of its own sorrow," "time seemed to stand still"). While grammatically functional, the reliance on mixed metaphors and purple descriptors ("technical gentleness," "snowmelt ardor") obscures clarity and dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.2)
    A severe "template cadence" issue exists with repetitive sentence openers ("As the storm approached," "As the wind howled," "As the hours passed," "As the storm reached"). The prose relies on clichés ("vines curled like serpents") and abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.5)
    Heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("dusky harmony," "covenant," "schematic representations") constitutes significant text artifacting and looping, damaging flow and density.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean but relies heavily on "telling" abstractions ("resentment palpable," "mission accomplished") and clichés ("hardened into a shell," "glimmer of hope"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjectival clutter and cliché ("eyes like polished obsidian," "dissolved like mist"). There is a tendency toward "purple" description ("delicate as glass mountains," "rhythm of the cosmos") that reduces immediacy and creates a barrier to engagement. Sentence rhythm is often monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but dense with adjective-noun pairings ("verdant sanctuary," "chaotic beauty") and abstract nouns that slow momentum. Frequent use of filtering verbs ("She realized," "she hoped," "she knew") distances the reader from the protagonist's direct experience of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically competent but suffers from "telling" emotional states and forced adjective-noun pairings like "brightened disquiet." The reliance on abstract descriptors ("simply complicated," "inexplicable") dilutes the sensory immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from clichéd pairings ("fabric of reality," "shadowed depths") and oxymoronic filler ("simple yet intricate"). The repetition of the phrase "carefully resourceful" as a character tag acts as a visible artifact that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("groaning under the weight of forgotten dreams") and awkward phrasing forced by prompt insertion ("unkindled solace" reads as nonsensical in context). The line-level execution tells rather than shows, utilizing abstract nouns over concrete verbs. There is a lack of rhythmic variety, contributing to a sluggish pace despite the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" and repetitive phrasing; "translate confusion into clarity" and "warmly methodical" are repeated verbatim as scaffolding. The text relies on abstract nouns and clichés ("tapestry of connections," "whisper fables," "symphony") instead of concrete imagery. The density of "to be" verbs and expository sentence structures ("Her task was...", "Her motivation was...", "Her approach was...") kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on adverbs and abstract telling ("peculiar but precise," "thick with tension," "motivation was clear"). The required phrase "gently luminous" is repeated verbatim in the climax, creating a lexical loop. The reliance on explanation over dramatization slows the momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("chaos reigned," "pulse with life," "defied logic," "worked tirelessly") and abstract summaries of emotion. There is a lack of sensory immediacy, with the narrative often telling the reader what is significant rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is often overwritten and dependent on clichés ("heart quickened," "rippled like water," "deliberate grace"). The density of adjectives and "purple" descriptors slows the reading speed without adding informational value or specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("hollow eyes," "thick with anticipation," "laughter like a floodgate") and abstract metaphors ("gravity of hopelessness") that deaden the impact. Filter verbs and purple phrasing distance the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("celestial tapestry," "holding its breath," "wink in approval") and abstract nouns. Sentence structures are repetitive ("As she turned...", "As the stars..."). The high density of filter verbs and telling ("Her motivation was singular") flattens the impact and violates the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=3.9)
    Forced inclusion of prompt phrases ("tone stretching contracted," "intangibly tangible") results in semantic breaks and syntactical awkwardness. The prose relies heavily on clichés ("heart pounded," "fears melting away") and filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.1)
    Line-level craft is marred by "thesaurus-itis" and awkward phrasing ("catalyze a change," "sieve for the mind") that obscures clarity. The prose relies on adjectival density over concrete nouns, creating a vaporous texture without impact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("weight of history," "countless trials," "blinding point of light"). The forced inclusion of "sally" creates a semantic break, and the imagery often leans into purple abstraction rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-noun pairings and clichés ("encroaching darkness," "suffocating grip," "ancient power"). The phrase "loaded emptiness" feels inserted to satisfy a requirement rather than arising organically from the scene's rhythm. There is a tendency toward summary ("Her motivation was clear") over dramatization, which stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by "purple" abstractions and awkward phrasing ("shadowseam wonder") that muddies clarity. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings to convey wonder replaces concrete imagery, and the text frequently summarizes action that should be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is laden with purple descriptors ("first yawn of evening," "forgotten dreams") that obscure clarity for the sake of forced atmosphere. There are repetitive phrasing artifacts—specifically the awkward reuse of "eloquently silent"—that disrupt the flow. The writing relies on clichés ("hushed tones," "weight as a promise") rather than fresh, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-heavy descriptions and clichés. The phrase "factually mystical light" reads as a logic error or forced artifact, and "shivering bliss" relies on abstract labeling rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("heart quickening," "breath caught") and abstract descriptions. The line-level logic of the "dust patterns" (tiny footprints leading to a button on a shelf) creates confusion rather than clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("satisfying click," "heart pounding," "slipped into the shadows," "ghost in the machine"). Line-level logic is weak (the puddle map), and the vocabulary choice "suffixed" is a significant error. The writing relies on stock phrasing rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("forgotten memory," "threads of silk," "glistened like diamonds," "veil of silence"). Purple phrasing ("muffling the world in its damp embrace") obscures clarity. There is a high density of filter verbs and repetitive sentence structures that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("felt," "realized") and awkward, prompt-forced phrasing ("mossy delight that tinged"). The repetition of the clunky object name ("moonstone cabochon dust speck") creates a rhythmic stumble without poetic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is readable but thinned by clichés ("withered to skeletons," "danced in the drafts") and abstract labeling ("inexplicable pull"). The reliance on adjectives over concrete verbs reduces density, and the "template cadence" of the action beats slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from abstraction ("fabric of existence") and "purple" phrasing ("silent challenge"). Specific phrases like "factually mystical blend" and "luminous regret" read as awkward prompt insertions that degrade clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "adjective stuffing" and abstract constructions ("luminous ache," "modestly fearless," "spectral confessions") that prioritize decoration over clarity. The text relies on telling emotions through labels ("desperate kind of hope," "voice trembling") rather than evoking them through action. These "text artifacts" clog the momentum and reduce the immediacy of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("light at the end of the tunnel" equivalent, "pain into purpose") and abstract phrasing that obscures imagery. There is a high frequency of "telling" rather than showing ("Elara’s motivation was clear"). The writing suffers from "purple prose" artifacts, prioritizing sounding poetic over conveying concrete action or observation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("dreams distilled into vials," "unfasten its hidden story"). Phrase-level artifacts from the prompt ("elusively tangible") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the logical flow. Repetitive sentence structures (Noun-Verb or "Lila [verb]") create a mechanical rhythm that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("dissipating like smoke," "heart pounding," "sprang to life") and adjective-noun scaffolding ("once-vibrant facade," "methodical approach"). The attempt at technical specificity ("analyze the dust accumulation patterns") clashes with the immediate pivot to magical results, weakening the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is laden with stock phrases ("fingers danced," "heart quickened") and filter verbs that distance the reader. A significant tautological error appears in "clouds enveloped her, their softness cradling her like a cradle," which disrupts the reading flow. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose suffers from frequent clichés ("fever pitch," "tears streamed," "unravel secrets") and purple abstractions ("torrents of luminescence"). The reliance on summary creates a lack of momentum and density in the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and mixed metaphors (e.g., "gears wilting near dishonesty," a category error). Rhythms are repetitive, and the imagery leans heavily on clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.2)
    The text suffers from a high density of clichés ("ghost of its former self," "blank canvas," "silent sentinels," "life found a way") that dilute literary quality. Sentences often function as scaffolding for the next plot beat rather than offering fresh imagery or rhythmic propulsion. The sensory descriptions of "rust and rain" feel formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose suffers from "purple" over-description and clunky abstract phrasing inserted to meet prompt requirements. Repetitive sentence structures and filter verbs dilute immediacy, while phrases like "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read as unnatural intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("love, loss, and longing," "melt into the earth like a sigh," "soul of a place"). High density of abstract nouns and stock metaphors weakens the imagery. The writing relies on "purple" descriptors rather than concrete verbs and specific nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("ancient and knowing," "golden glow") and mixed metaphors ("shadow stretching like a dark whisper"). The "tone of her reverie was searing" is a particularly weak tell that abstracts emotion instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("shadow of its former self," "rise from the ashes," "resting on her laurels," "windows like empty eyes"). Telling replaces showing throughout, reducing engagement and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is functional but laden with stock phrases ("heart of the city," "pierced the clouds," "lost to time"). High cliché density flattens the imagery and prevents specific, fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract phrasing ("texture of borrowed time") and clichés ("hold its breath"). The oxymoron "furiously tranquil" is inserted as a modifier without the supporting behavioral detail to make it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("heart quickened," "point of no return," "time itself were slowing") and scaffold phrases that explain action rather than showing it. Prompt elements appear as clunky labels ("credibly curious nature") that disrupt the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy "adjective-itis" ("primal elegance," "skeletal frame," "fleeting beauty," "infinite void"), creating a dense, purple texture that slows momentum. Clichés abound ("dawn broke," "constant companion"), and the reliance on telling over showing ("she realized the lantern wasn’t just an object") drains the scenes of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.6)
    Writing suffers from heavy cliché usage ("testament to resilience") and a jarring register break ("contextual clues") that disrupts the mythic tone and creates opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("nestled," "bustling affair," "testament to its endurance") and abstract phrasing that dulls the imagery. There is a lack of concrete detail; "energy" and "warmth" are used as repetitive catch-all descriptors for the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is marred by filter verb stacks ("seemed to shift," "seemed to understand") and clunky repetition ("warmly attentive nature/spirit"). Clichés like "shimmered like a mirror" and purple phrasing ("weave words into dawns") obscure clarity and reduce impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose relies on clichés ("bridge between worlds," "testament to the harmony") and repetitive labeling; the phrase "brazen calm" is inserted three times as a static descriptor. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation or density required for high-quality literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by noticeable repetition loops, specifically the phrases "bronze quiet" and "luminous skeptic," which appear multiple times without accumulation of meaning. Abstract phrasing ("paradoxical blend of decay and renewal," "whispers of the past") replaces concrete imagery, reducing information density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("scars of war," "whispers of hope," "vastness of eternity") and abstract nouns. The rhythm is sluggish, often utilizing a "noun-heavy" structure that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies on clichés ("sun bled," "stirred like embers catching flame") and abstract telling ("intuitively descriptive") instead of concrete action. Sentence structures are repetitive ("He took," "He placed," "He found"), creating a plodding rhythm that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is laden with adjective-noun clichés ("silent testament," "patina of neglect," "ancient dance") and repetitive phrasing ("echoed silence" appears twice). The reliance on abstract telling over concrete showing stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("heart raced," "hours turned to moments," "unyielding determination"). There is a lack of sensory specificity, and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("wonders and dangers") dilutes the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and "purple" descriptions ("nomadic penumbra," "weight of forgotten conversations") instead of concrete imagery. Information density is low regarding actual events, replaced by philosophical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but dense with clichés ("groaning under the weight," "time to confront"). The integration of prompt words (like "seed") feels mechanical, disrupting the rhythm. The narrative tells rather than shows, summarizing complex emotional shifts in broad, abstract sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies ("winnow the soul," "testament to countless games") and awkward phrasings like "fidgeted productively." Repetitive use of prompt phrases ("woven hush") draws attention to the scaffolding rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with modifier-heavy metaphors ("skeletal fingers," "innocently mischievous," "ethereal colors") that clutter the imagery. There is a reliance on telling ("words were raw, unpolished") instead of allowing the quality of the speech to stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.5)
    Forced insertion of prompt phrases results in severe grammatical errors ("to quilts memories," "memories quilts together"). Sentence structure is repetitive, frequently relying on "As [clause]" openings to drive transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose density is low, weighed down by a high frequency of clichés ("woven together," "testament to," "golden glow") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on familiar metaphors ("waves whispered") and adverbs ("intimately," "carefully") obscures concrete detail and deadens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies on abstract nouns and "telling" over "showing" ("essence of night," "quiet strength," "power in subtlety"). The phrase "screaming tenderness" appears as a forced oxymoron that disrupts the rhythmic flow, and "vibrations of intent" reads as pseudo-profound abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose relies on abstract nouns ("ingenuity," "sanctuary") and labeled emotions rather than concrete imagery. The phrase "raw solace" is repeated as a text loop (para 4, para 8), indicating a forced insertion of the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing, specifically the reuse of "fractured grace" in the first, middle, and final paragraphs, which reads as a scaffold artifact. Some descriptions rely on stock phrasing ("clamped his mouth shut," "heart pounding" implied via "chill") rather than fresh sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    Functional prose is marred by distinct clichés ("clung to him like a second skin," "unwavering purpose," "sea and sky blurred into one"). The prompt attribute "softly persistent" is repeated verbatim as a tag, creating a noticeable scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Sentence structure is repetitive and scaffold-heavy ("Elias noticed," "Elias felt," "As he..."). The prose relies on filter verbs and "telling" constructions ("Elias was empirically intuitive") that distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is marred by the mechanical repetition of forced phrases ("lacy menace," "softly commanding," "shared exhale") which appear twice each in short succession, creating noticeable artifacts. The "lacy menace" phrase is particularly disruptive, used awkwardly as a noun phrase that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from abstract overwriting ("fragment of a forgotten star," "scientifically romantic heart") that prioritizes sound over clarity. Key moments are summarized rather than dramatized, and the reliance on adjective-heavy description slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with clichés and stock similes ("struck her like a lightning bolt," "shattered mirror," "laughter echoing like chimes," "fingers brushing against eternity"). "Feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" are repeated as fixed phrases. The writing leans toward purple prose rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is overwritten and heavily abstract ("breath of ancient mechanisms," "relic of life’s most ordinary miracles"). It relies on filter verbs ("sensed," "felt") and mixed metaphors rather than concrete imagery. Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("glinting faintly," "shimmer like frost," "chapters in the story") and abstract noun-heavy phrasing. There is a lack of concrete, sensory specificity; the "adjective-noun" pairing is repetitive and often generic ("saturated hush," "bitter brew," "renewed determination").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is functional but saturated with clichés ("lingered like smoke," "held breath," "whispered secrets," "wrapped around her like a shawl"). These "scaffold" phrases reduce the story's vividness and impact. The density of stock metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving the freshness required for high-band literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentences are grammatically sound but burdened by abstract nouns and filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "seemed to rearrange," "witness knew"). The prose tells the reader the significance of events rather than showing them through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is serviceable but relies on clichés like "relentless march of time," "heart pounded," and "endless possibility," which dilute the imagery. The phrase "fjord quiet" is a highlight, but the line-level rhythm lacks the propulsion needed to elevate the low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies on purple descriptors ("quiet wildfire," "echo") and repetitive bookending; the "spatially gifted mind" phrase is a clunky expository artifact that disrupts line-level rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("flickering like a heartbeat," "flowing like a river breaking through a dam") and nonsensical similes ("scent that clung... like a forgotten memory"). The writing prioritizes ornamental flow over precision and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by clichés ("forgotten promise") and scaffold sentences that explain plot mechanics ("He realized then that the disc wasn’t just an object"). The frequent use of filter verbs dampens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from clichéd imagery ("frozen in time," "sight to behold") and grammatical awkwardness forced by prompt constraints ("worked gently thorough" instead of "thoroughly"). Phrasing like "steep herself in its history" and "explore through proximate causes" reads as mechanical insertion of required terms rather than natural syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.9)
    While grammatically competent, the prose is laden with clichés ("leafy embrace," "rebellion against the stillness," "air of mystery"). Abstract nouns frequently replace concrete imagery, and the final phrase ("polite anarchy") feels tonally disconnected from the preceding text.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies ("fingers danced," "liquid silence," "quiet blaze") and reliance on clichés ("bread crumbs," "tapestry of her life"). Descriptions often tell rather than show, using abstract nouns ("determination," "truths") in place of concrete imagery. Information density is low, with many sentences restating the emotional premise without advancing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("time seemed to fold," "world held its breath") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader. The prompt phrase "thresh meaning from experience" is inserted mechanically in the exposition and conclusion, feeling forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is laden with abstractions ("presence," "power," "meaning") and tired metaphors ("tapestry of emotion," "symphony"). The writing tells the reader the significance of events ("every gesture... was a note") instead of showing the sensory reality of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from purple phrasing ("volcanic tenderness") and oxymoronic labels ("analytically intuitive") that appear repeatedly. Line-level logic is weak (identifying brushstrokes on a tapestry), and the reliance on abstract nouns prevents vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is cluttered with filter verbs ("she noticed," "she decided," "she felt") and strained metaphors ("hush of the universe inhaling") that obscure immediacy. The reliance on adjective-heavy abstraction ("auroral sorrow") reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is readable but relies on clichés ("heart of a sprawling city," "sharp tongue," "eyes daring them"). The insertion of prompt phrases results in logical artifacts (turning a key with "calculated spontaneity" is a contradiction in terms). The final paragraph devolves into a list-summary of items ("The zodiac coin, the folded map, the key") to force relevance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is marred by awkward adverbs ("spiralingly calm" is jarring) and clichéd similes ("tumbles out like pebbles"). The reliance on abstract nouns ("presence," "tension," "peace") to tell the reader what to feel weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and weak modifiers ("inexplicable pull," "subtleties of the world"), lacking density and propulsion. Repetitive phrasing ("quiet," "wonder," "seeds") and clichéd metaphors ("universe was conspiring," "holding its breath") flatten the rhythm and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is polished but saturated with clichés and stock phrases ("precision of a dancer," "deep and resonant," "guarded heart"). There is a reliance on "scaffold" adjectives that tell rather than show, and the rhythm is lulled by a predictable cadence that lacks propulsion during the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is weighed down by abstractions ("vibrancy," "unyielding grip," "emotional void") and telling ("dramatically narrated"). The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, and the reliance on adjective-noun pairings reduces the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("fabric of reality," "lullaby for the soul") and filter verbs ("felt a tremor," "felt the past") that dull immediacy. Adjective-noun pairings are predictable ("frozen lake," "soft whisper," "smooth surface"), and the reliance on abstract nouns strips the climax of visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("symphony of grays," "captured rainbows") and poeticisms that reduce immediacy. While grammatically clean, the reliance on worn similes and abstract descriptors ("fragile beauty") prevents the specific freshness required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("Elara’s attention was drawn," "Elara heard"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience. Figurative language is often cliché ("symphony of whispers," "glow with a life of its own").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies on adjective-heavy telling ("quiet corners," "subdued ardor," "delicate mourning bands") rather than concrete action, slowing momentum. Cliché imagery ("scent of blooming flowers") and summary labels ("renewed determination") replace the dramatization of the character's internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is laden with "purple" descriptors ("digital pulse," "liquid patterns") and prompt-phrase insertions that disrupt flow ("steadily curious" as a direct label). The metaphor of the measuring tape is mixed and literalized awkwardly, creating confusion about the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("shadows danced") and abstract nominalizations that distance the reader. Heavy use of filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") and purple descriptors ("shimmered with hues") dilutes immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.7)
    The phrase "softly deliberate" is repeated three times (paras 2, 6, 8), creating a distracting template artifact. The prose relies on weak similes and hedging ("seemed to," "as though") which dilutes agency and clarity. Abstract phrasing ("shimmered like captured sunsets") prioritizes ornamentation over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is heavily overwritten ("shimmering stillness," "fragile convictions," "quietly vivid"), creating a dense thicket of modifiers that obscures the action. There are significant loops, including the repetition of "shimmering stillness" and "quietly vivid," and the reliance on clichéd metaphors ("peeling away like old paint") degrades line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("heart quickened," "fragments of memories") and forced phrasing like "meteor hush." Repetitive sentence structures and a reliance on abstract nouns prevent the writing from achieving the density and propulsion required for this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but leans heavily on clichés ("whisper of history," "time capsule," "walls humming"), which dulls the imagery. While grammatically clean, the sentence rhythm is uniform, and "telling" often replaces "showing" in key moments of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive adjective-noun pairings ("ever-shifting sky," "distant melodies") and clichés. The reliance on abstract nouns reduces information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is readable but relies on scaffolding and clichés ("eternal pause," "thin air," "pulsing with life"). Information density is low, with many sentences devoted to explaining backstory or mechanics that could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with stock phrases and worn imagery ("heart of the," "puzzle/whole picture," "trembling hands," "symphony of ideas"). These artifacts dilute the imagery and reduce the emotional impact, while the reliance on abstract nouns ("insight," "clarity," "beauty") violates the "show, don't tell" principle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from a high density of stock similes ("eyes like polished stones," "mist... like a second cloak," "like a curtain") and abstract phrasing ("scent of... secrets"). The climactic action ("punched the air") is imprecise, risking a comedic misreading (a fist-pump) rather than clearly conveying the intended magical self-stamping.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is dominated by static "was/were" constructions and scaffolding ("It was here that," "It was a duty"), which saps momentum. The reliance on passive description prevents the scene from achieving necessary density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from purple abstractions ("forgotten light," "pause of shifting constellations") and clunky repetition of the phrase "regally unpretentious." These artifacts obscure clarity and create a stilted rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by clichéd phrasing ("sentinel," "quiet efficiency") and awkward integration of prompt elements ("Periodically eternal, the oceans seemed to remind her" is grammatically strained). The writing often relies on scaffolding ("She began to assemble fragments," "A practice of... that had become her way") rather than immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "telling" over "showing" (e.g., "Lira’s motivation was clear") and relies on cliché phrasing ("shook her to her core," "darkest of times"). Adjective stacking ("dim, amber glow," "silent giants") slows momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by pervasive filtering ("Mara knew," "Mara could feel," "Mara opened her eyes to see") which distances the reader. Clichéd similes ("vanished like a shadow," "symphony of hope") and melodramatic phrasing reduce line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("stark contrast," "crumpled photograph," "time seemed to stand still," "wounded bird"). Abstract phrasing often replaces concrete imagery, reducing immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is marred by purple phrasing ("luminescent pulse," "spectral presence") and a reliance on clichés ("beacon of hope," "fragments of a reality"). "Luminescent ache" is a mixed metaphor that obscures meaning rather than illuminating it. High filter-verb density ("She realized," "She thought") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés and abstract modifiers ("uncanny precision," "ancient and profound," "silvery light"). Sentence structures often fall into a template cadence, and the reliance on adjectives weakens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.7)
    The text suffers from severe repetition of specific phrases ("dizzying quiet," "unspoken conversation," "contraband truths") multiple times, creating a jarring, artificial cadence. Clichés abound ("ticking clock," "storm of conflicting emotions"), and the prose lacks density.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is smooth but saturated with clichés ("barren wasteland," "stark contrast," "gruff but not unkind," "long shadows," "refused to let fear take root"). Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery ("sanctuary of peace," "values of resilience"), and the montage transition ("As the days passed") kills narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but cluttered with abstract nouns, clichés ("symphony of silence"), and forced usage of prompt terms ("transliterated"). The reliance on contradictory adjectives ("feral, yet soothing") to describe atmosphere creates a lack of precision, and the sentence rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "web of deceit," "burning brighter than her fear," "cutthroat world") and purple phrasing ("whispers of the wind"). Sentence structures are repetitive and rely on scaffolding ("As the day wore on," "As she stood"), and the "solemn playfulness" is stated as a label rather than executed in the line-level style.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is grammatically competent but saturated with abstract metaphors and clichés ("word felt like a dagger," "irreversible consequences"). The reliance on "telling" over "showing" flattens the emotional impact, and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from the repetitive and awkward use of "interjected" (three times), including a usage error where a physical object is "interjected" into sand. Abstract nouns and adjectival clutter ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") replace strong verbs and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract nouns and "tell" artifacts ("gentle radicalism," "very essence"). Phrases from the prompt are pasted in awkwardly ("retrocognitively trapped") without blending into the sentence rhythm. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw," "seemed to") distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is overwritten with stacked modifiers and clichés ("petals unfurling like secrets," "brink of despair"). The critical continuity error regarding the coin's location undermines the story's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt phrases ("fractally precise," "somatic markers") which appear as inserted artifacts rather than integrated language. The writing is abstract and overly adjectival, frequently telling the reader what to feel rather than showing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("heart racing," "pounding with anticipation," "flooded her mind"). Emotional beats are summarized with abstract labels rather than shown through concrete behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract "purple" phrases ("unearthed silence," "raw possibility") and relies heavily on filter verbs that dull immediacy. Metaphors are often mixed or vacuous ("spin a prophecy," "unscrambling the echoes that clung"), creating a smooth surface with little informational density.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is dense with stock similes ("like a forgotten veil," "like the scars," "like a canvas," "like a push"). The reliance on "telling" ("Elara’s motivation was clear") and abstract phrasing ("promise of fixing what’s broken") stalls momentum. Several prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from high abstraction density ("distill complexity," "percolate through the air") which obscures concrete imagery. Prompt phrases like "spindrift serenity" and "ambient awareness" are inserted as explanatory labels rather than woven into the action. The word "percolate" is repeated metaphorically, reducing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vocabulary repetition is an issue, with "thrum" appearing five times in a short space. The prose leans on abstract nouns ("essence," "hope," "compassion") rather than concrete imagery to carry the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with phrases like "quivering hush" and "rhythm of oars in water" repeated verbatim three times in a short space. Clichés abound ("shimmered like a mirror," "eyes meeting hers"), and density is low due to frequent filter verbs and explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically functional but suffers from overwriting and abstract descriptors that dull immediacy. The required phrase "brittle awakenings" is inserted awkwardly, and "atomically reflective" reads as a scientific artifact in a fantasy context.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from reliance on clichés ("washed clean," "mended broken hearts," "kindled new flames") and abstract descriptors. Information density is low, with many sentences devoted to explaining the significance of actions rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("room seemed to hold its breath," "ethereal glow," "unraveling into chaos") and filter verbs that distance the reader. The reliance on stock phrases flattens the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose contains several clichés ("swallow her whole," "veil between realms," "mind racing") that dull the imagery. The simile comparing the compass's reverberation to a church organ is clunky, especially when the organ later appears as a literal auditory element.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, heavily reliant on abstract nouns and adjectival phrasing ("emotional landscapes," "fragile thread to the truth"). Clichés like "ghostly shroud" and "mind worked like a clockwork mechanism" dull the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant lexical artifacts mar the prose; specific phrases like "nervously confident" and "spongey dread" are repeated verbatim, creating a loop effect. The inclusion of doggerel verse ("speak the name...") lowers the tonal density.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("vanished without a trace," "bathed in... light") and awkward integration of required phrases ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"). These elements read as forced insertions that disrupt the narrative flow and textural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("fleeting dream," "turned to ashes") and a high density of filter verbs ("remembered," "felt," "realized"). Key prompt phrases are shoehorned in as modifiers rather than integrated organically.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    A high density of clichés ("river of light," "tapestry of hope," "whispered secrets") and abstract metaphors obscures specific imagery; the prose relies heavily on telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is functional but suffers from adjective stacking ("small, unassuming seed," "soft, moss-covered ground") and abstract noun clusters. The climax relies on describing energy and confessions rather than concrete, sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("defied logic," "ripples on water," "resolve hardening") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew"). The specific phrase "anxious elation" is repeated verbatim in paragraphs 1 and 4, indicating a lack of lexical control. Figurative language is often stock or vague.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    Phrasing is frequently awkward or abstract ("inlaying meaning everywhere," "patch holes in the soul") and struggles to integrate prompt words naturalistically ("dusky with resolve"). The prose relies on telling and summary, with several clichés ("heart pounded," "knowing smile") weakening the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("thundered like a storm," "danced like ghosts," "scar on the earth") and filter verbs that distance the reader. High occurrence of "purple" descriptors prevents immediacy; the "deep breath" to signal resolution is a stock gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("pulse with life," "wave of understanding," "far from over") and abstract nouns. The reliance on stock phrases prevents vivid, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("ebb and flow," "dance of light and shadow," "tapestry of opposing threads") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are competent but repetitive, often following a "Description, then Reflection" pattern that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose relies on stock phrases ("ancient secrets," "stories untold") and repeats prompt-specific phrasing ("resonant hush," "heartbeat of a hesitation") awkwardly at the beginning and end. The writing tells rather than shows, using heavy-handed adjectives instead of strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level craft is marred by a distractingly non-standard word or typo ("gleezing") in the hook and pervasive clichés ("shattered windows in golden beams," "weight on her chest"). The prose tells more than it shows, relying on adjective-heavy phrases like "daringly methodical, a paradoxical blend" that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by significant register clashes, specifically inserting technical jargon ("propagation delays," "cyclically reversed") into a fantasy context ("quill," "parchment"), which breaks the fictional dream. Several phrasings are clichés ("breath visible," "tang of electricity").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and forced insertion of required phrases, leading to clunky constructions like "propagate the truth." Repetitive phrasing ("mulberry ache" appears twice) and abstract metaphors ("mending perforations in the air") obscure the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("teetering on the edge of oblivion," "heart pounding," "eyes mirrored the aurora"). Information density is low, prioritizing abstract nouns and adjectives over concrete verbs and images.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is functional but cluttered with filter verbs (&quot;she felt,&quot; &quot;she saw&quot;) and awkward modifier stacks (&quot;kindly decisive hands&quot;). The writing relies on tired phrases (&quot;forgiving the unforgivable&quot;) and lacks the information density or propulsion needed to engage a demanding reader.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is marred by tautological artifacts ("As the chimes chimed") and stock phrasing ("promise of new beginnings," "simple yet profound"). The reliance on adjectives to convey meaning ("sincerely insincere") instead of action weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    Functional prose, but marred by stock phrasing ("movements deliberate," "deep breath," "shimmering faintly"). The density is low, with several sentences serving as stage directions rather than advancing the narrative or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and clichés ("bygone era," "time itself," "heart swelled"). Figurative language is often mixed or empty ("carved from... time itself"), and the heavy reliance on "telling" ("grace of one who had learned") obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("defied logic," "pierced the heavens," "shimmering chambers") and lacks fresh sensory imagery. The awkward insertion of the prompt phrase "brilliance dimness" creates a jarring linguistic artifact that breaks the line-level flow.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    The phrase "meteor hush" is repeated three times in a short text, becoming a distracting artifact. The prose relies heavily on weak modifiers ("soft," "faint," "ethereal") and clichés ("without thinking"), reducing impact and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("static bursts," "backwards prophecy," "ambered") and heavy use of adverbs ("quietly," "carefully," "instantly"). "Once-expanses universe" is a grammatical error. The writing relies on telling ("Her motivation was clear") over showing, resulting in low information density and inert momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by repetitive diction (e.g., "shards of light," "shards of night," multiple uses of "echo") and abstract nouns ("purpose," "meaning," "resonance"). The reliance on "telling" phrases ("motivation burned clear") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by cliché ("gleamed under the first light," "whisper of past storms") and abstract summary. The sequencing relies on "and then" transitions ("The first step was," "The sun climbed higher," "As he hung"), creating a plodding rhythm without density or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies on summary for the most critical moments ("conversations sparked," "laughter returned") instead of dramatizing the change. There are frequent cliché phrases ("heart full," "beacon of hope") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("symphony of light and shadow," "dew-kissed") and abstract phrasing ("touch of wonder," "ancient freshness"). The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on adjective-noun pairs weakens the immediacy of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by scaffolding constructions ("It was not just... but...") and redundancies like "remembering through muscle memory." Information density is low, with many sentences restating the protagonist's competence or the burden's weight without advancing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on abstract telling ("journey... of emotional rebirth") and cliché modifiers ("silent grace," "deepest fears") rather than concrete imagery. Adjective stacking dampens the impact of key descriptions, and the pacing is sluggish due to the abundance of internal explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from abstract overwriting and clunky insertion of required elements ("employing orthogonal approaches"). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew") distance the reader from the immediate experience, and the "summary" paragraph disrupts the rhythmic momentum of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by forced vocabulary (misuse of "macerate") and stock phrasing ("blurred into minutes," "broken and whole"). Sentence rhythm is often repetitive, lacking the variety or propulsion needed to sell the "symphony" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from telling over showing ("Her response was immediate," "Elara sensed its significance"). Several phrases appear to be inserted forcibly to meet prompt requirements ("foggy lucidity," "interiorizing exteriors"), resulting in clunky syntax and oxymorons that disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("forgotten dreams," "dying light," "world held its breath," "against all odds") that dull the imagery. Sentences often function as scaffold for abstract concepts rather than delivering concrete action ("attempting to vivify the lifeless"). The reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") and passive descriptions distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is technically functional but cluttered with clichés ("skeletal fingers," "holding its breath") and abstract nouns. The "serenely electric" prompt attribute is inserted awkwardly. The reliance on filter verbs and explanation ("She realized," "She understood") dilutes the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective stuffing ("resiliently positive," "inexplicable," "unconventional") and clichés ("shimmered with... glow," "without a trace"). The line-level execution fails to catch the major continuity breach regarding the hourglass.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by clunky prompt-phrase insertions ("realistically imaginary," "unsettling calm") that create oxymorons without poetic payoff. There is a high density of abstract nouns and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") that dull the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is mechanically competent but weighed down by summary transitions and awkward, prompt-forced phrasing like "balancedly curious" that disrupts the rhythm. The reliance on telling over showing in pivotal moments ("Slowly, a new geometry emerged") dilutes the scene's power.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("slipped through the cracks," "breadcrumbs," "chaos of life") and abstract, mixed metaphors ("clinging to her skin like a second layer of sorrow"). "Reeling hush" is an awkward phrase used repetitively without earning its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("shimmering haze," "breath ragged," "strange calm") and mixed metaphors ("silt and secrets"). The repeated phrase "crashing hush" feels forced and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "she [verb], [participial phrase]" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("dance like fireflies," "glistening like a thousand opals") and abstract comparisons that obscure clarity. The text relies on scaffold sentences to bridge gaps ("It was then she noticed," "The process was delicate"), reducing momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("jagged teeth," "faint of heart," "pulse with a life of their own," "blinding flash," "brink of extinction") that dull the imagery. "Suddenly" is used to bridge the central gap in logic, acting as a scaffold rather than a transition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.0)
    Line-level execution is marred by awkward prompt integration ("the missing return changed" reads as a garbled proper noun) and grammatical errors (using the verb "metamorphose" as a noun). Phrasing is often adjective-heavy and static.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but dense with adjectival padding ("resonantly soft," "fragile yet persistent," "rigid precision"). The rhythm is somewhat monotonous, and the reliance on abstract nouns to describe music and magic distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene. Line-level craft is functional but lacks freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is weighed down by excessive adjective-noun pairings ("brittle hush," "forgotten relic," "ghostly echo") and clichés ("pride and joy," "slipping through the cracks," "heart heavy with hope and sorrow"). The writing draws attention to itself with ornamental phrasing that slows momentum rather than sharpening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("spoke volumes," "heart of a forgotten valley") and weak passive constructions. Key moments are blunted by abstract summaries of action ("song reached its climax") rather than concrete details of the physical performance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("heart pounding," "kaleidoscope of words," "living, breathing entity"). The prompt phrase "sanely eccentric" is repeated verbatim as a telling label, signaling a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from density without propulsion, overloaded with modifiers and abstract noun phrases. Repeated use of prompt-specific terms like "vitalize" and "cipher" feels mechanical. The text lacks line-level energy, relying on scaffolded descriptions of feelings rather than active, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract phrasing ("folds of memory," "tone of her longing") and a reliance on filter verbs ("seemed to," "saw"). The writing lacks syntactic variety and propulsion, often stalling in static description rather than advancing through action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("silent sentinel," "skeletal remains," "shards of glass") that dull the imagery. The forced integration of prompt words leads to awkward phrasing ("task now was to detect"), and the repetitive sentence structures reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés and simile overload ("dust motes danced," "steam curling like whispers," "flowing like a river breaking through a dam"). "Combative tenderness" is repeated as a label but creates an oxymoron that confuses rather than clarifies the action. The writing suffers from "purple" tendencies, prioritizing decorative adjectives over strong verbs and concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with "purple" abstractions ("essence," "soul," "spirit," "wonder") and lacks concrete imagery. The phrase "radiant hush" is repeated to the point of becoming a distracting artifact, and the text relies on "tell" statements ("insatiably creative") instead of showing actions.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant repetitive phrasing diminishes impact; "accumulated silence" (and variations) appears four times, and "restless spirits" four times. The prose leans on heavy adjective-noun pairings ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that tell rather than show, creating a dense but static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from "purple" phrasing and pseudo-profound logic, such as "preserved by the very silence," which breaks suspension of disbelief. The use of summary for the primary action ("hours turned into days") indicates a lack of control over scene pacing and density.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is readable but marred by the logical contradictions of the imagery (e.g., "brittle" pages in water). Flowery phrasing ("labyrinth of unfinished narratives") occasionally obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose is weighed down by filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "knew") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The text suffers from repetitive sentence structures and "purple" descriptions that prioritize ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts dominate the text. The word "unfolded" appears seven times, often in awkward contexts ("unfolded a clock's face," "unfolded a small drawer"), creating a distraction that harms immersion. "Scattered light" and "warmly inquisitive" also repeat excessively within a short word count, indicating a lack of lexical control and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant cliché use ("silent testament," "patchwork of fields," "resolve unshakable") and repetitive phrasing ("dusty starlight" appears three times). The density is low, with many sentences restating the previous thought without advancing the narrative or image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "impending demise," "heart pounding") and repetitive phrasing (the prompt phrase "fractally precise" is used as a crutch). The climax is glossed over in summary ("Hours passed"), bypassing the opportunity for concrete line-level detailing of the work. The text relies on abstract intensifiers rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("trembling hands," "heart racing") and awkward phrasing ("sociable isolation" appears to be a malapropism for social isolation or solitary confinement). Dialogue tags rely on adverbs ("whispered," "muttered"), and the text tells rather than shows key traits.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.5)
    Line-level execution is weakened by a jarring subject-verb agreement error ("she uncap") and the forced insertion of prompt words ("driftwood nostalgia of the place") that create semantic confusion. Cliché density is high, with phrases like "older than the stars" and "broken only by the faint ticking."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is competent but marred by "purple" overwriting and specific artifact loops. The phrase "brambled hope" is repeated three times (intro, mid, outro) and "strangers become family" twice, feeling like forced prompt insertions rather than organic language. These loops drag down the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of prompt phrases ("hush" appears five times; "beautifully flawed" and "bruised awe" multiple times) creates a template-like cadence. The prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("pane of hush," "hush of time’s final ripple") that obscure clarity. High adjective density slows momentum without adding specific information.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the descriptive prose is solid, the decision to summarize the high-stakes rescue ("Using the map, she led them") deflates the narrative momentum. The climax occurs off-camera in a single sentence, robbing the scene of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("swirled and danced," "whisper from the universe," "fall into place," "anchor") and stock metaphors. Figurative language is decorative and reduces clarity ("symphonically attuned") rather than creating specific, tangible imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is often overwritten, relying on adjectival stacking ("fractured light," "pulsating with a rhythm") and clichés ("heart quickened," "swirling sea") that soften the imagery. Constraint integration is clumsy, resulting in awkward phrasing like "had gone mindfully scattered," and the repetition of "no accident" creates a scaffold artifact that weakens the causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose is weighed down by stock phrases ("air hung heavy," "hues of pink and gold," "wondrous and burdensome"). The insertion of the required phrase "sturdy brittle" results in a grammatical stumble ("Elara’s tone was sturdy brittle"), exposing the seam of the prompt rather than integrating it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is cluttered with modifiers and abstract nouns ("vigorous resolve," "metaphorical silo"). The phrase "empathetically decisive" is a significant tell-not-show artifact that flattens the moment it aims to describe.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("remnants of a bygone era," "silvery glow") and abstract filtering. The reliance on summary and adjective-heavy description prevents immediate, concrete visualization of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("heart pounding," "deep breath," "ancient secrets") and awkward scaffold phrases. The prompt phrases ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") are inserted forcefully, disrupting rhythm and sense.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("whispered secrets," "music... waiting to be set free") and abstract nouns ("resilience," "beauty") that obscure concrete imagery. Metaphors are often mixed or applied as literal mechanics ("reading [cracks] like sheet music") without grounding in the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose frequently explains its own metaphors ("symbolizing the end of one chapter"), which deflates literary tension. Clichés ("holding its breath") and a high density of filter verbs ("she recalled," "she understood") weaken the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose is dense with stock metaphors and clichés ("hold its breath" appears twice, "tapestry of unspoken stories," "symphony of sound," "like a hug"). These artifacts obscure the scene's reality and reduce the narrative to a collection of sentimental tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.6)
    Prose is heavy on "telling," with abstract nouns ("collective consciousness," "undercurrent of wisdom") replacing concrete imagery. Line-level craft is marred by awkward constructions ("olfactorily sensitive nose detected") and clichés ("tears welled," "veil between seen and unseen"). The rhythm is often monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is heavily modified with adjectives that tell rather than show ("intrepid," "chaotic," "deliberate"). The writing relies on cliché constructions ("whirling silence," "ancient power") and lacks the density or rhythmic variety required for higher bands. The climax is narrated through abstract energy pulses rather than concrete physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is marred by clichéd similes ("guts of a giant," "death trap") and repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("singular convergence," "rapidly adapting mind") which appear verbatim multiple times. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she saw") dilute the immediacy of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is polished but leans toward "purple" abstraction ("heavy with the promise of stillness," "liquid sunlight"). There is a reliance on telling ("The moment had come") and some awkward phrasing driven by prompt insertion ("certify," "oscillating repose").

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.6)
    A glaring grammatical error ("she uncase her satchel") undermines the prose quality. The text is heavily reliant on clichés ("haunted her dreams," "tapestry of colors") and weak verb-adverb combinations that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by stock imagery ("shimmering with an otherworldly glow," "vessel," "tapestry") and abstract nouns that dull immediacy. The phrase "lucid turbulence" reads as an oxymoronic insertion rather than a coherent description, and the reliance on clichés weakens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by a significant grammatical slip ("his teachings echoes in her mind") and some cliché phrasings ("shadows that danced like spirits"). The rhythm is often interrupted by explanatory clauses that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("captured stars," "whisper carried on the wind," "veil between the seen and unseen," "heart aching"). These artifacts dilute specific imagery and reduce the emotional impact to stock phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("liquid gold," "fabric of time") and repetitive phrasing ("raveling silence... unravel the very fabric"). "Stoically sparkling" is a jarring modifier mismatch that breaks the image, and abstract noun phrases like "latent sacrifice" clog the rhythm without conveying concrete meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy reliance on abstract nouns and stock imagery ("liquid light," "fragile hope"). The word "azure" is overused (appearing four times as sky, eyes, glow, and hues), creating a repetitive distraction. "Hours turned into days" is a scaffold sentence that saps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("stark contrast," "without warning," "pulsed with energy") and relies on telling over showing. Sentence structures are repetitive, and information density is diluted by abstract descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but marred by "fiction diction" and purple phrasing ("luminescent ache," "sentinel," "relentless sea"). Metaphors like "sinking into him like an anchor" are stock images that add little freshness or density.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is heavily laden with clichés ("slicing... like a sword," "panic flickered") and tautologies ("careful precision"). Abstract noun-adjective pairings ("shadowed elation," "unnatural rhythm") replace concrete imagery, and the register drifts inconsistently between mythic pretension and pseudo-science.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose suffers from "adjective stuffing" and abstract modifiers ("iridescent caution") that blur clarity. Repetitive sentence structures ("As the sun dipped lower... As the sun dipped below") create a scaffold effect. The writing tells the reader how to feel ("quietly explosive") rather than evoking the sensation through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from abstraction ("mundane miracles," "sorrow quantified") and lacks concrete, active imagery. The phrase "At the moment a pin dropped" is repeated as a clumsy framing device rather than an organic observation, and the text relies on passive constructions. The "purple" descriptions obscure the action rather than clarifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is overburdened with abstract modifiers and mixed metaphors ("polished to a sheen that mirrored the stars") that slow narrative momentum. Repetitive use of prompt-derived terms ("swaddle," "knit," "woven") creates a checklist effect, and the "bound release" phrasing appears awkward and forced.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("heart full of resolve," "hidden in plain sight") and abstract phrasing that obscures specific imagery. The reliance on adjective-heavy description halts momentum and prevents sharp, sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "golden glow," "deep sense of peace") and abstract telling. The integration of required phrases is mechanical, creating noticeable artifacts that break the rhythm and believability of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from "telling" over "showing" and repetitious phrasing (the specific prompt phrase "gently meticulous" is repeated as a fixed epithet in the first and last paragraphs). Adjective-heavy descriptions clutter the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("cat and mouse," "hides in plain sight," "more questions than answers," "tension palpable," "playing a dangerous game"). These stock phrases replace specific observation and dull the story's impact. The density of "text artifacts" (template metaphors) severely hampers literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract descriptors ("quiet expanse," "blooming flora," "ethereal light"), slowing momentum. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated (once in narration, once in dialogue), creating an awkward echo. There is a tendency toward "label-speak" ("luminous skeptic," "paradox that defined her") that replaces genuine characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("breath catching in her throat," "time stood still" equivalent) and adjective-heavy modification ("charcoal-fingered," "jagged edges"). The repeated phrase regarding the "echo of laughter" feels pasted in rather than woven into the rhythm of the scene. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Subject verb, modifier" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentence structure is competent but frequently relies on "telling" blocks to convey information ("Elara’s gift was unique..."). The prose suffers from modifier clusters ("gilded-leaf calligrapher," "zinc-etched postal plate fragment") that weigh down the rhythm without adding density. There are few active verbs driving the scene, resulting in a passive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("kissed the ground," "golden light," "draped like a blanket") and abstract nouns that obscure imagery. Phrases like "seasonally mute lips" are anatomically awkward, and the "muted vigor" descriptor feels forced to fit the prompt. The writing tells emotions ("heart full of hope") rather than evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.9)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" each appear three times) creates a scaffolded, loop-like quality. The prose relies on weak abstraction ("relentless," "chaos," "harmony") rather than concrete verbs and nouns, dulling the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies on a high density of clichés ("first light of dawn," "long shadows," "heart quickened," "mind raced"), which flattens the imagery. Sentence structures are functional but repetitive, often following a "Description, acting as explanation" cadence. The specific phrase "sandstorm calm" appears as a forced artifact that disrupts the semantic logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("silent as the ocean," "clutched in her hand," "tomb of silence," "beacon in the darkness") that dull the imagery. Sentence structure is repetitive and lacks propulsion, often defaulting to a "Subject + Verb + Abstract Modifier" cadence that creates a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("slipped through his mind like sand through his fingers") and adjectival stacking ("gleaming silence," "delicate petals"). The pivotal moment of the story is evaded with the phrase "What happened next was beyond description," which abdicates the writer's responsibility to visualize the strange. Line-level momentum is stalled by expository scaffolding that summarizes backstory instead of showing active thought.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("everywhere and nowhere," "threads of moonlight," "beacon in the darkness") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader from the action. The reliance on "purple" descriptors obscures the mechanics of the scene and dulls the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is laden with purple clichés ("whispered secrets to the stars," "continuing a conversation that had been paused for years"). Scaffolding sentences ("There was something about his manner," "She hesitated") slow the momentum. "Patiently nimble" reads as a forced prompt insertion that clashes with the surrounding diction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is weighed down by clichéd modifier-noun pairings ("tragically radiant," "velvet garden") and purple abstractions. The text relies heavily on scaffolding sentences ("She understood now," "Elara hesitated") that stall momentum. Figurative language is imprecise, and the "resonance structures" phrasing introduces a jarring register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from mixed metaphors ("unlink the threads") and reliance on cliché similes ("dissolving like mist," "hung like crystalline teeth"). The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding necessary precision to the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose suffers from clunky insertion of prompt phrases ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue") that clash with the mythic tone. Repetitive phrasing and reliance on abstract nouns ("secrets," "truth," "intrigue") dilute density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés and redundancies: "hushed stillness," "hold its breath," "heavy... with secrets," "eyes wide with wonder." These artifacts prevent the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is weighed down by "purple" descriptors and forced phrasing ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") that clashes with clarity. The text relies on telling over showing, with frequent abstract metaphors that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter ("cataclysmic event," "eerie glow," "formless mass") and relies on label-as-description artifacts (repeating "sharply observant" three times). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variance and syntactic control needed to heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.4)
    Line-level craft is dominated by clichés ("heart pounding," "trembling hands," "endless expanse") and telling instead of showing. The literal insertion of the prompt's tonal instruction ("a sense of both danger and possibility... a gritty whimsy") as a descriptive noun phrase is a significant artifact failure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose relies heavily on "purple" descriptors ("lonesome splendor," "symphony of time") and clichéd similes ("like a bird testing its wings"). Information density is low, with several sentences devoted to abstract explanations of the magic system rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("heart pounded with urgency," "deafening roar") and adjective stuffing ("fleeting golden sunset"). Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as labels ("logically emotional devotion") rather than woven into the fabric of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is laden with adverbs ("softly purposeful") and purple abstractions ("air crackled with restrained wildness"). The integration of required phrases results in awkward syntax ("magnetic viaduct after rain" used as a rigid proper noun). Repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]... Her [noun]...") create a monotonous rhythm that drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("storm of thoughts," "web of corruption," "heart quickened") and abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability"). The use of "empirical observation" as a lead-in for a list of visual details is clunky. The writing prioritizes purple description over clear, active causality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by tautologies ("weighing the weight") and cliché constructions ("calm before the storm"). Adverb-heavy descriptions and slightly purple dialogue reduce clarity and momentum, keeping the score in the functional range.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is competent but cluttered with clichés ("heart raced," "vibrate through her very soul") and modifying adverbs that weaken the verbs ("steadily curious," "bobbed gently"). The description of the "holographic bell" making a sound strains credibility within the established gear-punk aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("heart raced," "kicked into overdrive") and adjective stacking ("haunting and melancholic"). Action is often summarized rather than shown, and the text relies on "telling" regarding the character's attributes and feelings.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("crisp scent," "pulsed faintly," "ancient eyes") and abstract nouns. High density of filter verbs and purple descriptions ("shadow-laced," "otherworldly energy") obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies on clichés ("heart skipped a beat," "broken teeth") and forced integration of prompt phrases ("fold in patience"). Rhythmic variation is limited, and the text suffers from abstract "filtering" (she felt, she thought).

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she realized," "she felt") and abstract telling ("complexities of human relationships," "stark reminder"). Scaffolding sentences ("Her task was to ensure...") slow the momentum. The writing lacks density, using clichés to describe emotional states rather than concrete, sensory-grounded details.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetition artifacts mar the prose; the prompt phrases "strangely honest" and "whisperfield calm" are repeated verbatim three times each, including at the closure. Adverb-heavy descriptions ("faintly," "instinctively") weaken the line-level density.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant reliance on clichés ("testament to time’s relentless march," "balm to the wounds," "heart lighter than it had been") and abstract "purple" phrasing. Density is low due to the abundance of filler phrases and lack of concrete, specific imagery. The writing tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the feeling through fresh language.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is weighed down by adjective-noun pairings and clichés like "mausoleum of forgotten texts" and "time itself had paused." Synonym churn ("fractured sequences," "disjointed fragments") stalls momentum, and the rhythm creates a lulling effect devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is mechanically sound and has a deliberate rhythm, but it suffers from "purple" descriptors ("damp veil," "prism for the future") that distance the reader. There is some synonym churn regarding memory and time that reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("slipped through fingers like grains of sand") and heavy-handed telling ("Driven by a motivation to harness the ephemeral"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "She [verb]..." pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from purple abstractions ("pulsing stillness") and awkward register clashes ("execute a flawless goodbye" vs. "hymning the mundane"). Clichéd phrasing ("unspoken plea," "weight of goodbye") replaces fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is serviceable but marred by stock phrasing ("pulsed faintly," "unseen force," "fingers traced") and a lack of rhythmic variety. The "loop" of returning to the workshop is narrated with low information density, offering generalized actions (etching symbols) instead of sharp, concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by "telling" and the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("nostalgic innovation") that break semantic logic. Abstract descriptors crowd out concrete action, and the reliance on "as if" constructions ("as if guiding her," "as if her very bones") dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("clung... like a whisper," "shimmering like a thousand eyes") and purple phrasing ("zephyr bloom of her spirit"). "Reflectively vibrant" is a clumsy modifier combination that obscures rather than clarifies the image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically sound but overwritten, relying on adjectival stacking ("soft and emerald," "delicate latticework"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "honeyed hush" feels forced, and the metaphor "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is repeated in variation, creating a slight redundancy loop. The polish effectively conveys atmosphere but lacks muscularity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elara felt," "realized," "knew") which distance the reader from the action. Abstract nouns ("despair," "triumph," "resignation") replace concrete imagery. The text is functional but lacks the density and propulsion required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten with clichés ("sparkled like stars," "liquid gold") and abstract descriptors that lower information density. Significant use of filter verbs and reliance on "suddenly" to drive action weaken line-level momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose relies on clichés ("wept its brilliance," "held its breath") and abstract metaphors that distance the reader; "moving stillness" is an oxymoron that feels forced; repetitive sentence structures limit rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "silent witness," "days turned into nights," "twilight seeped") that deaden the imagery. Frequent use of filter verbs ("He noticed," "he felt") creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the action. The writing relies on "purple" descriptors ("shimmered," "golden," "miracle") instead of specific, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from metaphor density and awkward phrasing ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie" used twice in close proximity). The reliance on adjective-heavy description slows momentum and distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant prose artifacts lower the quality, including the identical repetition of the phrase "hauntingly practical" (paragraphs 1 and 8) and the reuse of "crystallized time." Abstract metaphors often obscure rather than clarify the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is grammatically functional but suffers from abstract phrasing ("negotiate with her own ghost") and repetitive descriptors ("fractured stillness" appears three times). The confusion regarding whether she found the wheel weeks ago or now creates a stumble in clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and clichés ("ghosts of travelers past," "remnants of old dreams"). There is a high frequency of "filter" phrases ("Eli’s gaze fell," "imagining how," "realized the terminal") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant loop artifacts appear: the phrases "excruciatingly gentle" and "glacial hush" are repeated almost verbatim in different sections, creating a stagnant lexical loop. The prose relies on clichés ("tugged at her chest like an old wound") and abstract similes that dilute the imagery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with stock phrases and clichés ("held its breath," "echoed softly," "heart ached," "time long past"). The prompt phrase "thoughtfully clear" is inserted awkwardly as an adverbial modifier ("movements thoughtfully clear"), disrupting the flow and highlighting the mechanical nature of the writing. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, preventing the reader from visualizing the scene with any precision.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("world holding its breath," "logic in chaos," "crystalline blanket") and purple phrasing that obscures rather than reveals. There is significant telling over showing ("movements deliberate," "mind alight with understanding"), and the reliance on abstract nouns saps the scene of immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose leans heavily into "purple" description and clichés ("dissolving... like a memory," "quiet intrusion," "quiet hymn"). Adjective density slows the rhythm without adding information ("vivid reminder," "lonesome splendor"), and the reliance on abstract nouns ("geography of healing") weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with adjectives ("crystalline spires," "dim glow") and relies on stock phrases ("heart sank," "spark of determination"). Several prompt phrases ("hypothesizing about everything," "quaking reverie") are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose is weighed down by stock phrasing ("hummed with anticipation," "grace that belied," "snuffed out") and unnecessary adjectives. Sentence structures are repetitive, and the density of abstract metaphors obscures the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" tendencies, relying on cliché metaphors ("sharpening like a blade") and heavy personification ("stone lips," "air was thick"). Sentences are functional but often decorative, prioritizing sound over clarity or density. The reliance on "as if" constructions ("as if waiting for a sign," "as if alive") dilutes imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("grand tapestry of existence," "whispers of forgotten dreams") and abstract nouns that obscure meaning. The density of "purple" descriptors and lack of concrete verbs stalls momentum and creates a barrier to visualization.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with abstractions (essence, contours, presence, silence) and standard literary clichés ("symphony of color," "weight of centuries"). "Thundering calm" is an oxymoron that reads as overwriting. The reliance on abstract nouns dulls the impact of the physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract noun-adjective pairings ("searing reverie," "hypnotic grace") and "telling" artifacts that explain significance instead of showing it. There is a lack of concrete verbs and specific nouns, resulting in low information density.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.5)
    Semantic precision is poor, notably the misuse of "organized" ("fingers tenderly organized around a trowel"), likely a thesaurus artifact. The prose is laden with clichés ("whisper secrets," "time long gone") and mixed metaphors ("lines uncharted echoes") that obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is grammatically competent but heavily reliant on stock phrasing ("weight of possibility," "broke through the clouds"). The phrase "groundedly imaginative" is an awkward, label-heavy construction that disrupts flow. The writing tells rather than shows, especially in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from cliché ("world... hold its breath," "heart quickening," "mind racing") and logical contradiction regarding the "unknown language" she successfully translates. The rhythm is smooth but relies on standard sentence structures that do not heighten the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("fragility," "resilience") and stock phrases ("holding its breath," "bridged the gap") that dull the imagery. While the rhythm is controlled, the reliance on adjectives to carry emotional weight ("deliberate grace," "silent benediction") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of specific phrases ("rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm," "competing narratives") which appear in identical or near-identical forms, creating a robotic, templated rhythm. This reliance on fixed labels over descriptive variety flattens the texture and draws attention to the writing's scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from "purple" descriptors ("velvet library," "trapped melody") and clichés ("beacon of hope," "bygone era"). Several phrases appear to be forced prompt insertions that create logical friction (e.g., "denote the importance... by subtracting noise"). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation or density required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    Competent grammar, but the prose is weighed down by clichés ("whisper in the wind," "beyond measure"). Abstract filtering ("She knew," "She felt") distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("trembling hands," "spiraling into darkness") and repetitive sentence structures that sap momentum. Adjectival bloating ("nectar dusk," "faint hum," "strange pull") replaces strong verbs and specific nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by abstract metaphors ("shard of hush") and scaffold sentences that summarize internal states ("Elias was inadvertently profound"). The rhythm is static, and several prompt phrases are inserted as clunky descriptors rather than integrated syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is grammatically functional but cluttered with abstract noun-adjective piles ("incisively kind understanding," "cascading revelations") that obscure imagery. The reliance on passive construction and summary dulls the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.6)
    Phrases like "balancedly daring" are clumsy, unidiomatic artifacts that disrupt the reading flow. The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and clichés ("distant thunder," "ruptured the boundaries of logic") rather than concrete, sensory specificity. The density of exposition slows the momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean but saturated with clichés ("danced across," "unseen hand," "crept over the horizon," "breath catching") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are functional but repetitive, lacking the rhythmic variety or textural specificity required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("spread like wildfire," "danced with life") and abstract phrasing ("testament to the displaced peoples") that distances the reader. "Seemed to" constructions weaken the imagery, and the sentence rhythm is repetitive. The final paragraph creates a rapid-summary effect that flattens the narrative moment into a synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose relies on "telling" for key emotional beats ("bleak exhilaration," "unease") and uses repetitive somatic anchoring (four mentions of "hands" in a short space). Similes are frequent and somewhat heavy-handed ("ribs of some ancient beast"), creating a dense but occasionally purple texture.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and stock phrasing ("dying star," "weight of fear lifted"), creating a melodramatic tone that distances the reader. Prompt words like "unbosom" are forced into the syntax ("unbosom your heart"), disrupting rhythm and natural usage.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is grammatically functional but laden with clichés ("testament to nature’s resilience," "hues of indigo and silver") and abstract summaries. Figurative language is often ornamental rather than structural, slowing momentum without adding density or sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is serviceable but marred by pervasive clichés ("tangible dread," "unshaken resolve," "air thickened") and mechanical repetition of prompt phrases. The reliance on abstract labels ("quietly driven") instead of concrete action weakens the line-level impact and transparency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by "telling" constructions and abstract metaphors ("mind worked like a loom"). Several scaffold sentences ("It was here that...", "It was a reminder that...") dilute the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract noun phrases ("interlaced absence") and clashing modifiers ("stoically sensitive"). The repeated use of the phrase "hushed blaze" feels forced, and the reliance on "as if" constructions weakens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on "scaffold" structures ("As she...", "In the...") and template cadence that creates a monotonous rhythm. The insertion of required phrases is clunky, disrupting the flow (e.g., "tranquilly perceptive mind"). There is little sentence-level propulsion or textural density.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is marred by a significant typo in the climax ("like a embrace") and relies heavily on clichés ("struck him like a wave," "lover's whisper"). These artifacts break immersion and signal a lack of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("clung like a second skin," "shattered world," "leap into the unknown") and abstract phrasing. The phrase "intangibly tangible" is a jarring oxymoron that disrupts the reading flow. The writing relies on summary and adjectives rather than concrete verbs and nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose relies on clichés ("passage of centuries," "heart raced," "weight of history") and lacks density. The phrase "brilliant dimness" reads as an awkward oxymoron, and the "surprised expression" descriptor loops repetitively without adding depth.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("physical force," "relentless tide," "fractured pieces of his soul"). Prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as descriptors ("a sieved hush," "bathed in a tempered regret"), disrupting the natural flow of the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.4)
    Line-level craft is marred by mixed metaphors ("furrowed hush" is a category error) and clunky rhythm. The prose relies on abstract nouns and cliché simile structures that distance the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with clichés and purple phrasing ("sentinels against the horizon," "wash over her," "golden light"). Text artifacts include metaphor mixing (compass spinning "aimlessly" vs "mocking") and standard "workshop" polish that lacks freshness. The line-level craft prioritizes flowery description over specific, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("clung like a shadow," "clean slate") and filter verbs. The writing relies on summary and telling, with the "soft plop" of the ball failing to carry the necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("siren's song," "heart ached," "shiver through her"). Adjective-heavy phrasing ("paradoxically steady," "unearthly glow") reduces immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with stock clichés ("sand through clenched fists," "ghosts in the night," "tightening like a noose," "stone in her chest"). This high density of borrowed language obscures any unique voice or fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("teetered on the edge," "symphony of existence") and suffers from a distinct text loop: the phrase "shimmer of tears on [faded] photographs" is repeated almost verbatim in paragraphs 2 and 6, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("timeless dance," "shrouded in a veil," "tantalizing mystery") that reduce information density and impact. Phrases like "whispering hush" (redundant) and abstract constructions ("texture of transformation") weaken line-level clarity and momentum. The writing tells the reader how to feel ("profound sense of connection") instead of evoking the feeling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "telling" over "showing" and awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("expression a winking hush"). Adjective-noun pairings often feel padded ("vigilant lock sentinel," "dying torches"), creating a rhythm that lacks propulsion and density.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose leans into abstraction and purple description ("danced like a borrowed dawn," "kaleidoscope of light") rather than concrete grounding. The reliance on adjective-heavy telling slows momentum and distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché, including "lightning cracking like a whip" and the forced "furiously tranquil" phrasing. Line-level artifacts like "storm-kissed wonder" disrupt clarity and credibility in an attempt to force resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is mechanically competent but leans toward "purple" abstraction ("dignified chaos," "carve certainty from the labyrinth"). The heavy use of metaphorical noun phrases obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("shedding... like a snake," "quiet strength," "flowing like a river breaking through a dam"). These artifacts flatten the imagery, while the high density of stock metaphors and similes obscures any distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose relies on clichés ("stir the soul," "heart pounding," "kaleidoscope of colors") and telling modifiers ("strategically creative mind"). These artifacts dull the imagery and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is functional but laden with clichés ("dissolve like ink in water," "intertwined like vines") and abstract phrasing. The reliance on explanation ("a symbol of resilience") undermines the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés and overwriting ("weary soul," "otherworldly light"). The phrase "rhythmically placid melody" creates a confused image (mixed metaphor of sound/scent and motion/stillness) that weakens the line-level clarity.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean, each advancing image or pattern. Occasional stacked modifiers (“once-lush sanctuary for exotic plants”) flirt with purple but stay legible. No paraphrase loops; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“dust…a quiet architect”—is forgivable and image-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet limpid: single sentences fuse action, sensory detail, and emotional charge (“her fingers tracing the icy designs, her mind piecing together…”). No scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (frost = ledger ink, canyon = silence that hums). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. One tiny register lift—“discover purpose in the pauses”—but rescued by immediate sensory follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “frosted ferns,” “veins visible through winterglass” do two jobs—sense data + metaphor. Rhythm varies; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent (glass→waterfall→canvas) and paid off at closure. Minor scaffold: “world had capsized” appears twice—once could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, with vivid nouns (“seaweed-green leather,” “fractured prisms”). One metaphor string in climax (“rest a permanent address,” “tide receding”) is decorative but not muddled. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; sentences vary in length and opening. Occasional elevated phrase (“metaphorical darkness”) nudges register slight-above POV, keeping it short of 8+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are lean, mostly varied openings; no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystallized final moment”) verge on workshop diction but stay within voice. Information density is solid; each paragraph advances situation or image. No metaphor clashes or scaffold sentences; closing line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Density is high: a single sentence often layers scent, memory, and motion. No filter-verb stacks, no scaffold loops. One mixed-metor risk—“skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria”—reads as intentional body/flower fusion, not slippage. Closing line is crisp and propels: “her steps lighter, her heart fuller,” avoiding explanatory tag.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The chains rattled softly, a reminder of the burden they carried, but also of the strength it had forged” delivers texture and backstory in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; “rusted Ferris wheel creaked like an old man’s bones” is the single allowed metaphor and it is apt. Opening line anchors stakes and atmosphere simultaneously. Final line—“their grace staggering in its quiet triumph”—earns its adjective by inheriting the entire kinetic release that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: “She collected it, carefully, as one might gather fragile glass” advances action, embodies stakes, and foreshadows forge delicacy. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor (aurora as forge-light, absence as glass) is used once and paid. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets—damp earth vs. quiet strength—creating echoic cadence. Minor elevated diction (“ethereal,” “surrendered”) is POV-justified by her designer intellect.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—action, atmosphere, motive cue: “She stepped back, her hand hovering… challenge to whoever had left the trap.” No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Metaphors stay coherent (moonbeams = captured memory) and physically stable. Final line propels without scaffold: “a thief no longer, but a seeker…” cleanly resolves arc.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clean, high density: “molten glass into delicate, translucent spheres” twins action and metaphor in one stroke. Filter-verb clusters absent; metaphors stay coherent (glass heart). Minor scaffold: “the room...the room...” opener repetition; “cracks...cracks...” echo inside one beat. These loops do not touch closure but prevent 8.2+ clearance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance either decoding progress or sensory mood. Rhythmic variety alternates between long atmospheric fragments and sharp action beats. No scaffold loops; metaphor count stays low, avoiding purple fog. A single mixed image—“mirrors began to crack… into light”—is momentarily physical-impossible but reads as surreal culmination, not clarity break, so penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; figurative language (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) repeats twice but reads as deliberate motif rather than synonym churn. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy is preserved. Occasional abstraction (“weight of centuries”) flirts with generality yet stays within voice. No artifacts touch the closing beat, sustaining momentum to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, clean, high-density: “air thick with the kind of silence that seemed to hold its breath” does three jobs in eleven words. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each advances image or knowledge. Minor cadence repetition of “its”-headed sentences in paragraph 3 keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose breathes with sentence variety; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“ambiguously clear” recurs but is motif, not artifact. Metaphors (crystals whisper) stay coherent. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor filter verbs (“she noticed”) are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with deliberate paragraph breaths; sentences vary length to mimic pruning pauses. Figurative control disciplined—only two sustained metaphors, both taught early and paid off. Zero filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Information dense: one sentence often sets scene + emotional tilt. Minor nominalization “collection” repeats; not severe enough to dull closure image. Final line (“garden…gratitude”) lands clean and concise.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse tool-action with emotional valence (“tightened a bolt…purpose tied to her deepest motivation”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors disciplined. Occasional modifier repetition (“glow, glowing, luminescence”) but spaced enough to avoid drumbeat. Read-aloud rhythm varied; paragraphs cut cleanly. Closure sentence free of prose clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is selective—water as ink, silence as trapped music—each image returns with reweighted meaning at closure, avoiding purple overload. One paraphrase loop occurs: “in between spaces” appears three times in four sentences; the repetition is purposeful, pattern-taught, but still draws a −0.2 artifact penalty. Information density is high: a single sentence often layers sensory cue, emotional tilt, and plot clue; no scaffolding bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, information-dense; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (flower breathing, truth as root) stay consistent and physically coherent. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“jagged shard” swallowed—minor, does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with charged image. No artifacts in final third; high-band safe.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; few filters or scaffold loops. Metaphors are familiar (“danced like spectral figures”) but not muddled. High info density early; some filler creeps in later (“the machine groaned to life, gears grinding as if awakening from a long slumber”). No artifact touches closure; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Sentences carry double duty: “Its folds shifted, revealing a hidden compartment…” advances plot and deepens mythic texture. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. One paraphrase loop—“the library felt heavier… the library no longer felt like a burden”—is forgivable because it marks the thematic pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths modulate with eclipse dim/bright arc. No loops or scaffold; redundant phrasing is minor (“quiet expanse…hush of dreaming roots”). Metaphors are conventional but coherent. Information density dips only in the thematic tag lines; elsewhere each sentence advances image or beat. Closure line is crisp, avoiding exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“bronze quiet,” “dragons breathed life”—and does not clog the climax. High information density: each sentence advances artifact, motive, or world-rule. No paraphrase loops; “displaced axis” recurs but gains new causal weight each time. Copy is clean; only minor hedge—“seemed to deepen”—could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line craft is clean: no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Density is moderate; some sentences iterate mood synonymously (“enigmatic fortunes,” “familiar enigma”) without new pressure. Final third stays legible, but figurative language never sharpens—keeps same dusk-soft lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong auditory and void imagery, but recurrent abstract nouns (“assumptions,” “existence,” “truth”) create template cadence that dulls immediacy. Metaphors stay coherent yet stacked in places (“void given form,” “canvas waiting”). No paraphrase loops, but filter-verb clusters (“he began to,” “he continued to”) soften propulsion. Closure line is clean; earlier scaffolding keeps it from 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with sentence openings varied and no template cadence. Figurative language is dense—mirrored horizon, threads of light—but the pattern is taught early and never muddles causality at the climax. One minor paraphrase loop (“the writer… began to map… as they began to map”) is a 0.2 nick; otherwise high information density without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns (“urgency,” “resolve,” “truth”) where concrete image would sharpen. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor chain is coherent. One mixed vehicle: “ribbon of light” then “fractals” shifts physical logic without cue. Line-level propulsion remains steady; final paragraph lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with sentence variation that echoes drum cadence. No template-cadence runs; occasional adjective pairs (“smooth yet silent”) are purposeful, not churn. One paraphrase loop: “emotional numbness had become her constant companion” + “trapped in a silence… of her own making” restate the same stasis. Otherwise high density: each sentence layers craft, stakes, or image. Closure sentence is clean, no artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information density high: single sentences deliver tool, motion, and emotional tilt (“He turned it over, his credibly curious nature sparking…”). No mixed metaphors; “symphony he knew all too well” is familiar but brief. Minor template cadence in triple “his” opens (“His fingers… His brow… His mind…”) yet pressure sustains. Closure image is uncluttered, strong verb choice (“charged with an unfamiliar tension”) re-energizes earlier motif.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, and largely loop-free; metaphor count is high but pattern-taught early (ultraviolet = revelation). One paraphrase loop: “the vial’s glow intensified” appears twice within five lines. No mixed metaphors or strained physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line softly resolves via image. Minor scaffold: “its surface shimmered with a faint ultraviolet glow, as though it held a secret” could compress to “its ultraviolet shimmer hinted at a secret,” but the slack is marginal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: long lyrical clauses for contemplation, staccato prepositional clusters (“inside the alcove was a mirror”) at reveal. Metaphors stay physically coherent—rope as serpent, patterns as grooves—no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances image or choice. Information density high: “frayed coil...forgotten promise” does double exposition work. Closing line’s chiasmus (“write—and rewrite, endlessly”) earns cadence shift without algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; sporadic template cadence (“She thought of… of the… of the…”) and an occasional stacked adjective (“haunting and beautiful”) dull momentum but do not touch the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information-dense lines: “fragile contents remained undisturbed” does double duty (care + peril). Rhythm varies; only minor scaffold (“as she…”) twice. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicle in peak beat. Final line earns cadence echo.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are clear, concise, and free of loops or scaffold. Occasional soft filler (“mind racing,” “cool night”) but nothing that stalls momentum. Metaphors are restrained and coherent; no artifact touches the closure beat. Efficient, serviceable line work.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, vivid, largely loop-free; occasional soft fillers (“as if it were urging her forward”) slightly dilute causality. Metaphors stay coherent: canal serpent, tapestry thread. No scaffold clusters or mixed vehicles in the closure beat; momentum breathes with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lucid, mostly scaffold-free; sentences pull double duty describing setting and forwarding plot. Occasional filler slips—“she felt a strange connection,” “her mind racing with possibilities”—dull immediacy. Mixed-metaphor danger is avoided; metaphors are spare and coherent. No artifacts intrude on the closing beat, keeping clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with storm: long damp sentences early, staccato rearranging beats late. No loops or scaffold; “rainwater” / “storm” repetitions are purposeful motif reinforcement. Metaphors (leaf as messenger) stay consistent and physically coherent. High information density: one sentence often does scent + action + interior tilt. Minor purple tinge in “kissed by the rain” but forgiven as it pays off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, vivid, mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold (“her mind buzzing with questions”) and a single mixed metaphor (“tapestry of parched lands and reclaimed seas”) slightly dull the opening. Information density is high; each paragraph advances discovery. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is restrained—one mixed metaphor (“harmonies weaving a symphony of secrets”) but it precedes the high-pressure beat and does not obscure causality. Information density is high: each sentence advances perception or mythic logic. Final line is crisp and image-driven, recharging “bright darkness.” Minor scaffolding: two adjacent “she understood / she saw” lines could compress, but they fall outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene beats—long inhale of description, staccato finds, sustained final note. Metaphors stay physical (“harbor itself was responding”) and consistent; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence often layers action, setting cue, and interior tilt. One soft loop: “weight a familiar comfort” ≈ “weight in her satchel” could compress, but does not blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences switch length to mirror breathless walk versus crystalline pedestal moment; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Only micro-slip: “as though it had been waiting for her all along” appears twice—once for punch, once for gates—an echo not quite justified by motif necessity. Otherwise density is high and metaphors stay physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, scaffold-free; no loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is good—single sentences layer sensory cue and emotional import. Line-level control supports the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: strong verbs (“shudder,” “fractured,” “reeled”) and selective adjectives. One paraphrase loop (“colors around him flickering like a dying flame… prismatic colors twisted into chaotic patterns”) costs −0.2. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or beat. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphor. “Ink liquefying rigid thinking” is the single lyrical reach, but it is pattern-taught by the ripple and paid off at climax, so allowed. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Minor tic: two “seemed to” filters could be cut, but they do not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is selective and rarely stacked. Occasional filter phrases (“seemed to amplify,” “felt different”) slightly dull immediacy, but no loops or mixed metaphors obscure the closing image. Clean copy; one paraphrase loop (“histories that only she could decipher… histories that lingered”) earns a −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or mixed metaphors; sentence rhythm modulates with tidal cadence. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only atmospheric work. No scaffolding, but occasional abstract nouns (“existence a glitch,” “texture of memories”) substitute for concrete image. Closure line is crisp, earning its lift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, concise, and mostly propulsive; sensory detail woven through action. Occasional soft fillers (“strange warmth spread,” “hues of amber and gold”) and one scaffold pair (“whispered… promises… profit opportunity”) slightly dilute density. No mixed metaphors, loops, or tense slips; opening and closing images land crisply. Artifact level stays below closure-interference threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary openings and length. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative layer (“shadows danced,” “universe whispered”) is restrained and patterned early, so it reads as voice rather than decoration. One mixed vehicle—“dawning hush” literalized as both time and emotional mood—barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled: longer sentences breathe during repair, then shorten at the hum’s return. Figurative language is sparse and integrated—“anchor of destiny,” “soul within the machine”—no mixed metaphors. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; “drone,” “hummingbird,” and “machine” are precisely alternated. Final line avoids cadence cliché by ending on the ambiguous promise of “begin again.”

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—longer clauses in contemplative beats, shorter pulses at the ice edge. Figurative language is selective, never clustering in high-pressure beats; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops detected. Minor paraphrase echo (“the pattern again” repeated within four lines) nicks perfection but does not cloud causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free, but overwrought clusters (“wild hush that had enveloped…began to give way to a subtle vibrancy”) slow the final beat. Occasional adverbial padding (“infinitely patient,” “seemed to”) dilutes density; still, no artifact obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, with vivid image density; no scaffold loops or template cadence. Metaphors (“temple holding its breath”) are apt but slightly plentiful in crisis beats, nudging overwriting. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored. Occasional elevated register (“unsnarl,” “conceptual repricing” cognates) feels slightly above Maya’s likely idiom, but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent arc; sentences vary and cut cleanly. One paraphrase loop (“he wanted… he wanted”) and a filter stack (“he thought of… he realized…”) slightly dull the climax; metaphors stay coherent. No artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor is sustained (“branches twisted like the arms of a mourner”) rather than stacked, avoiding purple overload. Occasional abstraction (“resonant awakenings”) slightly dilutes density, but most sentences carry double duty—atmosphere plus interiority. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the final third stays clean, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high information density (“each pass, the illustrations…seemed to come alive”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors are avoided. One strained phrase (“gallery of orchid solace”) lightly bruises clarity, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense: each sentence advances image or emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored. Minor over-modification (“warmly curious,” “soft earth”) is tolerable at this length. Final third is free of artifacts; clarity at closure is intact. Strong verb choices (“snaked,” “sank,” “slid”) keep momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variety and propulsion strong; information dual-loaded (“golden arcade shimmered with soft, ethereal glow” sets scene + stakes). One paraphrase loop: “echoes of the past remained” restates prior nostalgia; −0.2. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear passes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, high-density; sentences carry dual duty (description + pressure). No paraphrase loops; “echoed silence” recurs with purpose. Metaphors stay coherent: flame as anchor, threads as star-paths. One mixed metaphor—“conspiracies were like knots in the cosmic thread”—reads slightly pat but does not tangle closure. Opening and final lines anchor and re-anchor voice effectively. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she wondered”) they reflect genuine uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically varied; sentence lengths contract slightly at revelations to cue breath. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“roots twisted like ancient fingers” is the single explicit simile and it holds. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. One minor template cadence: three successive sentences beginning “The…” in the climactic grove paragraph, but it echoes ritual liturgy and reads intentional. Overall clarity is high; no scaffolding or synonym churn is present to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, varied, and propulsive. No scaffold loops; sentences open differently, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is selective—“fog-drenched ruins,” “luminous vials”—and never clusters into purple. Final line snaps shut with cadence echo of opening fog. Minor opportunity: one “seemed to shift” hedge could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense; metaphor strings serve the garden’s synesthesia without overcrowding. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated cadence (“nested awakenings,” “bewitch the soul”) edges toward thesaurus-lite but stays motivated by the lyric concept. Closing image earns its flourish; no artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful paragraph lengths; sentences layer image and motion efficiently. Occasional filler scaffolding—“seemed to cradle,” “seemed to conspire”—dulls immediacy. Mixed metaphors (“reef-shadow joy”) are self-consistent within the marine shell imagery. No loops or typos; closure line is clean propulsion, though earlier figurative density edges toward purple in places.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but three successive “as” clauses in the climax dilute immediacy. Figurative language is dense throughout—almost every sentence carries a metaphor; the pattern is not taught, so it feels decorative rather than structural. No synonym loops or scaffolding, but “light bloomed / light intensified / light faded” is a soft paraphrase chain. Closure image is clear, but the preceding pile-up of ethereal conceits blunts its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence advances mood, motive, or milieu. No scaffold loops; paragraph cut test passes. Metaphors coherent (inkwell as key, symphony as trust) and kept to strategic beats rather than every sentence. Final line lands with clean cadence and image-propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high: brass links glinting double as poetic cipher and spatial guide. Metaphors remain consistent—volcano as lungs, chain as lifeline—with no mixed vehicles. Paraphrase loop noted above costs −0.3; otherwise scaffolding is minimal. The final line (“He had trembled, but he had not broken”) lands with crisp percussive echo.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is musical, with purposeful repetition of “bloom/withering,” “dust,” “echo,” creating accumulative cadence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; metaphors stay coherent. High information density: one sentence often layers setting, emotional state, and metaphor (“meteorite chip…symbol of her attempt to balance the blooming and withering parts of her soul”). Small over-richness in abstract nouns (“void,” “echo,” “possibility”) keeps it just below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid template. Figurative language selective (“stars trapped in a jar”) without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; information dual-loaded. Minor filter verbs acceptable under lyric mode. Final glass/sunset image crisp, no mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene pulses; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay consistent (constellation etchings, migratory seeds) without muddled physics. Information density high: single lines layer tool-action, memory-fracture, emotional corollary. Some elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “recollectionist”) risks register drift but fits the invented craft; does not obscure causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths contract slightly during bishop leaps to mimic tempo. Overwriting is disciplined, but two stock strings (“hum of daily life,” “threads in a tapestry”) and a paraphrase loop (“path foreclosing… forecloses a path” in reflection) dull specificity. No mixed metaphors or causality breaks; information density is high. Final image lands cleanly, but the ornamental clichés keep the prose short of 7+ polish.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.7)
    Figurative density is high but patterned and payoff-bearing (dust = galaxy, petals = pages). No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Two paraphrase loops (“glow intensifying with every heartbeat” echoes “glowing faintly”) and one filter verb stack (“seemed to exhale”) keep it from 8+. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into final spin, then cuts to sentinel halt—effective breath control.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; sentences vary, no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated phrasing—“threshold for noctilucent reckonings”—is within Elias’s reflective register and pattern-taught early, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“he thought of...”) recycles opening reflection. Metaphors stay coherent—porcelain/body parallelism sustains internal logic. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory memory, symbolic weight, and present action. Two near-paraphrase lines (“weight of others’ sorrows” / “carry his own”) dock 0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats; clarity intact at closure. Final image is crisp, recharging “cracks glow” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences breathe with tidal cadence; variation in length and opener prevents drumbeat. Figurative language is selective—centuries of oceanic caress, tide-polished walls—and pays off in closure image. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One participle opener is properly sequential; no scaffolding artifacts. Clean copy, high density, propels to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Figurative language is selective: “ivy… breathing with whispers” and “walls seemed to pulse” appear only at pressure beats, avoiding density overload. One scaffold lapse—“the walls seemed to close in, their dreams growing louder, more insistent” repeats the same verb cluster; −0.3. Otherwise sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No mixed metaphors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates with tension—short fragments during mirage resistance, expansive sentence at mirror surrender. Information density high: “sunlight fractured through the wet glass, casting a spectrum” simultaneously reveals setting, tool, and stakes. No scaffold loops or contradictory metaphors. Tense stable; paragraph cuts are purposeful; final line avoids explanatory tag.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with beats; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—only “fires flickering like distant stars” risks cliché but stays functional. Information density is high; each paragraph advances image or pressure. One scaffold slip: “the weight of her mission more acutely than ever” is abstract summary where embodied specificity is due; keeps the score south of 8.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; figurative language is selective (“earth shimmered like a cracked mirror”) and physically coherent. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Occasional template cadence (“She had…, She wore…, She followed…”) opens three sentences in paragraph 2—minor scaffold, not closure-touching. Hedging is minimal. Strong noun/verb choices (“billowed,” “clutched,” “shimmered”). Meets high-band baseline for line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors avoided—“lullaby of conformity” is sustained, not contradicted. Density remains high: each sentence advances image or causality. Occasional elevated register (“bodily poetic grace,” “conceptual repricing”) drifts slightly above POV lexicon but is consistent with mythic tone; not enough to ding. Final third clean; 9+ still disallowed by external-cost gap, not line artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; metaphor string (“meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphanies”) is limited and pattern-taught early. Occasional elevated phrases (“conduit for half-lit epiphanies”) verge on register drift but stay within artist’s lexicon. Information density high—each sentence advances interior or object. Final line earns cadence shift, no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: each image does double duty (moth wing = transformation + fragility). Only minor loop risk—“blushing stillness” repeated twice within 60 words—yet the phrase is motif-charged so the echo feels intentional rather than scaffold. Strong read-aloud rhythm, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with braid motion; sentence variety avoids cadence loops. Figurative language is sparse but apt—“frozen cathedral,” “whispered secrets”—never stacked. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and tool detail. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only minor adjectival softening (“shimmering veil”) prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is controlled—one metaphor per beat, each extending the vine/light motif. One mixed moment (“vines curled like serpents” beside “ethereal grit”) lightly blurs tone but does not touch the closure beat. Information density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent and clear, with only minor scaffold (“his eyes scanning,” “his frugal nature had always”). Metaphors are safe (“bridge to the future”) and not repeated excessively. Information density is moderate; several sentences could compress two ideas into one. No grammar stumbles, but cadence is flat—lacks acceleration toward the culminating moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with beats—longer sentences for Elara’s persuasion, clipped fragments for Kael’s resistance. No scaffold loops; “broken” recurs only when meaning reweights at end. Figurative language is restrained: “resentment had hardened into a shell” is apt, not mixed. One near-purple line “reality itself seemed to pause” is forgiven because the sanctuary’s rule has been established. Proofing is clean; tense stable; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or paraphrase stacks; each sentence advances breath, glass, or fog state. Figurative language is spare and precise—“glass mountains” appears once, earned by context. Information density high: one sentence often fuses sensory cue, tool state, and emotional tilt. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“she was ready to cross”) resolves by action, recharging “boundary” motif. Minor nip: “otherworldly energy” flirts with cliché but is immediately re-cast through tactile repair, so artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences deliver sensory data, world rule, and emotional tilt. Figurative control high—“branches heavy with fruit, leaves rustling with secrets” stays within arboreal logic. Occasional scaffold (“a testament to…”) is minor and outside closure beat. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Final line earns its lift: “ribbon’s faint glow lingered” is monosyllabic fade that mirrors light dying outside.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm flexes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective (“captured starlight”) and paid off in closure image. Minor scaffold: consecutive abstract nouns (“beautiful, inexplicable, and unsettling”) could compress, but do not dull final line. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; prop tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; few scaffolding loops. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal energy,” “conceptual repricing”) fits linguist POV. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop: “shifting corridors” / “shifting walls” within 40 words −0.2. Peak beat (plucking blossom) is crisp, uncluttered. Copy clean; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but borderline overwritten: three stacked metaphors in open (“hazy embrace…rusted hull groaning…haunting melody”) create purple tinge; mixed metaphor “bloom like flowers” for names is faintly cliché. Several paraphrase loops (“memories altered…memories shifting…memories” within 60 words). Otherwise clean grammar, strong verbs, good paragraph rhythm. Artifacts touch neither closure nor causality, so mid-7 band holds.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is lean: each sentence advances image or action; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ticking symphony,” “labyrinth, each curve and line a clue”) flirts with purple but stays within POV lexicon. A single mixed metaphor—“bridge between what was and what could be”—dulls the final paragraph, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template runs. Information density good—each sentence advances image or motion. Mixed metaphors absent, but occasional elevated diction (“cacophony of power”) nudges above POV lexicon. One paraphrase loop: “gently luminous glow” echoed immediately; minor. Closure line is clean, resonant. Good polish, not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language is patterned (glass hums, star song) and recharged at closure, avoiding purple overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are crisp. One tiny simultaneity hiccup (“as she adjusted…she noticed”) but clarity intact. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety good. Occasional metaphor stacking (“liquid moonlight”, “whispered faintly”) without pattern payoff → −0.3. One paraphrase loop: “whispered secrets of the past” echoed by “chorus of forgotten stories” → −0.2. Otherwise lean syntax, high info density, clean mechanics. No artifacts near closure; final image crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid, with purposeful anaphora and clause-variation that propels the ritual pace. Occasional velvet overlay ("shimmered faintly in the fading light") risks purple but stays within voice. No loops, paraphrase churn, or mixed metaphors; spatial and temporal sequences stay clear. One dangling participle and two adjective stacks nudge it off perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: no scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or synonym churn. Sentence variety strong; paragraph cuts tight. One high-pressure beat—“jade cicada grew warm…melody that resonated”—uses figurative density purposefully and pays off in closure image. Minor elevation toward “celestial tapestry” poeticism acceptable under lyric lens. Clean copy, no artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths contract during climb, expand during reflection. Metaphors are lean and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold—three consecutive sentences beginning “She …” in paragraph 3—creates a faint drumbeat, not severe enough to obscure causality. Information density high; each sentence either advances altitude or interior charge. No line-level artifact touches the final image, so stays within high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, loop-free; sentence openings vary. Figurative language sparse, avoiding mixed metaphors. Information density high—each sentence advances discovery or image. One scaffold trace: “the stairway of ascension” repeated three times without new charge; minor. No typos, tense stable. Final line lands on image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence rhythm modulates: opening lyrical cadence, clipped fragments at flare (“The sanctuary erupted…”), return to longer close. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Metaphors stay coherent—starlight/remnants, scars/tethers. One near-mix: “suffocating presence” is abstract; replacing with concrete sensation (cold filament tightening lungs) would sharpen. Clean grammar, pronoun clarity, zero typos.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors are coherent (“light coalescing into a portal”). One mixed moment—“rivers of memory” beside “equations shimmered like stars”—is minor. Information density high; every sentence advances image or beat. Closure line is crisp and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean, but “forgotten dreams,” “whispered secrets,” “weight of centuries” are familiar phrase clusters that blunt specificity. Several filter-verb stacks (“she felt the standing waves… she saw flashes… she heard whispers”) dull immediacy in the visionary climax. No loops obscure causality, yet metaphor density spikes in a short span without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density: a single sentence often layers sensory cue, memory shard, and symbolic charge (“ink seeping into his skin like a tattoo”). Only minor loop: “patterns…patterns…” in adjacent clauses; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: single sentences fold scent, sight, and backstory (“sagging under the weight of lives reduced to manila folders”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle or pressure. Metaphors are spare and organic—“forgotten promises,” “dust shimmered as if approving”—avoiding purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges the dust motif.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing”-level abstraction appears only in the broadcast moment, justified by stakes. Information density strong; each sentence layers action, object, and atmosphere without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; only minor scaffold (“the once orderly seed sorter had become…”) repeats known info. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high through the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines do double duty: “needle that spun wildly, as if searching for direction” marries action + metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Only hairline slip: two adjacent “as if” clauses in one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly propulsive; scaffolding minimal. Strong nouns/verbs outweigh modifiers, though “luminous regret” and “weight of names” flirt with abstraction. One paraphrase loop inside vision paragraph (“of choices, of names, of lives”) but it mirrors oral litany, so lenient. Mixed-metaphor risk in “thread waiting to be pulled” beside “fractured and in need of redemption” only grazes clarity. Closure line breathes cleanly; no artifact touches it.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean: no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm pulses—variation in sentence length mirrors breathing of gorge echoes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallises image without overwriting. Only minor scaffold: “the sound echoing through the gorge like a forgotten song” adds a second vehicle where one suffices, but it does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned early (“trees hummed”) and paid off at climax. One paraphrase loop around “pain into purpose” is minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sensory verbs stay specific. Final sentence lands with imagistic snap, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“His fingers traced the intricate engravings” = tactile detail + character expertise). No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary. Figurative language sparse and apt (“facade now a crumbling reminder”). One mixed metaphor flagged: “weightless burden” is abstract cliché, but isolated. Closure line is crisp, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“clouds… cradling her like a cradle” is the single mixed vehicle). No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks appear. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored; paragraph cuts are purposeful. The elevated register fits the lyric mode without drifting into purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences breathe during calms, tighten during trespass. High information density—each sentence advances premise or stakes. Two near-paraphrases (“a civilization that had crumbled eons ago” / “the civilization lost”) create minor loop; not at closure. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; figurative language is selective, not stacked. One mixed metaphor—“gears wilting near dishonesty”—is forgivable. Opening and closing lines carry image-based punch. Occasional template cadence in travel montage (“through forests… across rivers…”) is minor. Information density is high; no scaffold or synonym churn obscures causality. Closure sentence lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence starts vary, paragraphs breathe. Two scaffold spots—"the air smelled of rust and rain" and "scent of petrichor" echo without new pressure; minor loop −0.2. Figurative language is restrained; metaphors (silent sentinels) are familiar but not mixed. Information density is decent but not remarkable; some sentences could carry double duty. Copy is clean; no typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, image-dense; sentences open varied, no template cadence. One paraphrase loop—“patterns seemed to dance / forming images of people, places, and events she couldn’t comprehend”—subtracts fractionally. Metaphors stay physically coherent (storm-as-plotter). No artifact touches closure; the final line’s turbine-hum reprise is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Figurative language is dense but patterned and coherent—“dawning hush” recurs without mixed metaphors. One scaffold pair detected: “She knew…she realized” in closing paragraph; it is brief and does not touch closure. No synonym loops or template cadence. Information density is high; each sentence advances motive, image, or time. Clean proofing; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentence craft clean: strong verbs (“traced,” “clutch,” “stirred”), no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Information dense; each sentence layers image + motive. Minor overwriting: “dark whisper” + “mirror of the sky” within 3 sentences approaches figurative overload; since pattern not taught, deduct −0.3. No artifact touches closure beat. Overall propulsion strong; 8.1 reflects near-publishable polish with hairline excess.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences for vision, staccato “Then another, and another” for acceleration. Figurative language is spare—only “windows like empty eyes”—keeping attention on the miraculous literal. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new light or texture. Final line lands on image, not explanation, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, tactile, and propulsive—no filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops. Metaphors (“fruit that seemed to hum”) are sparse, precise, and internally consistent. Opening and closing lines act as tonal brackets without self-conscious flourish. One near-slip: “archive emotional patterns” appears twice in summary voice; if cut to one, the line-level would be flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm remains fluid, but abstract nouns (“chaos and calm,” “vortex inheritance”) cluster without concrete anchoring, softening immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet explanatory phrasing (“she realized…”) pads beats that could be imaged.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, but three consecutive “as if” clauses in the bell crescendo blur physical logic. Slight scaffold: “the air seemed to hold its breath” followed immediately by “the air seemed to thicken.” Information density high; no closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrase (“eternal canvas”) skirts register edge but stays in POV’s awe. High density achieved through verb choice (“etched,” “plummeted,” “rooted”).

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse; “whispering pines” is stock, but no metaphor storm clogs the climax. Sentences advance; paragraph cut test passed. A few filler tags (“it seemed”) dilute immediacy but do not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm is adequate, not musical.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate, paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. Figurative language is dense but patterned—mirror-lagoon, woven dawns—teaching its texture early, so density feels intentional rather than purple. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; props track cleanly. Minor scaffold: ‘his eyes fixed on the kite’ / ‘his gaze drifting to the horizon’ is a synonym loop, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lean scaffolding; information density high—“copper wire, once wrapped around oak branches to guide their growth, now served as a reminder” triple-functions as tool, history, and map. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; final paragraph repetition of “orchard whispered” is purposeful cadence, not artifact. Occasional filter (“seemed to hum”) is voice-motivated, not clustered.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; only minor scaffold (“the tower, once…now…”) and one near-paraphrase loop (“shared curiosity and longing” vs “shared purpose”). Metaphors stay coherent (rainwashed stone, circuit of light). No artifact touches closure. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Register holds; slight poetic lift acceptable for speculative lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is steady; sentences vary in length and hinge. Occasional stacked metaphors (“twilight’s embrace”, “whisper that carried centuries”) risk purple tint but match tone. No loops or scaffold; clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean and vivid; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates from long descriptive lines to short declaratives at the reveal. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or action. One near-filter verb (“he realized”) is acceptable; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, occasionally lush—“its colors returning to their natural brilliance”—but metaphor density stays controlled. One paraphrase loop: “sky had been wrong for months, its hues shifting…” restates prior line. No scaffolding or synonym churn in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image efficiently. Minor cliché toll: “harsh realities of survival” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, no scaffold loops; sentences layer image and idea efficiently. Figurative control high: “echoes… weight of forgotten conversations” is concrete metaphor that pays off in final whisper shift. No mixed metaphors or purple clusters. One filter-verb patch in opening—“She felt a kinship”—but quickly moves to tactile action. Final paragraph’s repetition of “small gesture” is purposeful callback, not template cadence. Clean copy, strong paragraph rhythm, read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful sentence variety; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative density spikes only once at climax (“storm within her broke”) and is earned. Occasional elevated diction (“labyrinthine,” “conceptual repricing”) fits seer persona but borders on registry drift; clarity intact. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive, no buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, largely free of scaffold/loop; metaphor density peaks mid-story but stays purposeful. One mixed-metaphor instance: “woven hush” + “tapestry’s border” + “fray” + “knots” within three sentences causes minor coherence wobble. Pacing breathes appropriately, paragraphs varied. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; opening and final lines anchor and echo effectively. Proofing: two comma splices and a vague temporal marker (“Hours passed, or perhaps only minutes”) keep this shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but never purple; each image advances atmosphere or pressure. No loops or synonym churn; “mist,” “echo,” “spire” recur with evolving function. Opening and closing lines bookend with mirror metaphor, supplying pattern payoff. Occasional elevated diction (“refract,” “ethereal”) is justified by ritual frame; one strained participle phrase mid-text keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can establish smell, motion, and emotional tilt. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs like ‘bobbed,’ ‘his,’ ‘jangled.’ Varied sentence lengths mirror rocking tempo of workshop. Zero mixed metaphors; mechanical metaphors stay consistent with gear world.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Occasional soft filler—“somehow complete,” “lighter than it had been”—dulls density slightly. No mixed metaphors; “whispered secrets” is stock but brief. Loops are minor; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is smooth, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the scent of the garden” repeated 3×) slows momentum. Metaphors are coherent—“invisible thread,” “screaming tenderness”—and stay within lyrical register. No mixed vehicles or register drift. Peak beat (cork inhale) is dramatized, not summarized. A few adjective stacks (“blues and grays,” “quiet strength”) border decorative but do not obscure causality. Overall read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; sentences advance without hedges. Density drops in mid-section where “she scavenged parts… the work was grueling… her hands raw” paraphrases the same beat three ways, sapping momentum just before the device awakens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences do two jobs (move, evoke, reveal). Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Loop check clean: no synonym churn or template cadence; scaffold-free. One paraphrase ripple (“fractured grace” echoed twice in closing paragraph) is purposeful reprise, not redundancy. Opening and final lines anchor and release with image economy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Information-dense: one sentence often sets mood plus advances plot (“The mist clung… but not his resolve”). Metaphors stay single-track (“mist… like a second skin”) and do not stack. Minor scaffold: repeated “softly persistent” phrase acts as intended motif but appears three times in identical form; loses some musical freshness. No clarity or closure obscured, so remains above 7.7 floor.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“sky was a deep violet”—without purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges “maps…alive with possibility.” One near-scaffold: “relic of a world long gone” could be cut, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and image density; occasional modifier stacks (“jagged archway…lacy menace”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall propulsion; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph recycles “fireflies of summer” verbatim—minor artifact yet does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-sentence of twilight description contracts into staccato “This is it.” No mixed metaphors; shell equals palette equals anchor—vehicles stay coherent. Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors glow, signals success, reweights friendship). Only minor scaffold: “as if the very fabric of reality were bending” is a stock comparative; it lands outside the closure beat so caps remain untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is taut, image-dense, and loop-free; figurative language is selective (“feral nostalgia,” “shattered mirror”) and never clusters in high-pressure beats. Opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly; no scaffold or paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyric-compressed yet propulsive; sentences multitask (“its windows fogged with the breath of ancient mechanisms” sets tone, place, and metaphor). No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances situation or emotion. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple drift, e.g., “echoes of countless births” is single allowed poetic reach and is grounded in tactile handling of screw. Ear-test rhythm is varied; opening long sentence contrasts with clipped final line, underscoring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences carry double duty (steam curls + mingles with mist). One paraphrase loop: “time felt elastic, stretching and contracting like the breath she now held” immediately followed by “her breath caught” creates conceptual echo—deduct −0.2. No mixed metaphors; crow-quill-as-frost is single, sustained vehicle. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are spare and grounded—“ghostly flower” is single, apt, dropped before purple risk. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges scent motif. One near-filter verb stack (“seemed to hum, seemed to sigh”) forgiven because pattern hum is diegetically taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences double-load atmosphere and concept. Minor template cadence in “the witness… the witness…” repetitions, but loops never obscure causality or dull the exit image. Figurative language stays internally consistent—spiral, thread, hush—without mixed-metaphor clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm accelerates at keyfall, then lengthens to mirror horizon revelation. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphor “sea of mist” is singular and paid off when mist clears. Opening and closing lines book-end with whistle blows, creating sonic bracket. Minor −0.2 for two adverbials (“barely audible,” “softly clink”) that could be compressed, but they do not stall momentum or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and vivid, with strong verb choices (“pulsed softly,” “cutting through the bioluminescent haze”). No looped phrasing or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor over-writing in descriptive stacking (“sprawling labyrinth of glowing fungi, pulsed softly, casting an ethereal light”) but momentum recovers quickly. Closure line avoids cadence monotony and ends on an active image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid clutter. One paraphrase loop (“the way he had gambled…”) and one stock phrase (“like a river breaking through a dam”) slightly dull momentum. No scaffolding or synonym churn in peak beats. Copy is polished; pronoun and tense stable. Meets high-band technical bar but not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “walls slick… painted in streaks of rust” packs sight, texture, decay in one stroke. No synonym loops; each sensory hit advances mood or choice. Metaphors stay internally consistent (tunnel as crypt, melody as language). Final line is crisp, breathing space after sonic crescendo. Minor tick: “steady, steady vibration” is a deliberate echo but flirts with template cadence—does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional elevated phrasing (“breathed only when the wind rustled”) stays within the lyrical register. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed image—“ivy curling like nature reclaiming its own” (ivy is nature)—is minor. Final paragraph leans on abstract nouns (“hope,” “connection”) but does not muddle the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: “constellations paused” does world-building and temporal anchoring in four words. Metaphors are consistent (silence as liquid, melody as breadcrumb). One scaffold detected: “quiet blaze of determination” borders cliché but saved by context. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, few filter verbs. One metaphor run in the void paragraph (“sea of light and shadow… kaleidoscope of possibility”) risks purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No scaffold loops; sentences vary. Minor simultaneity glitch: “She raised it, feeling the weight…” implies two beats at once, but clarity survives. Keeps propulsion and earns its density.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and largely loop-free; occasional adjective pairs (“joy and sorrow”) are earned by emotional crest. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop—“the camera had no film, no mechanism to do so”—is tolerated because it flags the impossibility that powers closure. Rhythm modulates with the gestural beats, propelling the accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“they knew,” “they realized”) that dulls immediacy in two spots. Metaphors are restrained and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Two instances of “they” opener clustering and one overlong sentence at the scroll beat keep it shy of 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no scaffold loops, no synonym churn. Occasional stacked modifiers (“auroral sorrow,” “liquid memory”) flirt with purple but serve texture and are paid off at closure. Sentence variety strong; no template cadence runs. Opening and final lines carry image-weight without overwriting. Minor density tax for figurative saturation in mid-paragraph, but it supports rather than obscures closure. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences vary in length; opening pair of long clauses breathes, later fragments mirror storm urgency. No synonym loops or template cadences; “walk” recurs but is focal, not filler. One mixed metaphor: “air smelled of salt and rust” is concrete, but “salt and rust” as aroma is slightly off. Final line lands clean without scaffold; momentum carries through the lit passage.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for guardian’s stillness, shorter fragments when stranger speaks. Figurative language is spare—only “pebbles into a stream” simile—avoiding purple clutter. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Final paragraph’s mirror-star linkage is crisp, no mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, largely loop-free; occasional poetic overlap (“amplified quiet” repeated with small variation) but not scaffold-heavy. Metaphors stay coherent—grotto as cradle—no mixed vehicles. Information density dips in mid-paragraph backstory capsule; could compress “he had always been attuned…” block. No artifacts touch closure beat; final sentence breathes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, with high information density; no scaffolding or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors (“whale’s tail curled around a heart”) are physically impossible yet feel dream-legible, so waived. Final paragraph drifts toward template cadence: “freedom was found not in escape…” subtracts immediacy. Otherwise ear-test clean; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrase (“conceptual void she had mastered”) nudges toward abstraction but occurs outside the closure beat. Strong sentence variety and paragraph cuts that advance stakes. One mixed moment: “morally ambiguous figure” is tell-phrasing that could be shown through riskier action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences layer metaphor upon metaphor, but each adds a new sensory angle rather than restating, achieving high density. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long clauses build, then short fragments mirror ice shards. Occasional elevated register (“atrium,” “paraphrase”) fits the aesthete POV, so no register drift penalty, yet metaphor abundance nudges toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; figurative language is selective (“captured rainbows,” “symphony of grays”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Occasional elevated phrasing—“conceptual repricing” territory—e.g., “transcend the absence of hue” skirts abstractness but remains anchored to Elias’s longing. Minor scaffold: “had found it weeks ago” tells backstory in one efficient clause, acceptable under 800-word limit. Final line lands with image punch, no drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold; only minor paraphrase loops (“sounds of… echoes of…”) intrude. Figurative language is restrained and coherent—lens as “key,” “symphony of whispers”—without mixed-metaphor clutter. High information density is achieved through sensory triangulation; each sentence advances atmosphere or concept. No artifact touches the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong information density: “shaping silver into delicate mourning bands” does world, occupation, and mood in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting at “curtains of intention shimmered faintly, as if charged with energy” where “as if” softens an otherwise declarative marvel.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, high-density, no loops; figurative language is selective (“rain tapped…Morse code”). One mixed metaphor—“Tower card pulsing faintly, as if alive”—is tolerable. Opening and closing lines bookend with cadence shift. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences open with prepositional lyricism then contract to “She understood then.” Figurative density is high but patterned and taught early—metallic lattice, liquid gold—so no −0.3 for overwrite. Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn between “amber and indigo.” Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous. Final line lands with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “a world she rarely visited anymore” echoes “world below the clouds” in adjacent sentences—minor −0.2. Strong nouns/verbs (“shimmered like captured sunsets,” “sky melted”) avoid purple. Closure line varies cadence effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, read-aloud fluid; only minor scaffold (“layers of…layers of…”) and one mixed metaphor (“quiet reminder of fragile convictions”). No loops near closure; final sentence lands with cadence lift. Density strong—most lines do two jobs. Could trim two adjectives (“shimmering stillness” repeated) to reach 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are consistent—time as frost, memory as sand—avoiding mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence layers mood, object, and motion (“stone walls whispering secrets only the morning light could decipher”). Minor scaffold: “the weight of it grounding her” is vague tactile shorthand, but does not obscure causality. Closure line (“quiet hum of peace”) risks soft abstraction yet functions as cadence release; no artifact touches the final image, so momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, scaffold-free; sentence openings vary, no loops or paraphrase. Information density high—each sentence advances image, motive, or causality. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“whisper of history,” “hushed thunder”). No artifacts in closure beat; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and musical—“aurora painted the sky in hues of emerald and violet”—yet avoids purple by keeping metaphors consistent (sky as canvas, stardust as pigment). No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes poise. Minor scaffold: “She sat…she rested” repeats posture, but within a single beat; does not blunt closure. Overall read-aloud rhythm is sustained and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is clean; sentence openings vary. Two mild scaffold spots: “its light… its light” in adjacent clauses; “the dune whispered… the dune responded” repeats noun+verb frame. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density is good—each line advances image or action. Closure beat is free of figurative muddle. Minor synonym churn (“glowing… luminescent… shimmering”) dampens precision.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose breathes with scene needs; parallax of metallic vines vs. heartbeat blooms keeps density high. One scaffold loop: “for all its beauty… a void where insight should have been” is restated in adjacent clauses. No mixed metaphors; final paragraph tightens into resonant cadence. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional tempo; paragraph cuts are purposeful. No loops or synonym churn; “silence” repetition is thematic, not scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“notes… frostbitten hope”—but stays legible. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-action. Clean grammar, strong verbs, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies, but metaphor strings stack (“weight of centuries”, “shadow cast by false light”) in high-pressure beats without payoff, causing −0.3. Paraphrase loop: “write your truth… facade cracked… kingdom saw them” repeats collapse idea across three sentences. Otherwise clean grammar, sharp paragraphing; no typos or pronoun drift.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clean, high-density, no loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and exact—“sentinel against the horizon” stands without clutter. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propulsive. Register stays within a scientist’s diction; no corporate drift. One Clause-packed sentence mid-epiphany could breathe more, but it does not touch the closure beat. Typos, tense, pronoun reference immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, loop-free; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (stars as living constellations, hum as sleeping beast). Information density high—each sentence layers setting, object, and emotional charge. Occasional elevated register (“a margin of illumination before dusk fully claimed the sky”) fits the operatic frame, but two abstract intensifiers (“thunderous serenity”) risk sonic overkill yet are pattern-taught early. No artifacts touch closure; final line is imagist and taut.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; only minor scaffold: “a stark contrast to the memories that haunted Zara” is abstract summary that could be cut. Metaphors (“fluttered like a wounded bird”) are singular and apt; no mixed-vehicle pile-ups. One paraphrase loop—“the world that had since shattered / a world that had since shattered”—is repeated concept within two sentences, costing −0.2. Closure sentence sails without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, yet propulsive—no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes immediately. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (cards as shattered mirror, threads of despair) are clean and integrated. Paragraph cuts carry emotional turns. Minor: four instances of “luminescent ache” could feel churned, but each re-inflects meaning, so forgiven. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences twin-job (image + interiority). No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and precise. Occasional slight filter (“seemed to”) but not clustered. Paragraph cuts are purposeful; opening line anchors stakes, final line releases image. Clean grammar and spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is acceptable, but “the library’s silence” is reused four times within 700 words, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls immediacy. Overwriting intrudes: “echoing faintly in the vast space” is redundant after “echoing library.” Mixed metaphor—“a ghost in the machine”—is dropped without payoff. Information density is moderate; several sentences could lose “that” clauses. No typos or pronoun drift, but micro-scaffold remains.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences usually twin-job (develop atmosphere + advance beat). No scaffold loops; metaphors mixed only once (“tranquil blaze”) but flagged intentionally for tone. Opening line anchors stakes and scent; final line re-weights “quiet.” Punctuation clean, no simultaneity errors. One paraphrase pocket: “shadow she could never fully escape” restated later as “father-shadow,” minor −0.2, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, with high density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and micro-action. Figurative language is patterned early (“silence had a voice”) and paid off, avoiding purple accretion. A few soft repeats—“silence,” “lullaby” used three times in closing paragraph—could be trimmed, but they do not obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“orbits of regret”) skirts purple but stays anchored to theme. Information density strong; no scaffolding loops. A few conceptual repeats (“echoing”) are negligible and don’t dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is mostly clean: strong verbs, no paraphrase loops, punctuation correct. A few soft modifiers (“tirelessly,” “relentless”) could be trimmed; one mixed metaphor (“constellation tattooist… hush the dissonance”) is minor. Rhythm breathes with scene pace. No artifacts touch the closure beat; final sentence lands with imagistic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    High信息密度; most sentences perform double duty (atmosphere + interiority). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Metaphors are coherent within grotto logic. No adjacent paraphrase loops. Scaffold-free. One mixed metaphor (“reluctant lover” + “emergent hush”) but does not blunt closure. Proofing clean. Minor −0.2 for decorative alliteration in “lilac unease” used thrice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    Strong openers—“skeletal silhouette against the shattered sky”—but mid-passages slip into synonym loops: “mercy had become aberrant, a weakness…mercy was no longer aberrant but essential.” Three consecutive sentences open “Elara…” creating template cadence. Metaphors hold—tessera as key, plaza as beacon—but density thins when abstraction replaces image. Closure line avoids artifact, ending on sensory renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but leans on metaphor strings in adjacent sentences (“silver light filtering… shadows… secrets… hues of sound”) creating light density drag. No loops or paraphrase; each sentence adds new sensory layer. Strong verbs (“swaying,” “bleeding,” “shimmering”) and concrete nouns outweigh modifiers. Closure image is clear. One mixed metaphor: “timeline fractured most visibly… air shimmering like heat over a flame” compresses abstract and concrete without teaching the rule, keeping score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean, no scaffold loops; figurative language is selective (“swirling tapestry of blues and silvers”) and tied to camera optics. One mixed risk—“ethereal hum” borders filler—but density remains high: each sentence advances setup or emotional layering. Final line earns resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“began to notice,” “began to see”) appears. Information density is moderate—some sentences serve only atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent: fossil “hum” and “pulse” extend the bio-mapper’s sensory metaphor set. The final third avoids artifacts, but earlier floating beats contain echoing participial openers that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean: no filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold-ish loop—“the echo was not just a sound but a fragment...a truth waiting”—is forgiven because it teaches the accreting pattern. Information density is high; single sentences often fuse sensory, symbolic, and motive work (“She arranged them in rows, their shapes and colors forming a mosaic of forgotten lives”). Ear-test rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ear-test passes: varied sentence length, no template cadence runs. Phrases such as “codes in accumulated snow” are dense and do double duty. Occasional elevated register (“vouchsafe,” “Conceptual Repricing” echo) fits burned-spy diction. One paraphrase loop—fixing/remembering courage iterated—costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors; props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with purposeful repetition of “percolate,” “palimpsest,” “spindrift.” Figurative layering dense but consistent; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) slightly above coachman’s likely lexicon, yet doesn’t rupture lyric contract. Strong read-aloud cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Density high: one line couples sensory heat to emotional pressure—“sun beat down relentlessly” parallels internal relent. Metaphors are coherent (glass heartbeat) and internally consistent. Final-line propulsion: “time had found its rhythm again” gives cadence payoff without explanatory bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with only one soft paraphrase pair (“the world held its breath / world seemed to stand still”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple inflation. High information density: each sentence layers light, plant, tooth, or oar detail without stall. Final third is artifact-free, allowing the quiet closure to resonate. Near 9-band but occasional adjective drift (“soft glow,” “gentle breeze”) keeps it just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; no paraphrase loops, scaffold, or synonym churn detected. Figurative language sparse and precise (“clouds swirled like a restless sea”)—single metaphor, cleanly handled. Information density high: each sentence advances setting, motive, or mythos without padding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line crystallizes image with cadence shift. Clean grammar, varied paragraph lengths, no tense drift. Minor alliteration is pattern-taught and pays off orally.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from languid pond sentences to the staccato gasp of crowd reaction. Figurative layers (prismatic quiet, marble petals) are sparse enough to stay lucid; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“the thread that connected all things” is repeated in motive and echo—drops the score a notch. Otherwise density is high: every clause either refracts light or advances Elara’s interior tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “stack of astronomical charts” doubles as visual and character tool in five words. Mixed metaphors are absent; “universe was full of tricksters” is abstract but immediately re-grounded via subwoofer mechanics. No template cadence or synonym loops. One minor scaffold: “the signal wasn’t random—it was structured” could compress, but it occurs early and does not dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is largely clean: varied sentence openings, no template cadence, high information density (“compass needle quivering as if alive” does two jobs: animate object + foreshadow). Minor scaffold: “the nexus was a place of paradoxes—vast yet suffocating” states what the scene already shows; a −0.2 loop. Metaphors stay coherent (needle/organ both vibrate through stone). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final-line star-point uplifts rhythm without forced uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“Her breath visible…chill air”) and one metaphor mix (“clockwork mechanism” vs later organic thread) nudge downward. Density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work—while opening/final lines frame the beam-in-mist image with echoing precision. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “glass domes cracked and fogged, as if the sky itself had wept” does three jobs (visual, foreshadow, theme) in twelve words. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“tornado in reverse”—is fleeting and physically coherent. Line-level artifacts do not touch the closure beat; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) risks overwriting but fits the lyric mode and does not blur causality. Metaphors stay consistent; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic, no scaffold loops; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is sparse and apt—“dusky harmony of shadow and light.” Filter verbs are minimal, keeping immediacy. One mixed metaphor (“fleeting dream” beside “monument to failed ambition”) is forgivable at this length. Clarity never falters; momentum carries straight to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “began to”) could be trimmed. Metaphors are coherent but stack in closing lines (“river of light,” “tapestry of hope”) without fresh sensory payoff, creating mild purple tint. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; pronoun and action order remain clear. Final sentence cadence lands cleanly, but earlier scaffolding (“As she…”) repeats three times—minor template artifact that dulls propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, zero scaffold, high density: each sentence moves setting, body, or stake. Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. Final sentence lands with tactile crispness and conceptual reprice. One near-repeat: “swirling orchard” appears twice; second could be pruned to “spiral of trunks.”

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “The maze shuddered, its hedges shifting as if alive, and the eclipsed covenant began to mend, its light spreading outward like ripples on water.” Only minor loop: “clipping…clipping…” repetition within two sentences; quickly varied. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif. Minor tightening could delete one “seemed,” but artifact never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; sentences layer job-double duty (action + atmosphere). Overwriting threatens in first third—three consecutive “roots/snaked/veins” metaphors—but pattern teaches orchard-as-body and pays off in root-pattern confrontation. No loops or scaffold; minor tautology “bones like ancient veins” could trim. Final line cadence lands cleanly, no artifact interference at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensory data, backstory, and emotional valence. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (echo/silence). Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice. Minor nominalization (“emptiness”) allowed because it internalizes quarry image. Edges 9+ boundary only because one paragraph middle drifts toward template cadence, though not in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences vary in length, no scaffold loops; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” type phrasing) fits academic POV. One mixed metaphor—“knowledge flowing like a river” within vision flood—barely blurs clarity. High density maintained; minor poetic overlay in calm beats does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, world rule (“pool said to be gateway…”) without padding. Figurative layer consistent—tide, moon, winter light—no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cut test passed. Opening and final lines carry imagistic bookends that re-charge “wintersun serenity.” Minor nominalizations (“reconfiguration,” “conceptualization”) allowed if kept; no clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, with only minor loops (“seemed to…” ×3). Figurative language is disciplined—light as heartbeat, caves whispering—and never mutes causality. Information density is high; each sentence layers image or motion. A single paraphrase loop mid-climax prevents 8+ entry, but momentum remains intact to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “gleezing” and “cathedral of decay” deliver metaphor without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the Charged Poise. One mixed metaphor—“cathedral of decay”—is sanctioned by accumulative design and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is spare yet textured—“tang of electricity,” “curled as if waiting”—without modifier glut. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or hum-code. Figurative control holds: reversed time trope stays consistent from arch to watch to quill. One near-scaffold—“she had to document what she found” right after the desk is revealed—could compress, but it does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is sensorily dense yet propulsive; however, two stacked metaphors in the climax (“mend the perforations in the air itself” + “roots twisting as if awakened”) blur the physical logic of what the sound actually does. A minor paraphrase loop—“the violin was more than an object; it was a key, a whisper…”—recycles the same claim without new angle. Otherwise, cadence breathes with the beat, and the final line’s quiet diminuendo lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and scaffold-free; no loops or synonym churn detected. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Occasional elevated phrasing—“threshold of stillness,” “radiant hush”—is motivated by tone poem mode and does not obscure causality. Two minor adjectival stacks (“shimmering aurora,” “silken shrouds”) are acceptable in compressed aesthetic; they do not stall momentum or muddle the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lines are clean, but overwritten cadence in high-pressure beats—“surge of energy coursed through her,” “world around her blurred”—relies on stock abstract metaphors. Near-paraphrase loops (“quiet unrest lingered… yearning she couldn’t name”) repeat interior summary without new pressure. Filter verbs stack (“she felt,” “she saw”) during the vision flood; no artifact touches closure, but density is thinned rather than accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero template cadence or synonym loops; each sentence advances image, motion, or concept. Figurative control disciplined—only two metaphors (cloak, chimes) and both recur with accruing pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with cadence shift—“one chime at a time” echoes opener, sealing the braid. Minor scaffold: “the chimes rang out in a sequence that seemed random but felt deliberate” could lose “that seemed random” without loss, but the line does not recur or dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, loop-free; sentences vary in length and opening. A few soft filters—“she felt the weight,” “her mind slipping”—but they suit meditative tempo. Metaphors (pond rings = time) stay consistent, no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph contains a scaffold sentence (“She spoke of…”) that summarizes the reveal; trimming it would sharpen the image where silence already speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; only minor scaffold (‘their presence as subtle as…’) and one mixed metaphor (‘walls seemed to breathe with whispers’) but clarity intact. High information density—each paragraph layers setting, myth, and interior—without loop artifacts; closure image unmarred.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density: every sentence advances image, motion, or interior tilt. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors are sparse and coherent. Minor scaffold: “lingering luminance” is repeated four times without new inflection, blunting sonic freshness. Filter verbs minimal; opening sentence could drop “got automated” for immediacy, but line-level errors never obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, mostly free of scaffold; only minor softeners (“quiet hum of the harbor”) flirt with cliché. Sentences breathe with paragraph variety; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is restrained; “meteor hush” metaphor is repeated but patterned, not cluttered. Clause density is modest; the piece prioritizes atmosphere over information, acceptable for lyric mode but caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences multi-task (action + image + world-rule). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare, patterned, payoff-attested. One −0.3 for three consecutive “She…” openers mid-text that drum without teaching pattern. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene heat. Closure line is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic; only two adjacent sentences repeat “echo” without new pressure, a minor loop. Metaphors stay coherent—light as shattering glass, monsters as night shards—and serve the beat. No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Opening line anchors tone; final line (“ancient observatory… now held a new echo”) resolves with cadence lift, achieving propulsion without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“the bell’s halves seemed to whisper”). High information density—each sentence layers observation with emotional valence. Minor scaffold: “its crystalline arches reflecting hues of pale blue and lavender” could trim one modifier, but this is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, varied: “boots sank slightly,” “stars beginning to prick,” strong verbs over modifiers. One paraphrase loop—“the town began to resurface, not just physically but emotionally”—costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or artifact clusters; closure image remains crisp. High density achieved: each sentence layers action, sensory cue, and emotional tilt without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, lucid, and sacrifices neither clarity nor momentum; metaphors stay coherent. However, template cadence creeps in (“She… She… She…” openers; repeated “seemed to” qualifiers) and sentiment drifts toward gently purple uplift rather than knife-sharp specificity. No loop obscures closure, but texture stays politely literary rather than unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical but leans on anaphora (“every step was deliberate…”) and stacked similes that edge toward purple in high-pressure beats; density slips slightly. Several conceptual near-repeats (“reminder of survival… reminder that trust could never be broken”) create paraphrase loops, triggering −0.4 template cadence penalty. Opening and closing lines are strong, creating a frame echo. Minor typos/grammar are clean, but overwriting keeps this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openers vary, no template cadence. Information density high—“shards merged with their own”—does triple duty (action, metaphor, cost). Zero loops or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. Only micro-scaffold: “seemed to” appears twice in first 100 words, trimming immediacy −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density: “seed split open… tiny, glowing key” carries spectacle without modifier overload. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elasticity in “orthogonal approaches” (repeated twice) and “storm-born silence” (three variants) but pattern is taught early and pays off in final silence, so allowed. Final third stays clean—no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled—mechanical whine blending with lullaby is intentional, not self-contradictory. No loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif of breath/wind. One minor over-modifier cluster (“strange harmony that felt both broken and whole”) but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: single sentences deliver temperature, mythic whisper, emotional valence. Metaphors stay coherent—light folding, mist reshaping silhouette. One paraphrase loop: “the garden was alive, though not in the way…” followed by near-restatement; minor −0.2. No scaffolding, no tense drift. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line cadence echoes opening mist, recharging motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, with only one template cadence (“her hands… her mind… her resolve”) and no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate—some emotional states are summarized where scene could compress. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-cycle the bloom image effectively. A single paraphrase loop (“failure… despair… failure”) drags slightly in paragraph three, but never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Metaphors are dense—almost every sentence carries a figurative vehicle—but the pattern is taught early (“skeletal fingers”) and culminates in the charged reprise, so density penalty is waived. Occasional soft scaffolding: “She smiled faintly, her heart steady” adds no new pressure. Line clarity is high, no contradictory imagery or tense drift. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “silence” motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean, with purposeful paragraph breaks and no scaffold loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “resiliently positive demeanor”) edges toward academic register not grounded in POV lexicon. Mixed metaphors are absent; rhythm modulates effectively across beats. A single paraphrase loop—“she felt herself stretched thin… she pressed on”—reduces immediacy slightly but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense, propulsive: sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work in single strokes—“floor sprouted roots that coiled upward like living vines” shows environment, agency threat, and simile in one breath. No synonym loops; metaphors stay internally coherent. One mixed image: “light fractured into impossible angles” (angles don’t fracture) nicks −0.2. Otherwise clean, read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, image-rich, and dual-purpose: “towers spiraled upward like inverted stalagmites” world-builds while foreshadowing the hybrid star-alien geometry. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety is good; paragraph cuts are tight. One scaffold loop—“the aliens had changed everything”—is repeated in adjacent beats, a minor −0.2, but it does not touch the closure image. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the anchor-chain motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, looping largely avoided, but several soft adjective stacks (“mist-clad atrium,” “reeling hush”) recur without pattern payoff; “reeling” remains unclear in sensory terms. One paraphrase loop: “her curiosity drove her forward, even as…” restates prior impulse. Strong verbs (“clinging,” “swirled”) and varied sentence openers keep momentum. No grammar slips; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is sonically tuned—silt, pulse, hush—without metaphor pile-up. One scaffold loop: “crashing hush” repeated four times; each use advances beat, so only −0.2. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high; every sentence advances goal or pressure. Final image is clean, no artifact intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    High metaphor density is patterned early and paid off (galaxies → data → closure), so no density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “shard seemed to hum faintly, a vibration she could feel” → redundant; −0.2. Otherwise crisp, propulsive, no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Final line earns image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid, sentence variety strong, few adverbs. One scaffold spotted: “The arrowhead… was cold, its power dormant once more” restates prior beat but acceptable as reset signal. No mixed metaphors; ozone/earthquake imagery stays coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge. Minor paraphrase loop in garden reversion description (−0.2). Overall momentum intact; clarity never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary opening and length, propelling toward the final glowing shell. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles—and diction never drifts above Elara’s lyrical but grounded lexicon. High information density: each line advances image, beat, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Metaphors mostly coherent, though “tapestry of forgotten dreams” edges purple. One paraphrase loop: “silence…possibility” restated in intro & end. No mixed vehicles in climax. Density high; scaffolding minimal. Copy clean beyond one typo (“升幅” in prior comment—ignore, not in source).

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean: each sentence either advances stacking or registers sensory shift; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral mirrors scarf fringe—without mixed-vehicle clutter. One scaffold clause: “its shelves groaning under the weight of bound ideas” could trim to “shelves groaned under bound ideas,” but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure. Final image (“library was more than a building…”) is tell-ish; a single physical beat of her locking the door would sharpen exit, yet the line is brief and doesn’t stall cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: sensory nouns and strong verbs outweigh modifiers; only one mixed metaphor (“shadows seemed to breathe and starlight whispered”) in high-pressure beat, forgiven by lyric mode. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or action. Minor scaffold: “the air was heavy with the scent of forgotten ages” could compress, yet momentum sustains. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle, satisfying 9+ quick test boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, high-density, and loop-free; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors (“skeletal remains,” “world holding its breath”) are clean, non-contradictory, and brief. No synonym churn or scaffold; paragraph cuts test passes. Opening and final lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Minor: “decades later” is repeated three times; trimming one would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long lyrical sentences build density, then snap to shorter declaratives at the payoff. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is disciplined—‘steam curling like whispers’ serves atmosphere without purple drift. Minor filter verbs (‘she believed’) survive but do not cluster in peak beats; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences sway into stacked modifiers (“verdant parapet beside a waterfall, where the air was thick with the scent of blooming flora”) that slow the beat without deepening choice. Occasional paraphrase loops (“she was more than a pruner, more than a weaver—she was a guardian”) create template cadence. Otherwise clean grammar and coherent temporal order.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; sentences carry double duty—action + atmosphere. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay physical (saltwater, glass, thread). One mixed vehicle: “silence…accumulated with every passing moment” treats silence as countable mass, but context absorbs it. Peak beat clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphing breathes with discovery beats. High information density: each sentence layers time, tool, or tactile detail. One paraphrase loop detected (“silence she sought to interpret” echoes prior “interpret silence with empathy”)—minor, non-closure touching, −0.2. Metaphors are coherent (vault as tree rings) and do not collide. No scaffold or template cadence in final third; therefore 9+ ban is waived. Closing line lands cleanly without overwritten glow.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between rolling accumulative lists and hard stops (“It was a key, though she didn’t yet know what it unlocked”) that mimic silt puffs. Information density is high: one line often fuses sensory cue, interior tilt, and foreshadowing. One scaffold pair appears—“she turned it slowly, watching the synthetic snow swirl” is almost restated in adjacent lines, a −0.2 infraction but does not recur at closure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is musical, with clause-length variation that mimics lute phrasing; no template cadence detected. Figurative strings—“spectral presence,” “stardust on the wind”—cluster but stay coherent to ghost/transcendence motif, not muddled. Information density high: each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor scaffold: “She had found it… its purpose long forgotten” could compress, but it doesn’t stall the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud ear varies rhythm; sentences open with participle, noun, preposition in deliberate rotation. Information density high—“her fingers traced the rough bark…vein in a leaf, every crack”—three sensory jobs in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay sky-bound and coherent. One mixed moment: “mirror the sky inside walls” risks abstraction, but the image is immediately grounded in blank-page indentations, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long amber twilight sentences contract into single-line beam commands. Information density high: one sentence can layer engine hum, starling echo, and symbolic pulse. Zero paraphrase loops; “stranded luminance” never repeated without new physical correlate. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Minor purple flicker—“ethereal glow ... suspended in crystalline orbs”—but forgiven as it lands at climax where image reweights theme.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly free of loops; only minor scaffold repeats (“she saw herself… she saw herself…”). Metaphors stay coherent (“air thick with… moonlight” risks mixing states but reads acceptably). No artifacts touch the closure beat, so the high-band cap is not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence variety strong; opening line anchors stakes and scent. Two adjacent “the garden” anaphoras create light loop (−0.2). One mixed metaphor—“past and future tangled like vines, and the present was a fragile blossom”—vines ≠ blossom logic, −0.3. Info density high; no scaffold or synonym churn. Line artifacts do not touch closure beat; clarity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and sensory density; only minor scaffold (“the hush seemed heavier, as if…”) and one mixed metaphor (“blade of hope” is literal beam yet metaphor). No loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language stays coherent under pressure. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    High density—“jagged paths winding between stone pillars weathered by centuries of wind and salt” does three jobs in one breath. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor template cadence in “mechanical birds… mechanical eyes… mechanical gears” (−0.2); otherwise propulsive and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language sparse, river-to-polymer metaphor consistent, no mixed vehicles. High density: “sun dipped low” = time + color + emotional hue. Strong verbs: “swirl,” “dance,” “cling.” Final line crystallizes without adverbs. No artifact in closure third; read-aloud rhythm breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, clauses layered like glass panes, but avoidable scaffold creeps in: “the library seemed to hold its breath, the clouds below swirling in unison” repeats the prior beat’s motion. Metaphors stay coherent (glass orchard / cloud sea) and physically compatible. No synonym loops, no template cadence runs. Density is solid—each sentence layers atmosphere and motion—yet minor pruning could excise two “seemed to” filters without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length; no template cadence detected. Figurative language clustered but patterned (taste/memory) and paid off at closure. High density: “Each line told a story, each curve a memory” compresses cartography and emotion. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”-adjacent) offset by consistent sensory diction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid but leans on abstract intensifiers (“quaking reverie,” “profound transformation”) that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Information density is high—each paragraph advances premise or image. One mixed metaphor (“memories entangled like vines in her mind” alongside “shards of glass”) creates momentary visual blur, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, concrete nouns, no filler adverbs; information density high. One paraphrase loop on “luminescent veins” and a mixed metaphor (“earth held its breath” beside “veins”) keep it from 8-band; no artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, no scaffold sentences. Opening and closing lines serve as melodic bookends, achieving textural resonance. Occasional soft adverbial padding—“deliberate, unyielding”—could be trimmed, but never in high-pressure beats. Read-aloud rhythm is confident; only the repetitive anaphora “her… her…” in paragraph 3 approaches template cadence, kept below penalty threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or motion. Figurative language is sparse, pressure-timed: “twilight draped the sky in hues of indigo and amber” arrives during calm; no mixed metaphors. High information density—basalt dent, covenant history, chess symbolism—woven without exposition dump. Final line—“ready to translate the silence into a new beginning”—re-activates the title verb and closes ear-rhythm cleanly. No artifact touches closure; maintains 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric rhythm avoids drumbeat; sentence length and paragraph cuts breathe with discovery. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or internal shift. Minor scaffold: “the workshop seemed to hold its breath” echoed twice; second instance reads as intentional pattern return at closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; figurative language stays coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence variety good. Occasional elevated register (“journalize,” “conceptual repricing”) fits character but edges close to thesaurus churn once. No mixed metaphors or loops. Information density high; every paragraph advances. One paraphrase loop (“wisdom…serenity…growth”) mildly dulls final third, capping 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose breathes: short percussive clauses during tilt, lyrical elongation at light bloom. Metaphors organic—“shimmering like stars” specific to fruit cuticles, not filler. One paraphrase hiccup: “the planet’s flora thriving despite its chaotic environment” repeats prior beat; minor −0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold loops, high info-density, clean temporal order.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, high-density; no loops or mixed metaphors; occasional elevated fragments (“guts of a giant”) are patterned early and payoff in wreck description; final paragraph drifts toward abstract nouns (“fragility,” “foresight”) slowing cadence—minor artifact keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; short percussive clauses mimic bell strikes, longer liquid lines mirror aurora swirl. Mixed-metaphor risk in “liquid sunlight trapped within ancient resin” is justified by synesthetic lens. No synonym loops; each sensory noun is specific. One scaffold phrase—“the cavern seemed to hold its breath”—is stock, but it sits early, not at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sentences vary openings and length. Information density high—each line moves atmosphere or motive; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; metaphors remain coherent. Occasional elevated register (“gilded reed flute,” “tapestry of colors”) fits mythic tone and stays consistent; closure image unmarred by muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, largely loop-free; only minor paraphrase echo (“changed…in a way that resonated”) could compress. Metaphors stay consistent (tapestry, vessel, chorus) and physically plausible. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No scaffold, purple lists, or strained simultaneity. Final third remains artifact-free, satisfying 9+ hygiene; minor lyrical repetition is purposeful, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion. No loops or scaffold; “luminescent bands…living tapestry” is the only near-purple line but fits aurora scale. Information density high—satchel, pendant, mentor absence, fade boundary all seeded within first 120 words. Final line lands with image that reprises heartbeat motif without syntactic fanfare.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned—light, frost, breath—so density feels earned. No mixed metaphors; quartz, mist, and rainbow keep physical logic intact. Only micro-loop: “the prism… the object… the prism” within 30 words (−0.2). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with her inhalations.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with high image density; occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet so profound it seemed to unravel the very fabric of time”) flirt with overwriting yet stay purposeful. No scaffolds or mixed metaphors obstruct closure. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, propelling the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clean clause variety and strong verbs; only light scaffold (“his resolve quiet but unyielding” repeated in new wrappers). No mixed metaphors or loops that obscure causality. Final lava chamber could use sharper sensory compression under heat stress, but momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean, but mild template cadence appears (“She… She… She…” across three sentence openers mid-forest) and “the world shifted again” is scaffold. Density is high; no mixed metaphors. Final orb image is crisp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors are spare—“luminescent ache”—and never layered. Opening and closing lines frame beam/ache callbacks, creating purposeful echo. A single near-cliché (“heart pounding”) is forgiven under pressure. Overall, line-level craft supports rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; metaphors (sword-of-light, chorus of gratitude) are disciplined, no mixed vehicles or loops. Information density is high—each line advances image or stakes—producing clean propulsion toward the dawn reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the air was thick with…”) repeats familiar tea-house trope. Metaphors remain coherent (sun painted trails), no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers scent, light, social cue. Final paragraph drifts into generic uplift phrasing, dulling last beat. Artifact-free in closure zone; keeps 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty (description + stake), variation keeps momentum; occasional poetic uplift (“repository of scattered dreams”) risks mild purple but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; grammar clean; final line lands with imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies across sentence lengths; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Some metaphor stacked (“fruit that glowed like captured dawns”) risks purple but fits lyric mode. No scaffold loops; a few near-repetitions (“world whispered…whispered to her”) slip in. Proofing clean; pronouns stable. Information density moderate—some sentences do single job.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is spare and coherent—no mixed metaphors. One minor paraphrase loop (“nested paradoxes” / “contradictions” within three lines) but it misses the closure beat. Information density high; sentences multi-task.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, or conceptual information without scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse but precise (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows”) and tied to world logic. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reverence, clipped fragments for tremor. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often slots setting, tone, and motive (“The air smelled of salt and decay as she slipped past vendors...”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“comforting unease,” “fragile truce of hush”) nudges register drift but does not clog urgency. Closure line is crisp, image-driven, without figurative muddle—meets the 7+ bar, falls short of 9+ by micro-flares of lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, with varied sentence lengths and sensory specificity. Occasional “seemed to” filter and soft qualifiers (“inexplicable,” “subtly”) dilute immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet figurative language stays safe—aurora always “dances,” lavender always “shimmers.” Lacks a final dagger line to re-crack the image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong information density—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Metaphors stay coherent (cave as womb), but “after the last echo of laughter fades” is used twice without variance, creating template echo. Minor scaffold: “she realized what she had to do” could be cut; the gesture already shows. Otherwise clean mechanics, no synonym churn or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphs cut cleanly. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught via leaf-glow, paid off at closure. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density high: single sentence often layers sensory cue, interior tilt, and foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; sentence openings avoid monotony. Several soft loops—“moments of wonder…wonder…wonder,” “symphony…symphonies”—dull edge; “glisten” appears four times without re-inflection. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked, reducing density.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, no loops or paraphrase stacks; metaphors are sparse and coherent. Occasional elevated register (“etched with symbols of forgotten terrors”) flirts with purple but stays purposeful. High information density: each sentence advances image or beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, with natural rhythm and varied sentence openings; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is restrained—only two metaphors, both serviceable. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding (“she realized then that…”) could be carved. No loops, typos, or tense slips; paragraph cuts pass. Closure line is soft but not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence swells and contracts with dive vs. dance beats; no template repeats. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“shadows danced upon crumbling walls” sets tone then yields to concrete gesture. One mixed metaphor: “breadcrumb in a forest” amid oceanic lab jars slightly. Zero paraphrase loops, clean grammar, precise paragraph cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, mostly propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the chamber glowed… the crystals seemed…”) slightly thins density. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. A few filter verbs (“he felt”) dull peak immediacy, but not enough to obscure closure image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene’s hush.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, with purposeful enjambment across commas; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are spare and consistent (moonlight threads, fluid thoughts). Information density is high—each sentence advances ritual stage or sensory grounding. Closure line avoids overwrite, letting mirrored stars reweight the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; openings avoid monotony. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; information density is high (“inheritance of a life she hadn’t expected” packs emotional + situational data). One mixed metaphor—“rooftops whispered secrets to the stars”—is minor. Meteor imagery recurs with pattern-teaching payoff at closure. Clean grammar; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm breathes with the twilight pacing; metaphor density is high yet coherent. Occasional template cadence (“She saw…, she understood…”) and filler phrases (“seemed to”) slightly dull propulsion, but no loops scar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong information density—many sentences do two jobs (image + interior). Figurative control is good except one mixed metaphor (“threads of truth from the fabric of time”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Passive constructions are rare and justified. Typos absent. The single metaphor muddle keeps it just below 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative layering is dense in every sentence (“serpentine nexus,” “fires of desire,” “liquid starlight”) without pattern-teaching or restraint; triggers −0.4. Mixed metaphors—“weave” vs. “fires” vs. “song”—co-exist without clash resolution. Strong info density when action present, but several near-paraphrase loops (“echoed, transformed,” “altered, transformed”). Closure line avoids muddle, saving mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lyric cadence occasionally loops (“whispers of the lost,” “whispered names”) – light template. Metaphors coherent but plentiful; density high yet propulsive. No scaffold; paragraph cuts tight. Final line earns its uplift. Minor synonym churn on “ice/shrine/candles” cluster.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm is deliberate and unafraid of lushness; clauses accumulate like net-loops, mirroring theme. No scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Mixed metaphors are few and minor (“moon paths as invisible rivers”). One purple patch—“secrets of persistence and beauty in the dark”—is tolerated at this length. Opening and closing lines both anchor and re-charge; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density: one sentence often does three jobs—“the diamond’s flaw was a seal, containing something ancient and dangerous” = object state + stakes + mythic rule. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in orchard calm, staccato during chant. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line (“the wasteland had its secrets, but so did she”) re-ups the charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Most sentences advance image or knowledge; density is high. Metaphors are coherent (portico as bridge, storm as birth). Paraphrase loops minimal—only mild echo of “new dawn.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. A few elevated phrases (“lyrically prophetic,” “gritty whimsy”) feel prompt-sourced but don’t muddle causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are avoided. One paraphrase loop (“emptier, yet fuller”) is purposeful resonance, not artifact. Figurative language clusters only after the box plays, when heightened texture is earned. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) fits the poet narrator without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet lyric; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; ice cracks are rendered with onomatopoeic brevity. One paraphrase loop (“the key’s power… the key’s energy”) grazes the climax but does not obscure causality; still disallowing 9+ globally under artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and scene-driven—“air crackled” is brief, accurate to cold electricity. Information density high: each sentence advances horizon mapping, lunar tracking, or visitor influx. One mixed metaphor cluster (“sculpt patience from impatience… unyoke chaos”) is abstract but brief; no clarity loss at closure. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, consistent past tense.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences open variedly, no paraphrase loops detected. Sensory nouns are concrete (“rust and damp earth”) and verbs strong (“echoed,” “flickered,” “trace”). One metaphor (“shadows seemed to reverberate”) is near-cliché but rescued by the sonic echo motif that pays off at the end. No artifacts touch closure; rhythm accelerates naturally into the final dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic variety: long lyrical sentence → clipped final clause mimics heart tick. Information density high; single sentence often layers scent, metaphor, and moral calculus. One mixed metaphor: “calm…like a cloak” beside “storm was coming,” but coherent under situational lens. Zero loops; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose stays lean: every sentence advances discovery or texture; no filler, no loops. Figurative control tight—metaphors are spare (“void left by the missing crew”) and don’t clot under pressure. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; final line offers resonant callback. One micro-register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for the POV, but it’s brief and isolated, so −0.2, still within high band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are lean, with high noun specificity; no synonym loops. Two stock strings—“shifting ice floes,” “pulse of the world”—slip into template cadence. Figurative muddle absent; closure image remains luminous and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence varies: opening spondees (“jagged shards”) give way to flowing aurora passage. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors are coherent (ice teeth → whisper lullaby) and paid off. High density: lace, breath, thermos, aurora compressed into final parasol lift without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, readable, with varied sentence length and minimal scaffold. Two paraphrase loops (“mismatch… mismatched,” “understanding… understand”) appear but outside climax, so −0.2 only. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Density is adequate; some sentences could compress further, yet momentum never stalls. Closure image remains clear and unaffected by minor repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace—long sentences for pavilion hush, staccato for dagger reach. Figurative layer is dense (“silken walls rippled with faint hum”) yet consistent; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold pair: “the whispers might vanish forever” is restated almost verbatim late; mild loop, not closure-touching. Opening and closing images (mask adjust / footprints erased) frame effectively. High density, minor loop keeps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are lean, syntactically varied, and information-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold stems detected. Metaphors (“vines whisper secrets”) stay physically consistent. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image-earned lift. A single clause—“since then, she had dedicated her life”—tilts toward summary but is compressed and strategic, not momentum-dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, loop-free; sentences vary in length and stem. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph—four consecutive sensory phrases beginning with “The” creates template cadence—but pattern is broken before critical beats. Metaphors (crystal as mausoleum, map, seed) cohere and do not contradict. No artifacts touch the closure line, satisfying the 7.0 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is sparse and scene-specific—“damp veil that seemed to mute even the memory of sound” is fresh yet concrete. One mixed metaphor slip: “prism for the future” momentarily fractures light where memory is liquid, but the image recovers. No paraphrase loops; each chalk or driftwood mention adds new physical or symbolic state. Register stays within Elias’s mystic-philosophical lexicon. High density: every paragraph advances map, memory, or atmosphere. Artifact-free enough for 8.8+ elsewhere; final third clean.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphor density is high but patterned—clock = cosmos, leaf = surrender—taught by 25 % and paid off in the final slowed spin. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive clauses. One mixed metaphor risk—“luminous ache” is abstract, but it is immediately re-grounded in chest sensation, so clarity recovers. Closure line breathes cleanly: “observatory...hummed with a new kind of constancy.”

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, readable, free of loops or near-duplicates; metaphors are simple and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“hymning the mundane,” “conceptual repricing”) feels authorial rather than Elara’s. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. No artifacts touch the closure beat; the final line is crisp and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; copper-plate etching sentences layer tactile detail without clogging. One paraphrase loop (“the key…its purpose”) and a stock metaphor (“vortex”) keep it sub-8.8. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often moves plot, image, and interiority. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with beats. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges tooth-star motif.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer sentences during memory, staccato polish-strokes during work. One scaffold “the glass… the glass…” repetition is minor; no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Information density strong—each sentence layers weight, color, breath—but occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “zephyr bloom”) nudges register slightly above Lira’s experiential lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “moss clung…like nature reclaiming its throne” delivers metaphor without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image that recharges pendant and garden motifs. Occasional adjective pairs (“soft and emerald,” “raw, vulnerable”) are purposeful, not modifiers in lieu of stronger nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, no template churn. Some lyrical compression—“swirling hush of a feral nexus”—risks purple but stays within POV lexicon. Information density high: one sentence can anchor setting, object, and emotional stakes. Zero loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pulses; paragraph breaks coincide with light beats. Sentences vary in length; no scaffold clutter. Metaphors (“light like liquid gold”) recur without fresh re-angle, creating mild synonym churn. No artifact obscures closure; final sentence lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data (“frost-kissed ground,” “ghostly moon”) while advancing the ritual action. Figurative language is frequent but patterned—starlight, breath, pulse—so repetition reads as incantatory rather than sloppy. No scaffold loops or synonym churn detected; clauses are cleanly sequenced, participles controlled. Occasional elevated diction (“safekept,” “subarctic”) fits the mythic register and is consistent, so no register drift penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence length modulates with tension; only two scaffold loops (“reflected...reflection” in adjacent lines) briefly dull momentum but are outside the closure beat. Metaphors are coherent—echo as snowflake, marble breathing—anchored in physical logic. High density: each sentence advances image, angle, or internal state. No typo or pronoun drift. Final line resolves by image, satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene—paragraph lengths swell and contract like lungs. Metaphors stay coherent (fractal, spider-web, calcite) and payoff at closure. One scaffold near “boundary-lessly trapped” repeats concept-label twice; minor loop but does not touch final image. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—steam “distorting” light works—kept below saturation threshold. One strained metaphor: “time itself had crystallized” edges toward abstraction, but occurs mid-scene, not at closure, so artifact penalty minor. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Minor scaffold: “fractured stillness” repeated within 60 words; one paraphrase loop on “lagoon’s currents” / “currents that danced.” No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Information density is high—“the object was peculiar, its gears half-buried, its lens cracked but still gleaming” does triple duty.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lean, scaffold-free; no synonym loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—“maze of intentions” is the prompt phrase, reused judiciously. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. One paraphrase risk: “remnants of old dreams could spark new ones” echoes prior sentence but adds temporal sweep, tolerated. Information density high; each sentence advances setting or motive.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive: varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops, high information density (“the clocks ticked in unison, their rhythm a soothing constant, but Elara’s heart beat to a different tempo”). Metaphors are coherent—blank clock as void—without mixed logic. Minor tick of overwriting: “excruciatingly gentle” is used twice in 700 words; the reprise feels decorative rather than reweighted, triggering −0.3. Final line earns its resonance through prior pattern, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: one sentence often paints scent, light, and metaphor simultaneously—“surface a mirror reflecting the faint glow of the stars above.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; scaffold is minimal. Metaphors stay coherent (whispering brass, canal as past-present seam). Opening line anchors stakes; final line crystallizes recharged possibility. A few intensifiers (“seemed to whisper,” “faint hum”) could be trimmed, but none clutter closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentences shorten under knot-focus without syntactic monoculture. Strong verbs—“gleamed,” “lapped,” “coax”—replace modifiers. No paraphrase loops; fulgurite and spiral return with reweighted meaning. One mixed metaphor—“veins of a leaf” for lightning glass—slight blemish, not closure-touching; density high, momentum steady.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image ("tiny obituaries") that recharges prior motifs. One tiny register lift—"geometry of healing"—but it is the traveler's private idiom, justified by her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and largely free of loops; sentence openings vary, momentum steady. Occasional elevated phrasing—“time seemed to have forgotten its purpose,” “bitterly sweet reminder”—edges toward template cadence but does not stall the beat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold artifacts obscure causality. A few adjectival stacks (“otherworldly glow,” “mechanical decay”) could be pruned for density, but they do not penetrate the closure line.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, high density (every sentence advances image or pressure). Occasional elevated register (“conceptual cost,” “unyielding compassion”) nudges out of POV lexicon; two paraphrase loops (“black sand… black sand,” “lagoon… lagoon edge”) dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is largely clean: strong verbs (“shuddered,” “spilling”), no scaffold loops, metaphors stay coherent. Two adjacent sentences open with “The box” (minor template cadence) but the repetition is purposeful, teaching the object’s agency. No overwriting in the fountain-eruption beat. A single mixed metaphor—“memories like liquid starlight”—is vivid enough to pass. Meets the 9+ gate for zero artifact in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences layer image with emotional charge. Occasional soft overlays (“quiet sigh of falling petals” twice in 100 words) create micro-loop paraphrase, but artifacts never touch the closure beat or obscure causality. Metaphors stay coherent within the nebula logic; no register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; no template runs or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“thundering calm,” “fleeting symphony”—and avoids purple overload. Two minor scaffolding echoes: “across the butterfly migration” and “across the glass panes” create spatial preposition repetition; not severe. Sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) with clean grammar and tense stability. Closure sentence is crisp, image-driven, no filter clutter. In 9+ range except for the noted echo.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is textured and generally propulsive, but figurative layering is dense (“tidal obsidian ridge,” “whispered secrets,” “searing reverie”) enough to flirt with purple in a 750-word space. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. One paraphrase loop: “incremental absolution” is both inscription and narrated label—minor. Strong information density; sentences often perform dual duty (e.g., brass bob as both clock heart and cosmic metaphor). Final line lands cleanly. To reach 8.5+ would need either higher variety in sentence rhythm or sparser metaphor under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Metaphors are coherent—“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”—and propel mood without purple excess. Minor scaffold in repeated “a scent he had grown to love”-type anaphora and two instances of simultaneous participle openers; no artifact touches the closing line, so Non-closure Cap is −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; mixed metaphors are avoided. One scaffold pair: “He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it” restates the same motion. Occasional filter (“seemed to shift”) is voice-motivated to preserve wonder. Rhythm modulates successfully; no artifact obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe with scene tempo. High information density in opening 120 words anchors who-where-when without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“the song seemed to know… seemed to cloak itself”) costs −0.2. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands with image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (“ash…dancing”) stay coherent and localized. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to whisper,” “felt a strange connection”) but it clears before the final beat, leaving closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm breathes—long sentence for sewer mood, staccato for surface urgency. Mixed metaphors avoided. One scaffold loop: “a time before chaos… chaos of his surroundings” paraphrases within 3 lines (−0.2). No artifact touches closure. Momentum stays intact; opening and closing lines carry imagistic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary; openers avoid template. No loops or synonym churn. Figurative language kept spare; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned,” “traveled stillness”) feels slightly writerly rather than lived-in, but does not obscure causality. Closure line clean, image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths swell and contract with night→dawn arc. Sentences do dual duty—“the greenhouse seemed to hum” advances both atmosphere and plant magic. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold trace: “she knew… she knew…” repeated opening in adjacent lines (−0.2). Closure image is uncluttered, letting “glowing orbs” land clean.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies: short beat “With a deep breath, she descended,” against longer, image-rich clauses. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances position, temperature, or knowledge. Metaphors are sparse, coherent: tower as “silent sentinel” fits ruined-world tone. Opening and final lines are ear-tested strong; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sensory detail is selective. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent, though “streetlights daydream” and “hushed blaze” flirt with mixed registers; they do not obscure causality. Closure line breathes effectively, earning its pause.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere. One scaffold echo: “time seemed to stand still” appears in open and close; otherwise no loops. Metaphors (“tapestry of whispers”) are consistent with Liora’s voice. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. Grammar clean; no simultaneity errors. Read-aloud rhythm is varied, paragraph cuts purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence advances chalk/roll/stair logic; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physical—dice as relics, staircase as arteries—avoiding purple. “Clatter echoing in vast emptiness” is crisp, not overwritten. Final third is clean: no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences avoid template cadence. Information dense: one line delivers humidity, light angle, and emotional tilt. Minor paraphrase loop “lost language … forgotten” repeated conceptually −0.2. Metaphors consistent (moonlight/ink). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. No typos.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm holds; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—one sentence can set scene, body, and emotional charge (“Elara sat…emerald glow mingling with lantern light”). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) stays within character-scholar lexicon. Closure line is clean, resonant, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but metaphor density peaks in the lighthouse paragraph (“broken tooth,” “tomb,” “whispering secrets”) without pattern payoff, causing minor coherence drag. One paraphrase loop: “latent radiance” is repeated twice in adjacent clauses. Otherwise, strong verbs (“traced,” “shuddered,” “erupted”) and sensory specificity carry momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, metaphor-rich yet uncluttered; no mixed metaphors or template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers sound, sight, motion. A few adjectival swells (“breathtaking pattern”) flirt with overwrite but occur post-climax and do not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Density is high: single sentences handle atmosphere, world fact, and interior pulse (“The air vibrated, and for a moment, the gate seemed to shimmer”). No mixed metaphors; “sunwashed dread” is a precise tonal oxymoron. Peak beat in the golden chamber avoids purple prose; obsidian image is sharp and brief. Final line cadence echoes opening phrase, giving a quiet circular snap.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, varied, and largely free of loops; only minor scaffold (“it was here… it was a reminder…”) repeats introductory stubs. Metaphors are coherent, though occasionally ornamental (“mind worked like a loom”). No artifact touches the closure beat. Density is good; momentum stalls only during the summary insight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are dense yet propulsive—each carries at least two jobs (e.g., “His heart, usually stoically sensitive … now pounded with uncommon urgency” delivers characterization, emotion, and tempo). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare and tied to physical stakes (“dreams were said to drown”). Italics on the note are purposeful, not decoration. Clean copy: no pronoun drift, tense stable, paragraph cuts tight. The final line “the dreams … would rise again” risks a touch of uplift syrup, but the image is earned by the prior mosaic glow.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence variety carries the dive. Information density high—each sentence advances setting or motive. One paraphrase loop: “stillness” echoed three times in 200 words; subtract 0.2. Metaphors are coherent (library as “old friend”), no mixed vehicles. No scaffold, no synonym churn. Closure beat is clean; no artifact touches the final stamp glow.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is mostly lean; information density high (“vessels for dream recording, capturing fragments…”). Metaphors occasionally layer (“mist…lover’s whisper,” “luminous torment”) but stay within POV lexicon. No scaffold loops; only mild paraphrase near basilica entry. One mixed image—“light shifted, casting his shadow in sharp relief”—shadows don’t form inside translucent walls; −0.3, but does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and mostly concise; occasional scaffold phrases (“a scent that clung… like a second skin,” “a spark of unfiltered awakening”) recycle metaphoric shells. No mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality; clarity stays intact. Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts pass. Minor figurative shorthand keeps it from 9-band but does not derail closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear, efficient, low-density; sentences do one job. Figurative language is sparse, safe. Minor scaffold: “the air smelled of dust and old parchment” + “dim light filtered” = adjacent sensory checklist. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final image is strong but unvaried diction. Clean copy; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional lyrical layering (“sieved hush that muffled even the crash”) is purposeful, but three near-adjacent “as if” similes in the driftwood paragraph soften momentum; no loops or scaffold obscure causality, and the final sinking hand lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates with storm gusts; sentences shorten when lantern flickers. Metaphors (“mist clung…like forgotten secrets”) are singular, not stacked. One paraphrase loop noted above; no synonym churn. Information density is high—each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. Copy is clean; only the occasional adjective “storm-worn windblown” feels slightly purple but fits voice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Varied sentence length supports the meditative cadence; only two paraphrase loops (“weight of failure…fractured heart”) and one template run (“She…she…she…”) appear, not in closure. Metaphors are coherent: compass needle “mocking” stays within POV. Clean grammar, no mixed vehicles. Density is high: each paragraph advances situation or stance. Minor scaffold keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is natural; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—galaxy, labyrinth, shadow—each image returns reweighted, avoiding decorative overload. No scaffold loops; “glow” recurs with shifting semantic charge. Minor filter verbs (“he felt”) appear but are voice-motivated, not clustered. Closure image is sharp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is fluid but prone to ornamental layering (“molten gold,” “cosmic intimacy”) that advances little new information. Metaphors don’t clash but stack predictably; no syntactic drumbeat, yet openings favor participial or adjective-fronted clauses that soften propulsion. Occasional scaffold: “She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply the scent of rare spices that swirled around her” compresses two actions into one breath without adding pressure. Copy is clean; paragraph cuts would not remove causal knowledge but would delete decorative repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is generally fluid; sentences open with variety. Figurative language is dense—sometimes every sentence carries a metaphor—yet the pattern is established early and supports the lyric mode, so −0.3 rather than full penalty. Occasional mixed metaphors (“beauty tightening like a noose” beside “sand through clenched fists”) create minor muddle, but not at closure. A few filter verbs (“she realized,” “she saw”) could be cut for immediacy; scaffolding is light.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (“gravity of sorrow”) recur but are coherent, not stacked. High density: each sentence advances image or motive. Minor scaffold: “faint, otherworldly resonance” is filler-adjective pairing; does not tangle causality. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, almost no scaffold; each sentence advances image or interior tilt. Figurative language is spare—metaphors of dance, bridge, texture—yet mixed only once ("timeless dance" beside "texture of transformation"), a hairline slip that keeps the score sub-8. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verb choice throughout. Final line is crisp, image-driven, fulfilling the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; momentum remains steady. Information density is solid—each paragraph advances puzzle or tension. Minor scaffold: “the sundial was more than a timekeeper; it was a cipher” is immediate paraphrase, −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift; closing image “bronze quill holder glinting in the light” is crisp and recharges the mentor motif.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence carries dual load: “colors shifting from pale green to deep violet” paints sky and signals approaching climax. Metaphors are coherent—aurora as fabric, eels as moving stitches—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each rock placement adds new numerical or color data. Final line “he would chase them until the tides run dry” provides cadence without overwriting, cleanly capping propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythm variety and selective metaphor keep momentum; only occasional modifier stacks (“weathered desk, their fingers tracing”) flirt with overwriting. No template cadence or synonym loops. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; closing line couples thunderclap to narrative seal, earning flourish. Minor scaffold: repeated “storm outside seemed to…” construction three times—each serves personification pattern but slightly thins late beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence layers image or emotional charge. Figurative language is patterned (“blooming resistance,” “luminous fracture”) and repaid at closure. One paraphrase loop—“library glowed with a newfound vitality” echoes prior “glow”—but too minor to penalize. Line breaks breathe with emotional cadence; no scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and opening. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One tiny scaffold (“she watched intently, searching”) barely registers. Clean grammar, precise tense, and vivid noun choice throughout. Closure line breathes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is pleasant but template-driven: stock metaphor strings (“intertwined like vines on a trellis,” “dissolve like ink in water”) appear in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff, triggering −0.4 under density rule. Phrase loops recur (“the island’s memory,” “collective memory,” “cultural memory”) and a scaffold sentence repeats the dream/seed structure twice with near-identical wording. Sentence openings vary moderately; paragraphing follows soft scene breaks rather than tension pivots. Grammar is clean, but purple tint and synonym churn dull immediacy.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“knelt,” “coalesced,” “fluttered”) and precise nouns (“brackish water,” “skeletal frame”). However, minor overwriting occurs: “preprocess reality” and “quiet architect” verge on abstract label-speak, and the phrase “gradual, humbling process of transformation” in the final line leans toward summary. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold, but one instance of near-redundancy (“decay of the space mirrored the decay she studied”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery (“glass that seemed to capture moonlight,” “frost had formed intricate patterns”), but occasional overwriting dilutes momentum: “scorched testament to secrets she had never intended to uncover” repeats “scorched” and “secrets” redundantly. Sentence openings vary well, though two adjacent lines use “She...” without propulsion gain. Final paragraph’s “belonging to the canyon, to her art, and to the truth” risks triadic cliché, slightly dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fingers traced the edges of a tuning fork case, its polished wood worn smooth from years of handling” conveys history, emotion, and object). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in the phrase “impenetrable silence had fallen, as if the universe had held its breath”—a near-cliché metaphor—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph cuts. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “pulsing faintly under his touch” and “hum with a quiet urgency” verge on redundant lyricism. One paraphrase-loop risk in the final paragraph (“permanent address… bring us home”) slightly softens closure impact. No scaffold or template cadence; information density remains high, though two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the lens’s glow without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with high information density—e.g., “dwindling like the embers of a dying fire” merges image, emotion, and stakes. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “amplified quiet” and “gently persistent,” which verge on label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“The food was only the beginning… true resilience came from unity”) lean toward conceptual redundancy, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere (viaduct as ribcage, sparks as heartbeat). Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“shimmered under the fading sun,” “sky bled into hues”) borders on density overload, though it serves atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances mood, character, or plot. Final line (“steps lighter, heart fuller”) risks slight abstraction but earns it through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure to match mood shifts. High information density: “vines curled into arches that seemed to breathe” conveys setting, atmosphere, and animism in one clause. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One overwriting risk: “cascade of images and sensations” leans generic, but it’s swiftly anchored by concrete ancestral faces. Closure beat (“discovered herself”) is clean, though slightly abstract—saved by preceding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“pried open,” “burst into the open air”) and concrete nouns. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “creaked like an old man’s bones,” “fluttering like ghosts,” “dancer dodging unseen blades” cluster in early paragraphs without payoff, risking purple prose. Minor paraphrase-loop in “their chains dragging behind them like shadows” followed by “chains dragging behind like anchors.” Final line (“grace staggering in its quiet triumph”) inverts cliché but feels slightly ornamental rather than causally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “silence shaped like a scream,” “battered marvel of human experience.” Figurative language is consistent (synesthetic metaphors never contradict), and sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold in “she had come here for a purpose… to find the sound” slightly flattens momentum, but no loops or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—shorter clauses, tactile verbs—sharpens closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong sentence variation and high information density. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “casting her in a glow of luminous disbelief” repeats “luminous disbelief” from earlier dialogue, creating a faint echo-loop. Also, “golden-hour portrait thief” and “emerald station” lean on aesthetic labels without grounding action. These don’t obscure causality but prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“trace,” “bend,” “dissolution”) and varied sentence lengths. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“safe zones for inquiry, spaces where questions could be asked”) and metaphors border on over-articulated (“thawing heart” paired with literal melting ice). Final paragraph’s “whisper its approval” edges into personification cliché. No scaffold loops, but minor register drift in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong opening (“rusted library under the stars”) and closing symmetry. However, adjacent lines repeat concepts: “truth she had uncovered” / “everything felt like a lie”; “trembling certainty” appears twice. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors—though “whispers coalesced into a single, clear voice” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence multitasking (e.g., “The fort itself seemed to listen” advances atmosphere, character, and plot). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ambered hush” → “marbled hush”) and payoff-earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Closure beat (“last star flickered and vanished”) is uncluttered, with rhythm mirroring thematic finality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“gleaming,” “unraveling,” “dissolved”) and purposeful rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“thoughts unraveling like threads in a tapestry”) borders on mixed metaphor but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“resonant hush,” “ambiguously clear light”) creating minor density in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “crystals whispered” appears three times with diminishing returns. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final lines land cleanly, recharging motifs without redundancy. One mixed metaphor (“fingers tracing… as if they held the key”) slightly muddles embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“time seemed to bend like the paths”) are coherent and recurring. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs shift length to mirror contemplation vs. action. One paraphrase loop: “cracks not as flaws but as markers of survival” echoes earlier phrasing without added pressure. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught (glow → rainbows → whisper), so no overwriting penalty. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and generally precise, with strong verbs (“loomed,” “surged,” “flickered”) and varied sentence structure. Information density is high: most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. However, figurative language occasionally overloads (“metallic scar,” “icy warmth,” “mechanically warm” in close proximity), creating slight register drift. One paraphrase loop appears: “her motivation burned brighter than her fear… fueled by years of being dismissed” repeats the same idea across adjacent sentences. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, ending on a resonant, active image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with high information density—e.g., “water damage creating images that seemed almost deliberate” conveys mystery, decay, and agency in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “hush of unstruck chords” appears twice, and phrases like “wordless conversation” verge on repetitive abstraction. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony, but figurative language occasionally prioritizes mood over propulsion (e.g., “threshold, a liminal space” feels explanatory). Closure image remains clear despite slight lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “metal frame etched with memories of countless storms” establishes setting, history, and tone). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“swaying” certainties ↔ swaying petals) and payoff-integrated. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “auroral sorrow” recurs as label more than embodied sensation, and “jagged shard” leans toward stock metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize emotional state rather than dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and atmospheric, with strong verbs (“jutting,” “clutched,” “groaned”) and varied sentence structure. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“shadows danced like spectral figures”). One minor loop: “whispers that seemed to echo her father’s frantic calls” followed by “whispers coalesced into a chorus… each one pleading…” slightly paraphrases. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold clutter; momentum remains taut. Final lines avoid overwriting, landing cleanly on “peace.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“crawled,” “embracing,” “unravel”) and selective sensory detail create momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (vines silencing whispers, roots as hands). One near-miss: “quiet chaos” slightly contradicts “crumbling peace,” but the tension serves theme. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes the river’s song.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and sensory specificity (“velvet pouch,” “cracked but functional telescope”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “whispers of ancient stories,” “dreaming roots,” “ordinary magic” cluster without grounding. The phrase “softly adaptive” appears twice as label rather than demonstrated behavior. No fatal loops, but “hush” and “hum” border on sonic overuse; final image slightly deflated by generic “stories yet to be told.”

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but suffers from minor overwriting: “bronze quiet of forgotten eras,” “collect the whispers of the past,” “probe deeper”—phrases verge on ornamental abstraction. A paraphrase loop appears in the climax: “her mind probing… her heart beating… the displaced axis began to shift” restates the same progression without new pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, the ritual’s execution lacks concrete physicality, dulling the closure beat. Otherwise, line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structure and purposeful diction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“mysterious… cryptic… enigmatic”), stacked modifiers (“accidentally prophetic fortunes… whispering secrets… guiding them”), and therapy-speak (“latent power,” “self-discovery”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion in peak beats—e.g., “maestro conducting an orchestra” followed by “grand orchestration.” Final paragraph reads as thematic summary, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and musical, but suffers minor overwriting: “muffled clarity,” “unraveled stillness,” and “resonant” recur with near-synonym churn. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without sufficient grounding, risking opacity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but mixed metaphors (“paint with black… in the air itself,” “shimmering like a void given form”) slightly blur physical logic. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, though figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting (“hum with an ancient energy,” “laughter unraveling like threads of silk”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are sharp and functional. Minor register drift appears in phrases like “resonant reconfiguration” (not in text but echoed in “mirrored horizon” abstraction), yet clarity remains intact. The final paragraph’s cascade of clauses risks muddling propulsion, but the closing line (“the soul of the one who dared to dream it”) redeems momentum with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrites: “darkening brightness—hope mingled with dread” uses abstract duality where concrete sensation would deepen impact. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter, though “gravity defier” and “procedural generation” feel like imposed labels rather than organic descriptors. Sentence rhythm propels momentum well, especially in the fractal transition (“the viaduct was no longer the same…”). Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly, but the phrase “retrace the steps of her own existence, through procedural generation” suffers from clunky tech-register intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, though occasional overwriting appears (“alien, their melodies distorted yet hauntingly beautiful”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional beats. Minor scaffold in “hours turned to days” summary, but overall high information density. Final tear image lands cleanly—warmth contrasting “mirrored hush”—with no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally precise and atmospheric, with strong verbs (“uncapped,” “slip through,” “shrouded”). However, repetitive phrasing appears: “message tube” recurs without variation, and “solitude” is stated thrice. The phrase “credibly curious” reads as label-speak rather than embodied trait. Final paragraph contains slight overwriting (“purpose fulfilled,” “life would never be the same”) that softens the punch of an otherwise taut climax.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise (“neon lights clashed with whispers of forgotten eras”), with strong verbs and minimal filter words. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs shift rhythm to match scene beats. Minor overwriting in the greenhouse description (“petals preserved in jars like relics”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops or artifacts mar closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every image serves character or theme (e.g., rope “uncoiling like a serpent” ties past trauma to present choice). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“texture of time,” “ethically playful”) risks abstraction but is grounded by concrete action. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“Elias stepped,” “The rope slipped,” “He reached out”). Closure line (“poem to write—and rewrite, endlessly”) perfectly echoes opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush yet controlled, with high information density—e.g., “fractured yet glinting,” “chronic hush... swallow sound.” Sentence rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beat: “tapestry of sound that seemed to awaken the dormant world” leans slightly purple. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (silence as canvas, bowl as brush). Final line lands cleanly without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose avoids loops/scaffolds: each sentence advances atmosphere (“molten gold” light), character (“gloved fingers”), or plot (petal dissolution). Information density is high—e.g., “static electricity... tingled across her skin” establishes method and tension simultaneously. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of feeling” metaphor (slightly strained), but peak beats remain clear. Sentence openings vary (“As a counterfeit...”, “Her client...”, “When she opened...”), supporting momentum without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“echo lingering as the audience filed out into the cool night” borders on redundant). No major loops or scaffold, but “cycles of compassion” is stated outright—a minor thematic echo. Final paragraph’s “lighter now, as if its purpose had been fulfilled” risks sentimentality but lands due to earned context. High information density overall; every sentence serves atmosphere, character, or motif.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density—e.g., “calloused from years of shaping fragile reeds” conveys history, craft, and fragility in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/refraction/web motifs) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in the opening (“shimmering crater, where light refracted through prism-like trees”) risks purple prose, but rhythm recovers quickly. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“towers leaned closer, their rooftops forming a labyrinth she navigated instinctively”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the narrative. Minor overwriting in the climax (“water so still it seemed to hold eternity”) borders on purple but serves tone. No loops or scaffold—every image advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure beat remains clear despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density: “roots twisting deep,” “iris swirling with colors that seemed to shift” do double duty (setting + mood). Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in peak moments (“mathematics of emotion… not about control but about harmony”) edges toward abstraction but avoids therapy-speak. No loops or scaffold; closure line (“promise of understanding”) recharges the orchard motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, with high information density (“aisles whispering secrets only the walls could hear”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “pulsed with a quiet energy, as though it wanted to be found” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“metallic veins humming”) slightly strains physical logic. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“they had uncovered more than…”), though closure image remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “plants whispering encouragement in a language only she could hear” risks sentimentality; “pulse with a life of its own” flirts with cliché. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. However, minor paraphrase loops appear (“chaos she could predict, nurture, and understand” / “study plant behaviors… about transformation”), and “circuitously sincere” feels inserted rather than earned in action. Closure image remains clear despite these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “tidal islands rose like ancient sentinels,” “bioluminescent algae, a reminder of the world’s fragile rebirth.” Figurative language is selective, not stacked; metaphors cohere (island as archive, brooch as key). Minor scaffold in “her mind buzzing with questions” slightly dulls immediacy, but closure beat (“brush hovering… began to paint”) avoids overwriting. Sentence variety supports momentum—long sensory sweeps yield to short, decisive actions.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: “overlapping shadows, each layer revealing a new fragment” borders on stacked modifiers. One paraphrase loop: “steadily unpredictable” appears twice with minimal variation. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, peak beats lean on abstract nouns (“destiny,” “possibility,” “essence”) over concrete verbs, slightly dulling propulsion. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; clarity remains intact despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “timbers splintered, ropes frayed” compresses devastation economically. Figurative language is purposeful (“harbor whispered its secrets”) without purple overload. Minor scaffold in “her mind racing with possibilities” slightly flattens immediacy, but peak beats avoid therapy-speak. Sentence variety supports rhythm—participles for motion (“brushing away debris”), fragments for tension (“A note, pure and resonant”). Closure image (“wreckage less a reminder… more a promise”) avoids abstraction through tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs (“curling,” “dissolved,” “align”) and controlled rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“mist curling around her ankles like a living thing” followed by “air thick with anticipation”), risking figurative density. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or plot. Closure image (“stars above seemed to align”) is clear, though slightly conventional.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraphing. Information density is high—each line advances setting, character, or mystery. Minor overwriting in the climax (“swirling constellations that seemed to dance in unison”) edges toward purple prose. No loops or scaffolding, but one paraphrase near the end (“bridge between worlds… tool to sculpt space”) slightly dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“fractured,” “shudder,” “unleashed”) and varied sentence structures. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: phrases like “shadows danced like ancient whispers” and “watercolors on wet paper” border on ornamental, especially clustered in early exposition. One paraphrase loop appears: “endless, aching void” followed shortly by “eternal emptiness.” These minor artifacts don’t obscure causality but prevent 9+ eligibility per line-level standards, slightly dulling the climax’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “deathly vitality,” “liquefying rigid thinking” avoid purple excess. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes during reflection, tenses during threat. One slight redundancy: “fragile equation, one she wasn’t sure could ever be solved” borders on paraphrase. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; closure beat is clean. High information density—each image serves atmosphere, character, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“gilded-leaf stationer,” “battered notepad,” “fluorescent lamp flickered”), and sentences vary rhythmically. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “her quill barely keeping pace with the flood of images and sounds” leans toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one register drift (“incandescent restraint”) slightly jars with otherwise tactile diction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong sentence variation and purposeful rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears (“symphony of lives intertwined” leans purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but minor redundancy exists (“fragments of overheard stories—a dockworker’s lament, a smuggler’s boast, a child’s lullaby” echoes earlier listing logic). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “glitch in the system” introduces a jarring tech metaphor amid organic imagery. Final lines avoid artifact contamination, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “strings taut but silent” conveys state, history, and metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching emotional beats. Minor overwriting in peak moments (“whisper of closing pages brushing against her skin”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every image serves atmosphere or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong verbs (“cobbled,” “etched,” “ignited”) and varied syntax. No scaffold loops or repetitive stems; information density is high. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“testament to resilience,” “beacon of possibility”) slightly dilutes closure’s grit. Final lines risk sentimentality but retain enough specificity (“stars twinkled above the Cerulean Sea”) to avoid abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented: “shadows danced with the silvery glow” risks purple prose. Minor redundancy in “bittersweet reminder of the impermanence of all things” after earlier “fleeting nature” line. Sentence openings vary well; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines echo “fading into the distance” / “silent guardian,” slightly dulling closure. High information density overall.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful—figurative language serves texture (“mist curled around her,” “anchor of its own”). However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “soul woven into every piece,” “rhythm of the event,” and “testament to her skill” verge on declarative summary. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“her mind decoding feedback into direction… silent dialogue”) border on paraphrase. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “promise of renewal” risks thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“cutting,” “crunching,” “defying”) and specific nouns (“dog-eared pages,” “frosted floorboards”) avoid modifiers. Minor overwriting in “worrying tranquility” and “singular convergence” edges toward abstraction, but payoff justifies it. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density—e.g., “wild hush” conveys tone, atmosphere, and thematic tension in two words. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“orchestra of ghosts,” “symphony” of footsteps)—slightly repetitive metaphor—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains clear. One paraphrase near “balance restored” slightly dulls momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without pattern payoff (“ethereal glow,” “pulsing glow,” “soft, ethereal glow”). Paraphrase loops abound—e.g., “uns n arl the secrets” repeated as action, concept, and metaphor. Mixed modifiers (“lonesome splendor,” “gathered hush”) verge on neologistic vagueness. Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“wonder,” “peace,” “beauty”) that dull closure impact. Momentum stalls in reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“weathered,” “spiraling,” “thread”) and sensory specificity (“salt and storm,” “colder, heavier air”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “lattice sustained impossibilities—its intricate weave held secrets, whispers…” edges into stacked abstraction. One paraphrase loop: “refuge and curse” / “silence he’d chased” / “wanted to be heard” slightly repeats the silence/truth conflict. No syntactic monotony; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally overwrites: phrases like “lovingly venomous connection that both soothed and tormented her” verge on label-speak, and “endless night that clung to the glass walls like a second skin” risks mixed metaphor. Still, information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme—and the final paragraph’s propulsion is strong. Minor redundancy in describing the bead’s power slightly dulls momentum mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought—phrases like “hauntingly optimistic aura” and “orchid solace” verge on abstract lyricism without grounding. Minor paraphrase loops: “carve a path from ruin to reverence” recurs without deepening. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, “sewing stories into canyon walls” relies on extended metaphor that risks obscurity. Final paragraph tightens rhythm well, but mid-story cadence sometimes stalls under descriptive weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“snaked,” “thrilled,” “weaving”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is purposeful (roots as “veins through forgotten history”) without overwriting. Minor scaffold in “each shard of pottery or fragment of bone she uncovered” slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with summary (“she had come here broken…”), yet closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence-level propulsion and varied rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “masterpiece of cryptic communication” edges toward label-speak, and “time capsule waiting to be opened” risks cliché. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the end paraphrase the theme (“remind it of what it once was” / “meaning to be found”), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “amber leaves,” “velvet cushion,” “piercing green” eyes serve atmosphere without overwriting. Minor density issue: “adjacent possibilities” appears three times in close proximity with slight synonym churn. Final paragraph’s “vast… but so were the stories” risks abstraction, though “one stitch at a time” grounds it. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Strong verbs (“twisted,” “hummed,” “pulsing”) and specific nouns (“rainspout shard,” “liquid silver”) avoid fluff. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats—“fierce tenderness” appears twice, and “singing spirits” repeats without variation. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase “unsent letters” edges toward label-reliance. Final paragraph’s rhythm slightly flattens, though closure image remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting mars peak beats: “fragile peace amidst the ruins of war” and “lotus-hearted ache” verge on ornamental abstraction. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts feel intentional. However, two adjacent lines (“She unknotted the first phrase… It was a plea…”) border on paraphrase-loop. No scaffold or template cadence, but figurative density in high-pressure moments slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong verbs (“shrouded,” “crumbling,” “swirl”) and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. One paraphrase loop: “lost joy return, not just in her art, but in her soul” echoes earlier phrasing unnecessarily. No figurative muddle, but “pensive mirth” feels slightly forced as a tonal label.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “metallic flowers hummed with vibrations of distant echoes” establishes texture without overwriting. Sentence openings vary (“In the heart…”, “Her fingers…”, “As she worked…”), and paragraph cuts heighten rhythm. Minor redundancy in “crumbling wall” / “faded lines” / “muted by time” slightly dilutes opening density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language serves accumulation, not ornament. Final line’s “sound waves were no longer just vibrations but stories” crystallizes theme without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“hummed,” “flicker,” “converging”) and rhythmic shifts. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “the air thickening with tension” + “shadows shifted unnaturally” + “hum grew louder” stacks atmospheric cues without advancing causality. One paraphrase-loop: “spark of defiance” (opening) and “spark of defiance burning brighter” (closing) risks redundancy, though the reprise is thematically justified.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors like “reef-shadow joy” and “blossom armistice” risk abstraction without full embodiment. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraphs 4–5 (“her lullabies were not just for herself… a gift to turn their pain”; “songs, once private, now felt universal”). Figurative language dominates high-pressure beats without sufficient grounding in concrete action—e.g., the climactic “shift” is described as warmth and understanding, not sensory or behavioral change. Still, rhythm varies well, and key lines (“stars on her postcard seemed to wink”) land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density: “glass-orchard caretaker” conveys role and world in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (opal hues → starlight names → moonlight shards) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting appears in “bittersweet and aching” (redundant) and “gently systematic grace” (adverb pile), but no loops or scaffold mar momentum. Final paragraph’s chime “in approval” slightly anthropomorphizes, but rhythm and closure propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrites: “symphonies of truth, melodies woven from the purest intentions” risks purple prose, though payoff justifies it. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in structure and propulsion. Minor redundancy in “tangled threads of a promise” / “weave them together,” but not adjacent. Closure beat (“they were”) is concise and resonant. Information density high—each line advances character, atmosphere, or theme without padding.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“uncoiled,” “synchronizing,” “foreclose”) and concrete nouns (“brass links,” “crumbling amphitheater”). However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “encrypted compassion” is repeated as near-label, and “slyly heartfelt” borders on abstract descriptor. One paraphrase loop: “conflicting values… tension between them” → “harmonize their conflicting values.” Final paragraph’s “weight of his achievement” slightly dilutes the sharper physicality of earlier lines.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“blooming and withering parts of her soul”) and varied rhythm, though occasional figurative stacking (“symphony of blooming and withering, of loss and rediscovery”) edges toward overwriting. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Information density is high—e.g., “messages she wrote on slips of paper torn from the margins of old books” conveys occupation, method, and thematic weight in one clause. Final paragraph’s lyricism is earned by prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“fractured hush,” “necessary distances,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing). One paraphrase loop: “thresholds felt sacred, while others were mere passages” echoes later as “sacred thresholds weren’t about the places they led to…”—redundant conceptually. No scaffold or template cadence, but “featherly” (used twice) edges toward label-only trait. Closure beat remains clear despite slight density.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density (“stars trapped in a jar,” “shadowseam wonder”). Sentence rhythms breathe with scene needs—flowing during dance, staccato at alarms. Minor overwriting in paragraph 3: “softly ingenious precision” repeats the earlier descriptor, creating a slight loop. No scaffold or causality-obscuring artifacts; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves propulsion (“sand slipping through her fingers,” “cheerful gloom”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of a memory she could almost grasp but not quite hold” echoes later as “dissolved before she could fully grasp it.” Not severe, but prevents 9+. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“celestial glow,” “calculated wilderness”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density peaks during the climax without full payoff—e.g., “shadow that seemed to pulse with life” risks abstraction. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final line (“ready to happen again”) echoes the opening effectively. One register drift: “philosopher of chance” feels academic for the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shadows stretched like whispers,” “petals unfurling like pages.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (gaps, light, anchoring) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“obsidian grace,” “dewy petals”) borders on purple but serves atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or mood. Final line’s “fledge” echoes earlier yearning with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—e.g., “ripples spread outward, creating intricate rings that shimmered” conveys action, beauty, and thematic weight in one clause. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the scene’s pace, and metaphors cohere (light/water as knowledge). Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “noctilucent reckonings—moments of clarity that shone like stars,” where explanation slightly dulls the image. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “value in the mundane, the extraordinary in the ordinary.”

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with strong verbs (“caress,” “bargained,” “fractures”) and varied syntax. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “fractures within him” followed by “parts of his soul he had bargained away” restates inner brokenness without added pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; “hard softness” in the final image is resonant, not muddled. One scaffold loop (“the fires he had fought, the lives he had saved, and the pain he had carried”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative density peaks appropriately during pattern-making. Minor overwriting in “serene upheaval of understanding complete”—slightly redundant. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. However, “puzzle out new equations for hope” edges toward abstract phrasing, and “revitalizing her patterns with each wave” repeats concept without added pressure. Still, high information density and propulsion earn strong score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “walls breathing with whispers,” “tendrils curling like fingers” avoid purple excess. Sentences vary in structure and length; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor figurative density in high-pressure moments (e.g., “dreams growing louder, more insistent”) borders on overwriting but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, synonym churn, or register drift; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light, mirrors, heartbeat) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“threading the coded lullabies into the stillness” followed by near-redundant “first note danced…”), but no loops or scaffold dull the climax. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors fading resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer descriptive lines yielding to fragmented urgency during Elara’s breakdown. However, recurring phrases (“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “flawed beauty”) border on motif overuse, and the clipboard’s description repeats without deepening. Minor scaffold appears in summary passages (“hours turned into days”). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “beacon of hope in the darkness” leans stock. Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly despite slight redundancy in “fragile, imperfect, and precious.”

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “boots leaving faint prints in the crystalline surface” conveys setting, movement, fragility). Figurative language is controlled—salt flat as “cracked mirror” recurs meaningfully. One paraphrase loop: “silence of once-thrilling bird songs” and “world that had forgotten it” restate loss unnecessarily. Final paragraph’s “released something greater than herself” risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete rain imagery. No scaffold or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dilutes momentum: “alarming serenity,” “time stretched between sigh and smile,” and “bodily poetic grace” verge on label-heavy abstraction. The phrase “unspoken poem” followed by “stillness as eloquent as her dance” risks paraphrase-looping. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and key lines (“each flake now carrying a fragment of the harvest of echoes”) land with clarity. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats prevents a 9+ score, but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought: “shimmered like embers in the dark,” “sanctuary... without fear of judgment” lean into figurative density without advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“he began to trace... each groove a memory, each knot a lesson” echoes prior description). Final paragraph’s “deeper understanding” edges toward summary, dulling the otherwise strong concrete closure of packing puppets at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“sanctuary of blushing stillness,” “fragment of a forgotten dream”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density runs high in mid-story without pattern-teaching payoff. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and information density is strong—each line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final lines land cleanly, though “stories to be told” slightly veers toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “shimmering veil of the aurora,” “frozen cathedral,” “snowmelt ardor” risk purple prose in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor, which slightly dulls propulsion. Sentence variety is strong, and the final line (“singing once more”) resonates cleanly. One near-redundancy: “fragility of memory without fear of breaking it” echoes “technical gentleness” without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “vines curled like serpents,” “ethereal grit,” “dream within a dream” verge on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loops (“paths that diverged and converged… walkers drawn to destinies”) dilute propulsion. Yet rhythm breathes with the storm, and key lines (“wafer seal glowing softly”) anchor abstraction in concrete detail. Final paragraph tightens effectively, avoiding explanatory bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic patterns (“Kael...”, “The tile...”, “He...”) and overuse of abstract modifiers (“profound”, “insatiable”, “enduring”). Key beats are summarized (“began to uncloak the tile’s mysteries”) rather than dramatized, dulling momentum. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, phrases like “encrypted devotion” and “dusky harmony” recur without evolving meaning, creating lyrical loops. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, but earlier scaffolding (“once... now...”) slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is competent but over-reliant on stock phrases (“palpable resentment,” “brow furrowing,” “glimmer of hope”) and therapy-speak labels. Figurative density is uneven—high-pressure beats like Kael’s memory recall use abstract telling (“weaving through the labyrinth of his memories”) instead of concrete sensation. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“broken things can still hold value” / “fractured but not beyond repair”). Sentence openings vary adequately, but passive constructions (“was rendered useless”) dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “frost crunching beneath her boots” conveys sound, time, and movement). Figurative language is purposeful—“glass mountains” recurs to modulate tone—and avoids muddle. Sentence variety supports rhythm: short clauses during breathwork, longer cadences in reflection. No loops, scaffold, or purple prose; every image serves escalation or closure. Final line crystallizes the bridge metaphor without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“chaotic beauty, branches heavy with fruit, leaves rustling with secrets”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports momentum. One paraphrase loop: “repair not just objects but the fractures in people’s lives” echoed later as “mending wasn’t about restoring what was lost.” No fatal artifacts, but slight density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally over-figured (“captured starlight,” “whispering silence”). No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines summarize the same realization about inheritance. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. The phrase “simply complicated” appears as label without embodiment, triggering minor therapy-speak penalty. Overall momentum holds, but closure beat slightly dulled by abstract diction.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, and figurative language (“corridors twisting like a living entity”) enhances atmosphere. However, minor overwriting occurs: “symphony of secrets that only she could hear” repeats the “unheard symphony” motif redundantly. No crippling loops, but phrases like “carefully resourceful” feel label-like rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “haunting melody of what once was” and “trapped freedom that once thrived here” verge on redundant abstraction. Minor paraphrase-loop in describing the ship’s decay across adjacent sentences. However, sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final line (“flaws and all”) delivers clean closure. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats, preserving immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and atmospheric density. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “her mind a tapestry of connections forming with every braid” leans into metaphor without grounding. The phrase “warmly methodical” is stated but never shown through contrasting behavior. No fatal loops, but slight redundancy in describing the rope-seal alignment dulls momentum just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “storm of light and sound that left the world trembling,” “melody of silence, a lullaby for the storm” verge on stacked modifiers. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density occasionally edges toward purple (“song now a gentle lullaby”). Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “beacon of silence in a world of noise” slightly dilutes the earlier specificity. Still, momentum and clarity hold.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“mend what time has shattered,” “pulse with life”). Figurative language is restrained but potent (“shard of hush,” “thistle-blown hope”). Minor overwriting appears in climax (“light casting intricate patterns,” “song of the stars”)—slightly purple but not muddled. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. One near-paraphrase: “rekindled more than a prism; she had rekindled hope” risks redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. Sentences often multitask—e.g., “The crystal stones beneath her feet whispered faintly, their voices a chorus of forgotten stories” conveys setting, sound, and theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“a city in flames, a child’s laughter, a promise whispered in the dark”)—a triplet list verging on decorative. No loops or scaffold, but one slight register lift (“sculpt identity from experience”) edges toward abstraction. Otherwise, line-level craft is elite.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (light/dark motifs) but occasionally overwrought (“laughter like a floodgate opening”). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, mixed metaphors (“gravity of hopelessness,” “filter the darkness”) strain coherence slightly in peak beats, dulling closure’s edge just enough to cap below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “tidal-pool chronicler,” “texture of time,” and “jade cicada’s hum synchronized with her heartbeat” do triple duty (character, theme, atmosphere). Minor overwriting in “celestial tapestry” and “ever-unfolding tapestry” risks slight redundancy, but pattern feels intentional. Sentence openings vary (“The ancient grotto...”, “A tidal-pool chronicler...”, “As she turned...”), avoiding monotony. Closure line (“stars above seemed to wink in approval”) lands cleanly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“cradle,” “sprout,” “shrink”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “symphony of nothingness” and “flavors of silence” lean into mixed metaphor territory. No paraphrase loops, but “gilded hush” repeats without deepening. Final paragraph avoids summary, closing on resonant image—but “set her free” edges toward generic resolution after otherwise precise language.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence variety and purposeful figurative language (“fading note hanging like a question mark”). Minor overwriting appears in descriptors like “vaulting hush” and “fluidly logical,” which verge on ornamental abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “storm glass vial” repeats without variation. Final paragraph’s “soft, inner light” risks slight sentimentality but lands due to prior object integration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful: “crystalline ground,” “living mosaic” serve atmosphere without stalling momentum. One paraphrase loop: “faint, otherworldly light” / “faint light” within three lines. Figurative density peaks appropriately at closure (“stars shifted into a single, blinding point”). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but “heart quickened” borders on cliché. Overall high information density with clear propulsion, though two adjacent “pulse” references slightly blur specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“tendrils of shadow snaking,” “chorus of resilience”) and strong verbs (“pressing,” “erupted,” “recede”). Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs shift length to mirror tension. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “suffocating presence that threatened to erase everything” borders on redundant intensification. No loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor (“burn bridges” literalized via scar-severing) slightly muddles causality without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“coalescing,” “resonated”) and purposeful figurative language. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences advance atmosphere, plot, and character. One minor density issue: “ethereal light a stark contrast to the darkness she had once navigated” edges toward abstract summary. Closure beat (“guardian of the quantum promise”) risks slight abstraction but is anchored by the gleaming bolt. Read-aloud rhythm flows naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“whispered secrets of generations long gone,” “vibrations that seemed to resonate… within her very soul”). A paraphrase loop appears in the bridge paragraph: “She knew this place—it was the bridge…” followed by restating its significance. Figurative density is high in peak beats without sufficient payoff, slightly dulling clarity. Still, rhythm varies well, and key images (crank handle, journal) carry propulsion. Closure image is clean, avoiding scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “bioluminescent vines pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat” conveys setting, emotion, and causality. Figurative language is pattern-taught (vines as “whispered secrets” early, “instructions” late) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “shivering bliss creep into his veins” slightly softens immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“weaver of possibility”) recharges motifs cleanly. Sentence variety supports propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“shelves sagging under the weight of lives reduced to manila folders”). Figurative language is purposeful, not excessive; metaphors align (“forgotten promises,” “thread… worth unfurling”). Minor scaffold in “she had always been tactfully hopeful” leans abstract but is quickly grounded in action. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is often lush but over-ornamented: “auric lagoon shimmered,” “heavens had spilled their secrets,” “dormant technology filled the air” stack metaphors without grounding. Minor loops exist (“plans unraveling faster than she could mend them” → “she adapted” lacks intermediate struggle). Final paragraph’s “ghost in their machine” clashes tonally. Sentence variety is good, but figurative density in high-pressure beats dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “vested hush,” “eerie nostalgia,” and “quietly vivid palette” risk abstraction. Minor redundancy in describing mist (three iterations) and moss (four). No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks, but figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without sufficient grounding (“melody reached the heart… where prophecy had taken root”). Read-aloud rhythm varies well, yet some phrases (“whisper of a melody lingering”) verge on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is evocative with strong information density—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “pulse with an otherworldly energy,” “warmth spread through her hand, as if the speck were alive” lean on figurative convention. No paraphrase loops, but one template cadence (“She learned that… This aligned with…”) slightly dulls momentum in the exposition block.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously (“swirling leaves danced in the drafts, as if urging him forward”). Figurative language is restrained and coherent—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“frustrated yet intrigued… decided to improvise”) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold or artifact obscures closure. Final line’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, with strong verbs (“gaping,” “tugging,” “flared”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “luminous regret that had clung... now flared brighter” edges toward label-speak. No loops or scaffold, but “fragments of a greater whole” slightly echoes earlier “fragment of something larger”—not harmful, but near-redundancy. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters just slightly with summary (“search was far from over”).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “luminous ache,” “distorted notes of a misaligned harp,” and “spectral confessions” approach purple prose in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“her heart steady despite the weight… Her motivation was clear”) and “fragility of life, depth of love, power of release” risks abstract triad syndrome. Final note lingers effectively, but figurative density slightly dulls propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but controlled, with high information-per-line efficiency. Minor overwriting occurs in mid-story (“symphony of ultraviolet penance” borders on mixed metaphor), and one paraphrase loop (“pain into purpose” / “pain, there is purpose”) slightly dulls momentum. Sentence variety sustains rhythm, and the final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyric weight. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks impair immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “symphony of whispers,” “storm she could barely remember,” “shadows that danced like ghosts” all advance atmosphere and character. Sentence variety supports momentum—short clauses during descent, flowing syntax in reflection. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“testament to the resilience of intuition”) leans abstract. No loops or scaffold, but “elusively tangible” repeats without deepening, costing full marks. Final line’s cadence perfectly echoes opening, rewarding attention.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fluorescent lights flickered... plunging the space into dim, eerie calm” establishes mood, setting, and supernatural cue). Minor overwriting in “gravitational force drawing him toward the ceiling”—slightly physics-adjacent but forgivable as metaphor. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and precise. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors closure: steady, quiet, forward-moving like the repaired clock.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves accumulation (“sea of clouds,” “whispers of books”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “pulsed faintly with an otherworldly light”—“faintly” weakens specificity—but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“The story was just beginning”) risks cliché but earns it by echoing her craft and the library’s aliveness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “gilded spires and obsidian canals” establishes setting and theme in six words. Figurative language is controlled (“burnished sorrow,” “torrents of luminescence”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “cities reshaping themselves, people altering their histories” slightly dilutes the vision’s impact, but sentence variety and paragraph rhythm propel momentum. Final line (“a testament to the enduring power of reimagining”) risks abstraction but is earned by prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“coax,” “snap,” “cascade”) and purposeful figurative language. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances plot or theme. One slight overwriting: “waterfall of stars” borders on cliché but is redeemed by immediate physical consequence (gears smoothing). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong sensory verbs (“crunching,” “shimmered,” “rippling”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“otherworldly light,” “silent sentinels”)—figurative density slightly blurs immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “place where explanations fail” recurs with minimal variation. Final paragraph’s rain metaphor lands cleanly, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: “storm-tossed archway loomed ahead” + “sky churned with dark clouds” risks stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loop: “layered meanings” appears three times without progression. Figurative density spikes in the climax (“chamber erupted in light”) but remains coherent. Strong verbs (“clutched,” “pulsed,” “etched”) anchor specificity, yet “profound sense of purpose” drifts into label-speak. Final line’s momentum falters slightly with redundant “real transformation was just beginning.”

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong sensory variation and syntactic diversity. Yet recurring phrases like “dawning hush” and “quietly driven” verge on motif-as-mantra, risking redundancy. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“weathered by time,” “whispered secrets of centuries”), where figurative density slightly dulls propulsion. No fatal loops, but a few adjacent lines restate emotional states (“awe and sorrow,” “beauty persists in the darkest hours”).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density in high-pressure beats (“searing reverie,” “tapestry she was desperate to weave whole”), risking muddle. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“truth buried… secrets… stories demanding to be told”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, but “purple” modifiers occasionally blur immediacy (“solemn civil-rights archivist,” “intricate code that danced”).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, though occasional abstraction (“mind racing,” “felt a pull”) dilutes immediacy. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is controlled—lanterns “bathed” the cove, sea “whispers”—but one high-pressure beat (“She closed her eyes…”) leans slightly tell-y. Closure line (“lanterns continued to glow”) lands cleanly without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steel and glass pierced the clouds” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is selective (“velvet disquiet,” “leaves rustling as if in agreement”) and coherent. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting in “gnarled trees heavy with fruit that seemed to hum” slightly blurs agency, but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-figured (“shimmering, winged being that seemed to embody both chaos and calm” borders on mixed abstraction). No paraphrase loops, but “borrowed time” and “vortex inheritance” verge on label-speak without full embodiment. Final paragraph’s cadence swells effectively, though “one seed, one moment at a time” risks cliché. Otherwise, strong syntactic variety and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“frayed surface,” “pocket of stillness in the midst of the wind’s chaos”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative pulse. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“vibrations that seemed to align with the rhythm of his own pulse”)—a slight figurative redundancy—but doesn’t obscure causality. The final lines are clean, resonant, and free of scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density (“skeletal frame etched against the infinite void”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “trajectories weaving a story of sacrifice and renewal” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “quiet surrender” followed by “flourishing stillness” could be tighter. Final paragraph’s rhythm falters slightly with “forever changed by the primal elegance of her discovery”—a faint echo of the opening that lacks fresh propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs and selective figurative language. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “the air grew heavy with emotion, the weight of unspoken words pressing down like a physical force” uses mixed metaphor (emotion as weight + force) and borders on purple prose. A paraphrase loop occurs in the final paragraph (“preserved the weight… not just for the ghosts but for the land itself”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“trembled,” “crackled,” “wove”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “the silo trembled, and the air crackled with energy” edges toward stacked modifiers, and “timeless bonds that wove through existence” risks abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near the end (“mended time… rediscovered her own connection”) slightly dulls momentum. Final line recovers with concrete tactile imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density: “fingers tracing damp sand” conveys character, setting, and motive. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shimmered like a mirror,” “tapestry of dawns”) risks purple prose, but pattern is taught early and pays off in the kite’s glow. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image remains clear despite figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “mimicked,” “glinted”) and varied sentence openings. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “brazen calm that had defined his life now fueled his final mission” edges toward label-speak. A paraphrase loop occurs in paragraph 3 (“method was simple yet deliberate… gently systematic nature”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm modulates with ascent—breathier at base, tauter near summit. Avoids overwriting despite poetic phrasing; metaphors (“bronze quiet,” “map of homecomings”) cohere. One paraphrase loop: “drawn to a place that felt both sacred and artificial” echoes earlier “nexus for those seeking answers.” Not severe, but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “knees creaking like old hinges,” “petals unfolding like whispers of hope” verge on mixed metaphor. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“narrow vastness” repeated; “submerged concord” echoed without development). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, peak beats lean on poetic abstraction over concrete propulsion, slightly dulling momentum. No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“sun bled into the horizon, casting... amber and ash”). Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer descriptive lines give way to shorter, punchier beats during the factory scene. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“embers catching flame,” “wild hush”). Final line resonates by recharging the leaf’s glow as both image and idea.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. However, mild overwriting appears in peak moments: “temporally stretched cosmos,” “fragility of existence and inevitability of change” verge on stacked abstractions. A paraphrase loop occurs in paragraph 4 (“temporal collapse… pockets of dilation and contraction” then “chaos… randomness”). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but figurative density occasionally blurs immediacy. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with declarative resolution (“role… was not a curse, but a calling”).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. High information density: “cracked chess pieces, their secrets long since spilled” conveys history, failure, and mystery in eight words. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms—“sky’s hues shifting from bruised purples to sickly greens” leans purple. Minor paraphrase loop: “cautious abandon and unyielding determination” echoes later as “cautious abandon” alone. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks, but the chess climax lacks tactile immediacy, relying on summary over granular action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence variation and purposeful rhythm during the walking sequence. Information density is high—each image pulls double duty (chessboard = politics, self, history). Minor overwriting in “luminous absence” and “nomadic penumbra,” which verge on coined abstractions without sufficient grounding. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the end (“She realized… but it had also kept her…”) edge toward paraphrase. Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “mercury-glass seer” conveys fragility, reflectivity, mystique in three words). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “pain of remembering had grown too sharp… yet it was the only way” followed by “pain of remembering was not a curse but a catalyst.” Figurative coherence holds, but “hidden thunder” borders on mixed metaphor when paired with “storm within her.” Final beat avoids overwriting, landing cleanly on “stepped forward.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-figured: “woven hush,” “winnow the soul,” “frayed threads” approach mixed metaphor density in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, but “platinum labyrinth” repeats without evolution. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line (“storm within her”) borders on cliché but is redeemed by prior specificity. Information density is high—most lines multitask—but slight overwriting dilutes propulsion near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. However, figurative density spikes in high-pressure beats (“mist swirled faster… echoes grew louder… shadows of people”) without sufficient variation in sentence structure, creating mild syntactic monotony. The phrase “shattered into pieces, each reflecting a different face of the same wound” is potent, but adjacent lines repeat the fragmentation motif without escalation. Minor scaffold in “she felt… she closed… she began” sequence dulls immediacy briefly, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally strong but exhibits repetitive phrasing (“quilts memories together” appears three times with slight variation) and mixed metaphors (“dire enchantment” clashes with mechanical workshop logic). The phrase “between breaths held underwater” is evocative but never concretely operationalized, reducing its tension payoff. Final paragraph’s “conjures hope” leans abstract after otherwise concrete imagery, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs (“carved by centuries of tides,” “cradled in her hands”) and varied sentence structure. However, figurative density occasionally borders on ornamental (“waves whispered secrets to the stone,” “stalactites hung like chandeliers”) without advancing pressure. A faint paraphrase loop appears in the reflection on the promise (“timeless… outlast… fleeting existence”). Final paragraph’s “tapestry of stories woven together by the sea and time” risks abstraction but lands due to prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“bathed,” “weaving,” “clutched”) and controlled figurative density. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with action (shorter during descent). Minor scaffold in “screaming tenderness” risks abstraction but is grounded by physical ache. No loops or synonym churn; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final image (“moves mountains without a sound”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “hum,” “waxed”) and minimal filter language. Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs breathe with scene needs. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “raw solace she found in the process kept her going” uses two abstractions where one concrete image would suffice. No loops or scaffold, but “geography of loss” borders on label-speak—saved only by its recurrence as active metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “occlude,” “exhale”) and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“fractured grace,” “orchard held its breath”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Slight overwriting in “swirling with colors that seemed to shift”—“seemed” weakens immediacy—but overall high density and propulsion. Final line resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and precise (“weathered planks glistening faintly,” “mist clung to him like a second skin”), with strong verbs and sensory economy. Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of a story that wasn’t his own” followed by “fragments of a life lived in fragments” risks redundancy. No figurative muddle, though “opal dock” verges on decorative without functional payoff beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs (“swelling,” “lapped,” “crystallized”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“sanctuary of faded parchment and crumbling atlases”) borders on decorative. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “lingering promise” appears twice with slight redundancy. Final third avoids artifacts; closure image (“maps... alive with possibility”) lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“crunched,” “coiled,” “cascaded”) and varied syntax. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “lacy menace,” “bleeding starlight,” “molten silver” cluster in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, risking purple prose. Minor paraphrase loop: “ember grotto’s warmth now palpable” followed by “air growing warmer.” Final paragraph’s “light remained in her heart” borders on sentimental abstraction. Still, momentum holds, and closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing triple duty (atmosphere, character, theme), but occasionally overwrites: “fragment of a forgotten star,” “spiral of endless possibility” verge on purple. No paraphrase loops, but stacked modifiers (“calloused yet delicate,” “burnt orange and deep violet”) recur without variation. Final paragraph’s “twilight wrapping like a promise” risks cliché. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key beats avoid filter verbs—cost is implied through image, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “feral nostalgia, a longing for moments she couldn’t remember but felt deeply”). Figurative language is purposeful: “wild horses refusing to be tamed” sets up the later “soar.” One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “fragmented, like a shattered mirror, each piece reflecting a different version” slightly redundantly echoes earlier fragmentation. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, closing with resonant economy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “fogged with the breath of ancient mechanisms” merges setting and metaphor economically. Sentence openings vary (“In the hush…”, “Her hands…”, “Yet, it was not…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “joy and pain intertwined” edges toward abstraction, but the next line grounds it in “quiet strength.” No loops or scaffold—every image serves accumulation. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“bathed in soft morning light…”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “saturated hush,” “elastic time,” and “obsidian surface glinting faintly” each advance atmosphere, character, and theme. Sentence openings vary naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“crystallizing like frost on a winter morning”)—a slight density excess—but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp despite lyrical flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “whispered secrets of centuries past,” “laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves” verge on stock lyricism. Minor paraphrase-loop in describing the bottle’s hum and the archive’s whisper. However, sentence variety, strong verbs (“channel,” “fraying,” “mend”), and rhythmic control mostly serve momentum. The final paragraph’s cadence beautifully echoes the opening, though “ethereal grit” as a phrase feels abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, concept, and motion simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively, though mid-story leans on figurative density (“hum with secrets,” “shimmered with possibility”) without sufficient grounding in action. Minor scaffold: “journeying inward while walking out” is repeated without deepening mechanics. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, landing cleanly on “keeper of the resounding hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient: “fjord quiet… pressed against your ears” exemplifies sensory specificity. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs breathe with scene needs. However, slight overwriting appears in “eminent peculiar” and “relentless march of time”—stock modifiers that could be sharper. No loops or scaffold, but “razor edges” repeats without evolving its figurative logic, missing a chance for deeper textual integration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but largely purposeful: bioluminescence, ripples, and wildfire metaphors cohere under a consistent textural logic. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“quiet wildfire burning in her heart” borders on mixed metaphor). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “boundaries are not walls but thresholds” / “boundaries are not meant to confine, but to connect.” Not severe, but prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“Inside, the air…”, “Among the rows…”, “She was Elara…”), and paragraph lengths create rhythmic breath. Minor overwriting in “scent that clung to the shelves like a forgotten memory”—simile borders on decorative—but overall figurative language serves the Accumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; final lines resonate without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“cultivated estrangement” crystallizes motivation in three words). Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“loneliness gnawed… like the damp air eating away at the tunnel walls”). Minor overwriting in the second paragraph (“melodically haunted” borders on label-speak), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line lands with perfect propulsion: simple syntax, charged object, resonant verb (“begin”).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from overwriting: figurative density in high-pressure beats (“haunted euphoria,” “petals unfolding in silent celebration”) approaches purple prose. Repetitive constructions (“gently thorough” used twice verbatim) and paraphrase loops (“preserve the weight… ensure stories… never be lost” / “honor their story… not forgotten”) dull momentum. Final paragraph avoids major artifacts, but mid-story reflection contains scaffolded abstractions that summarize rather than dramatize. Sentence variety is strong, yet rhythm occasionally stalls under stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, though a few adjacent descriptions verge on paraphrase (“decaying grandeur… mirror her inner state” / “ivy… reclaiming its own”). Figurative language is mostly coherent, but “polite anarchy” in the finale feels conceptually vague. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“each word a whisper that painted the world in her mind”) and avoids redundancy. Figurative language is coherent (melody as breadcrumb, silence as liquid) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “quiet blaze of determination” and “constellations paused” edges toward purple, but clarity holds. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence—no scaffolding or loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“crumpled,” “thresh,” “unbend”) and controlled figurative language. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sea of light and shadow, surrounded by fragments of time”) slightly blurs causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “confidently uncertain” borders on label-speak. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, echoing opening motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrites: “shadow woven from starlight,” “tapestry of emotion” verge on stock lyricism. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs 2–3 (“hands moved fluidly… fingers danced again”). Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high—each image serves theme or character. However, the phrase “map the silence” appears twice with little variation, and “voiceless”/“voice” recurs without deepening, triggering a −0.3 scaffold penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly concise, with strong verbs (“traced,” “wiped,” “unrolled”) and selective imagery. However, adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“Their motivation never wavered, fueled by the volcanic tenderness... They knew the promise was not just a personal vow...”) and figurative density increases near the climax without payoff (“ethereal glow,” “light that would illuminate the past”). Final paragraph leans toward summary over dramatization, softening closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—e.g., “auroral sorrow that clung to her was not just hers” conveys emotion, backstory, and theme in one image. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax, risking density overload; phrases like “frayed tapestry” and “liquid memory” border on stock lyricism. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the final paragraph’s “weaver of dreams” edges toward thematic echo. Read-aloud rhythm remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “air smelled of salt and rust,” “shadows stretching unnaturally long.” Sentences vary in length and structure, matching storm’s cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. One slight overwriting: “intricate symbols that seemed to shimmer” borders on generic, but the tactile detail of the warm coin compensates. Final paragraph’s rhythm resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“stillwater tension,” “fragmented bursts” of light), varied syntax, and strong verbs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. However, “spiralingly calm” is a coined adverb that strains diction—it recurs without grounding, verging on label-speak. Also, “weave” used abstractly (“weave with shutters”) lacks tactile specificity until later. These minor artifacts prevent 8.5+, but momentum and clarity remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting plagues key passages: stacked modifiers (“cobalt library nestled in a perpetual mist,” “ethereal beauty a stark contrast”) and repetitive conceptual phrasing (“plant forests of second thoughts,” “nurture seeds of doubt”) create paraphrase loops. Figurative density overwhelms propulsion—most sentences prioritize mood over advancement. The final paragraph suffers from summary (“he knew that he had planted…”) rather than concrete image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: “ocean’s breath whispered secrets to the sand” establishes lyric tone without purple excess. Sentences vary in structure and length; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (dream → decision → island). One slight redundancy: “guarded heart” appears as concept then literalized presence, bordering on paraphrase-loop. Figurative language is coherent (water/light barrier, whale song as call)—no mixed metaphors. Closure image (“rowed back… combative tenderness”) recharges opening grace.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“slicing,” “whittled,” “pulsed”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “remade hush” (repeated twice) and slight abstraction in “morally ambiguous figure” dilute immediacy. No loops or scaffold; closure image (“heart… pulse faintly”) avoids purple prose while resonating.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but pattern-taught: “humming quartz” motif escalates coherently. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“dissolving boundaries” appears twice verbatim; “tremor of certainty” repeats). Overwriting flares in climax: “shards of ice floated upward... each fragment reflecting cobalt light” borders on stacked modifiers. No syntactic monotony, but filter verbs (“felt,” “knew”) cluster in final paragraph, slightly dulling immediacy. Closure image remains clear despite minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “shards of colored glass glinted like captured rainbows” establishes visual irony immediately. Figurative language is pattern-taught (music as “living thing,” brushstrokes with “life”) and pays off in the concertina’s crescendo. Minor overwriting in “symphony of grays and whites” leans purple but doesn’t obscure causality. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final image (“depth that spoke of the courtyard’s soul”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong information density (“golden shadows stretched,” “symphony of whispers”). Minor overwriting appears in mid-section (“powerfully gentle and unwavering” borders on stacked modifiers). No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “propel it forward by questioning assumptions about progress and loss” and later “propel the world forward—not by abandoning the past…” slightly echo. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“air hummed with the weight of centuries”), though occasional overwriting appears (“curtains of intention swayed gently in an unseen breeze” risks abstraction). Sentence variety sustains momentum, but the phrase “teach withering to bloom again” repeats verbatim, slightly dulling resonance. No loops or scaffold; closure line (“illumination was possible”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise (“rain tapped like distant Morse code,” “ink swirling like storm clouds”). Occasional overwriting: “labyrinth of numbers and timestamps” borders on abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but “steadily curious” appears twice—minor redundancy. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with summary (“testament to their collaboration”), though dawn imagery redeems closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “atoms of nostalgia were alive within its metallic lattice” risks figurative muddle. No paraphrase loops, but stacked modifiers (“crumbling stone tablets,” “fragmented light,” “tantalizingly out of reach”) create slight density drag in mid-section. Final paragraph tightens effectively. Sentence variety and rhythm support momentum, though one or two near-purple passages dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “surge of luminous regret, a sorrow so profound it seemed to echo through her very soul” risks therapy-speak abstraction. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences restate the shadow’s nature (grainy footage → dismissed as glitch). Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (“layers peeling like old paint,” “stars wove light”), risking purple saturation in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“reconstruct… reconstructing”; “fragile convictions… fragility”). Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, yet phrases like “enduring power of hope” flirt with abstraction. Information density is high, but some lines tell rather than embody.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line yield (“stone walls whispering secrets only the morning light could decipher”). Minor overwriting in the climax (“sand from both began to swirl, merging into a single, unbroken stream”) edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but “displaced miracle” appears twice without concrete grounding, creating slight conceptual muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm beautifully echoes the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative with strong information density (“each step a whisper of history”), though occasional figurative stacking (“hushed thunder,” “forgotten lyrics searching for a tune”) slightly dilutes clarity in peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “unused love was stored here… but it didn’t have to stay that way” echoes prior lines. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional cadence. Final line lands cleanly without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shards of glass that glimmered like captured starlight” does atmosphere, character, and motif work. Minor overwriting in “symphony of light and sound that seemed to pulse through her veins”—mixed sensory metaphor slightly muddles. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly with abstract phrasing (“shadowed rapture of the stars”), dulling closure’s tactile charge. Otherwise, high information density and clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though some lines lean on abstraction (“fragile oasis,” “otherworldly light”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “vortex of light,” “floating orbs of light,” “glowing embers” risk figurative density without payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “sparks of the unlit corners” borders on label-speak. Final paragraph propels cleanly, with the ticking clock providing rhythmic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously (“metallic vines twisted and gears bloomed like flowers”). Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in climax (“roar” of insight) edges toward abstraction, but closure image remains concrete. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; every paragraph alters emotional charge or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“twilight draped the veiled ridgeway in a gauzy light, the kind that blurred edges and softened truths”) and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (mist as cloak, ridgeway as serpent). Minor overwriting in “hills were cloaked in mist, their peaks hidden, their slopes whispering stories”—slightly redundant. Closure beat remains artifact-free and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One overwriting risk: “seraphically mundane presence” and “unpardonable silence” lean decorative, but are redeemed by later recontextualization. Closure beat (“frostbitten hope”) lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“dust danced,” “throne is a shadow”) without overwriting. Minor flaw: slight cadence repetition in middle section (“Days turned into nights… each marked by…”), but not enough to dull momentum. Final lines achieve resonant propulsion without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“reclaim,” “smudged,” “drumming”) and varied sentence structure. Minor overwriting appears in “Periodically eternal,” which introduces a poetic abstraction not grounded in Elara’s lexicon. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “delayed revelation” in the prompt feels slightly forced when mirrored in-text without deeper integration. Final paragraph maintains momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “rusted hulks of forgotten ships loomed like silent giants” establishes tone and scale efficiently. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, minimal filter verbs. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create rhythm. One slight overwriting: “vibrant, living constellations that pulsed with energy” borders on redundant. Otherwise, high information density, clear propulsion, and zero loops. Closure image is sharp, not dulled by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient—“fabric brittle from years of neglect,” “golden hues shifting like molten lava.” Figurative language is patterned (steam as ghosts, roots as army) without overload. Minor flaw: slight paraphrase loop in “decode it, each character a piece of a puzzle she hadn’t known existed” followed by “script spoke of cycles…”—redundant revelation. Final paragraph’s “beacon in her hands” verges on cliché, dulling closure’s edge by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“teetered,” “snatched,” “immortalized”) and varied syntax. However, two adjacent sentences summarize emotional states (“She wasn’t healed… but she had found a way”) rather than dramatizing them—a paraphrase loop that softens momentum. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s “symbol of both loss and possibility” edges toward abstraction but is anchored by Zara’s smile.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density (“shards of a shattered mirror,” “groaning under the weight of unread stories”). However, figurative language occasionally overloads peak beats: “luminescent ache” appears three times, risking motif fatigue, and phrases like “threads of her own necessary darkness” border on abstraction. Minor scaffold exists (“she began to redesign… not with brushstrokes but with her mind”) that tells rather than dramatizes. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and the final paragraph propels toward closure without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical (“wind-carved encampment,” “ephemeral patterns that seemed to pulse”). Sentence variety supports rhythm, though a few stacked modifiers (“piercing shade of blue,” “deliberate care”) border on density in calm beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One artifact: “time didn’t slow; it unfolded” risks abstraction but is grounded immediately in sensory detail. Final paragraph’s cadence elegantly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrites: “dizzying quiet settling around her like a shroud” and “library seemed to hold its breath” verge on mixed metaphor. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“silence pressed… dizzying quiet amplifying”; “bravely conflicted… torn between duty and desire”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports tension, but figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy. No fatal artifacts, but not flawlessly lean.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clear and often evocative (“tranquil blaze,” “barren wasteland beyond the glass”). Information density is strong—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “her touch senselessly perceptive,” which leans abstract. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “weave continuity through chaos” repeats as motif and stated mission, slightly blurring show/tell boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “silence had a voice” conveys setting, theme, and character skill). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting appears in “transliterated into something greater,” which edges toward abstraction, but the closure image (“constellations dancing in time with the heartbeat”) recovers clarity. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought (“faint whispers of the wind,” “ghosts of forgotten dreams”). A paraphrase loop appears in the description of her resolve shifting from “solemn playfulness” to “grim determination” then back to “solemnity and playful charm”—redundant emotional labeling dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s figurative density (“testament to her journey”) edges toward abstraction, slightly blurring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“tethered,” “folded,” “hush”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in early description (“labyrinth of glass chambers and humming machines” borders on stacked modifiers), but momentum never stalls. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character or atmosphere. Final line resonates without redundancy, though “stars she tattooed” slightly echoes earlier phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished (“mist clung… like a reluctant lover”; “symphony of laughter and sorrow”), risking figurative density in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. However, mild synonym churn appears (“emergent hush” repeated four times) and one paraphrase loop exists (“not just chaos—it was a plea…” followed by similar phrasing). These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is often evocative (“skeletal silhouette against the shattered sky”), but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“a sky unbroken, a city whole, and people united” / “a sky healing, a city rising, and people embracing”) and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements of “renaming reality”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, “cradle empathy in arms of steel” appears twice with minimal variation, dulling impact. Final paragraph’s “warmth… gentle and unyielding” risks therapy-speak, though not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet purposeful, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, adjacent lines occasionally verge on paraphrase (“whispers grew louder, the shadows deeper”; “shadows softer, and the whispers turned to harmonies”), and the phrase “synesthetically blessed senses” risks label-speak. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative density peaks appropriately in the climax (“swirling tapestry of blues and silvers”). One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “fractally precise edges shimmered” followed by “movements deliberate and fractally precise.” Final paragraph’s “willowglass hope” risks abstraction but is anchored by heartbeat sync with the geode, salvaging closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with high information density in early beats (“hands moved deftly… tracing contours”). However, the climax accumulates figurative language (“danced like memories,” “soft, golden light”) without payoff, slightly dulling impact. Minor paraphrase-loop in describing fossil warmth and pulse across adjacent lines. Final paragraph’s “promise for the future” risks abstraction but doesn’t obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm holds.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“unscramble,” “resonate,” “swelling”) and purposeful imagery. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “quietly inspired,” “raw possibility,” and “charged with the quiet inspiration” verge on label-speak. A paraphrase loop exists in the final paragraph (“truths could be unearthed, and possibilities could bloom”). No scaffold sentences, but slight redundancy in describing the echo’s effect dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and often multi-functional (“mist clung... like a forgotten veil” establishes setting and theme). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “courage felt buried, unused, waiting to be unearthed” followed by “unused courage waits” risks synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; “canvas waiting to be filled” verges on generic. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, but mid-story has slight density bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “time seemed to percolate through the air, slow and deliberate, like a whisper dissolving into mist”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats—“spindrift serenity” and “palimpsest promise” verge on coined abstraction—but cohesion holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “parting before him like a curtain” slightly dilutes the earlier restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density: “hands moved with sharp gentleness,” “chimney smoke... flattened against the horizon.” Figurative language is sparse but precise—no purple prose or mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase occurs in describing the glass’s glow across paragraphs, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Final lines resonate without overwriting, though “living monument to the power of understanding” slightly veers toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (e.g., “quivering hush” conveys sound, tension, and anticipation). Minor overwriting in opening paragraph (“shimmered like a mirror… reflecting the soft glow”) borders on redundant, but not enough to obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s rhythm slows effectively to match the “fading oars,” enhancing closure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “atomically reflective” conveys both texture and function; “brittle light” merges fragility with revelation. Rhythm varies skillfully, though one paraphrase loop appears (“the hum was not just a sound; it was a call, a reminder…”). Figurative language is mostly coherent (clouds as sea, library as living entity), but “voices harmonizing with the stones” slightly strains physics. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with two adjacent clauses starting “She was…”—a minor template cadence. Still, closure image (“beacon of brittle awakenings”) resonates without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory specificity (“scent of rain and renewal,” “marble petals”). Sentence variety supports mood, and paragraphs breathe with intention. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “light pulsed through its veins” mixes biological and mechanical metaphors. The phrase “invisible web that tied the thrush’s nest to the temple…” edges toward explanatory telling. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative density slightly blurs causality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“pored,” “thriving,” “unraveling”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “constellations that seemed to whisper secrets” borders on purple, and “ethereal glow” leans generic. No paraphrase loops, but “cautiously hopeful” → “cautious hope growing into something more solid” risks conceptual redundancy. Final paragraph’s propulsion slows slightly with reflective summary, though not enough to break momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“quivering,” “transfixed,” “receded”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats: “reverberation echoing through her like the lonely church organ” uses mixed metaphor (sound as physical vibration + simile), slightly muddling sensation. A paraphrase loop appears in “spatial mutiny wasn’t just a myth; it was a rebellion…”—restating the same idea across two sentences without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist clung to the jagged edges of stone like a ghostly shroud” establishes tone economically. Sentences vary rhythmically; paragraphs breathe with scene needs. Minor overwriting in “emotional landscapes” and “unifying opposites” risks abstraction, but is grounded quickly in action. No loops or scaffold; every image serves atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat (“mist parted… faint glow of dawn”) avoids purple prose while delivering earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative (“sky itself had wept for its failures”), with strong verbs and specific nouns. Sentence variety supports rhythm—longer for discovery, fragmented for tension. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “spongey dread coiling,” “tornado in reverse” verge on mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the climax slightly blurs physical causality (how exactly does whispering a name shift the world?). Still, propulsion remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with image and metaphor, though occasionally over-compressed (“scaffold wrap flutters” lacks grounding). No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary effectively. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure lines but serves pattern (pixelation → clarity), avoiding purple excess. Final paragraph’s “melody of possibility” borders on thematic echo, yet earns resonance through accumulated specificity. One near-artifact: “wet-plate collodion glass flake” introduces technical term without tactile integration.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong sentence variety and purposeful detail. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like “dusky harmony of shadow and light” and “polished calm,” which verge on abstraction. One paraphrase loop: “crisp, their colors vivid despite their age” followed by “vivid… despite their age” in spirit if not word. Closure beat avoids artifacts, maintaining clarity and momentum through the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraphing. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “map of shared experiences, of burdens carried and lightened by others” followed by “plea for unity, a reminder that no burden was meant to be carried alone” risks conceptual redundancy. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final third remains clear, though “river of light” borders on conventional lyricism. Momentum holds, but minor scaffold in thematic restatement slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “warlike serenity belied the storm within”). Figurative language is purposeful—“swirling orchard pressing like unseen hands”—without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional tempo. One paraphrase loop (“closer to the heart… closer to the truth”) and slight overuse of “glow/glowing” in climax prevent 9+. No scaffold or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: “otherworldly hue,” “anxious elation,” “ethereal glow” verge on stock lyricism. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“shifting faintly… shifting as if alive”; “glow… glowing… glowed”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., climax) slightly dulls propulsion—every sentence sings, but few advance causality, leaning into accumulation over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “tree roots snaked between bones like ancient veins” establishes setting, metaphor, and tone in one stroke. Syntax varies effectively—fragments for tension (“Then, with a smile…”), flowing clauses for reflection. Minor overwriting in “whispers of the dead” and “destinies were bartered” leans slightly purple, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s propulsion (“ready to carve another story…”) earns its lyricism through accumulated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with high information density (“scarred metal desk,” “faint hum of machinery outside”). However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: “The scrap wasn’t just a relic... It represented the noise and the silence...” borders on redundancy. One template cadence appears (“He thought of... And then...”) but doesn’t dominate. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “echo valley longing” verges on mixed metaphor. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops, but minor compression could sharpen the climax. Closure beat remains clear despite these micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shimmered with unseen energies,” “soil she had prepared,” “branches growing toward the sky” all advance character and theme. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the narrative arc. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “her mind piecing together fragments…” followed closely by “reestablish the knowledge that had been lost.” Figurative language is coherent (growth/knowledge metaphor), though “haunted ambitions” borders on label-speak without fuller embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “identities… drifted like seaweed in the currents of existence” merges metaphor and function. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in “smelted and reshaped” (slightly mixed metallurgical/biological register), but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes tone without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally over-embellished (“luminous walls and air heavy with latent radiance,” “mosaic of crystals that refracted light into a thousand colors”). A few adjacent sentences verge on paraphrase (“whispers of abandoned hopes, of dreams left to wither”). Still, rhythm supports momentum, and the final lines land cleanly. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is evocative but occasionally over-figured (“cathedral of decay,” “gleezing tracks”). A paraphrase loop appears in the second paragraph (“map references… fragment of a story… route she had pieced together”), slightly dulling momentum. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final lines land cleanly. However, “raw solace” and “truth-seeking river chronicler” flirt with therapy-speak, triggering minor register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph breaks, high information density (“mist parting like a curtain,” “edges curled as if waiting”). However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats—“cyclically reversed” repeats unnecessarily, and “propagation delays” introduces jargon without prior grounding, creating a minor coherence hiccup. No loops or scaffold, but one mixed register artifact prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled: “roots of the world,” “promise loses its glow” resonate without overload. Minor overwriting in “transparent violin made of ice crystal” (redundant “transparent”/“ice”), and “murmurs of the observatory’s velvet-draped ferns” leans ornamental. Otherwise, rhythm varies, verbs are strong, and closure image (“first stars… blinked”) lands with quiet precision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative density peaks appropriately during the infusion scene without muddle. Minor overwriting in “radiant hush” (used thrice) borders on motif-churning, and “lucidly watchful” reads slightly diagnostic. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“ready to embrace the stillness and all it held”) resonates without redundancy. One near-cliché: “heart pounding” could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“air carried the faintest whisper of a vineyard hush,” “hair that flowed like the wind”). A paraphrase loop appears in the lake vision: “lives she had lived, people she had loved, mistakes she had made” repeats syntactic structure without added pressure. Figurative density peaks in high-stakes beats without muddle, but “vineyard hush” and “umbral grotto” verge on coined abstractions that lack grounding. Final paragraph’s cadence (“clouds drifted below her… smiled”) resolves cleanly with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, concrete verbs, and purposeful imagery. Yet minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“navigate the murkiest moral waters with clarity,” “whisper of truth from the universe”)—figurative density without pattern payoff. One paraphrase loop: “broken, much like the client’s resolve” followed by “crumbling under the weight of doubt.” Closure image remains sharp despite these slips.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: “obsidian polished smooth by centuries,” “starlight casting her shadow long and thin.” Minor overwriting in “carefully woven lies” and “sycamore hush” (slightly precious), but rhythm varies effectively. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence slows appropriately, mirroring earned stasis without slackening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“walls seemed to breathe with the whispers of ages,” “pulse left wandering through the air”), risking density overload in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“weathered by time and resolve” / “weathered resolve deepening”). However, rhythm varies effectively, and final paragraph achieves clean propulsion. No scaffold or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from minor overwriting: “sea of brilliance dimness” muddles metaphor, and “ethereal glow of the lingering luminance” repeats “luminance” redundantly. Sentence openings vary, but a paraphrase loop appears: “to find the sacred in the simple… to prove that true magic wasn’t about efficiency but about heart” restates the same idea. Final paragraph has elevated diction (“extraordinary things… simplest of places”) that verges on thematic echo, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“flame casting a soft glow across the water,” “pages illuminated by ethereal light”), but avoids purple overload. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with pacing. Minor redundancy in “luminous vow that hovered… pulsed” could tighten. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s “spaces between them” risks pseudo-profundity but lands due to earned context. One near-mixed metaphor (“cradle the world in its palm” + “meteor hush”) slightly muddles register.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful figurative language (“stars whispered secrets in static bursts”). However, mild overwriting occurs in peak beats: “deafening and silent” is contradictory, and “wavelength align with purpose” introduces ungrounded tech-poetic diction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “quietly enthusiastic” appears twice without deepening. Final paragraph’s “beacon of hope” slightly dilutes the earlier textured restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and varied, with strong verbs (“crystallizing,” “rippling,” “flared”) and sensory precision. Sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional beats. One paraphrase loop (“echoes of forgotten phrases… their sacrifices echoing”) and slightly overused light/shadow imagery in early paragraphs prevent 9+. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; closure lines (“a reaper once more but transformed”) land cleanly without artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“crystalline arches reflecting hues of pale blue and lavender” leans decorative). Minor paraphrase loop: “fragile devotion” and “brittle devotion” echo without deepening. Final paragraph’s “one dripping rate at a time” slightly simplifies the earlier complexity. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies effectively during repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished, with high information density and strong verbs (“sank,” “prick,” “expunge”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, subtle overwriting appears in peak beats: “pinholes in a dark cloth,” “spun something beautiful from fragments” edge toward figurative density without payoff. No loops or scaffolding, but two adjacent sentences near the climax summarize emotional effect rather than dramatize it (“laughter returned… hearts full”), slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence openings, though occasional overwriting appears (“dew-kissed grass,” “kaleidoscopic waterfall shimmering with renewed vibrancy”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., altar scene) slightly muddles immediacy. The phrase “logic and intuition could indeed dance together” edges toward thematic echo, risking summary. Still, information density is high, and line-level propulsion supports the accumulative design without artifacts harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors like “soundless echo” and “branches twisting like silent guardians” border on abstraction without grounding action. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraphs 4–5 (“recreate movements… each gesture… hands moved”) that restates perseverance without advancing pressure. Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in the climax (“rhythm of light and shadow… testament to perseverance”) risks muddling the decisive turn. Still, rhythm supports mood, and closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs (“hum,” “pulse,” “shatter”) and varied sentence structure. However, peak beats suffer mild overwriting: “grotesque and mesmerizing,” “endless void,” and “vivification of their soul” lean into elevated diction that slightly distances immediacy. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase “complementary opposites” appears twice without deepening, and “emotional numbness” is repeated summarily. Final paragraph’s momentum is clean, though “story had just begun” verges on generic closure phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility just born” establish tone economically. Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs shift length to mirror pacing. One paraphrase loop weakens momentum: “his motivation had always been to create, to solve” followed by near-redundant restatement of purpose. Figurative language is coherent (seed as catalyst, silence as promise), though “orthogonal approaches” feels slightly jarring in diction. No artifacts dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line and strong sentence-level propulsion. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern payoff—e.g., “mechanical whine blending with his melody,” “shadows danced like old memories”—risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops, but slight syntactic repetition in crescendo (“fragments of laughter… pieces of forgotten joy”) dulls momentum. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful figurative language (“eyes like shards of obsidian,” “foggy lucidity”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“weight of the timeframe—through the veil of sleep—pressing upon her”) edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one near-redundancy: “haunting and fleeting” could be tightened. Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly, reinforcing closure without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“jagged end glinted faintly,” “roots spreading through the ruins”). Minor overwriting in climax: “air crackled with power” and “pulsing with energy” verge on stock phrasing. No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Figurative coherence holds—ash, frost, ember motifs interweave without contradiction. Final paragraph’s “blooming with hope” risks sentimentality but is earned by preceding austerity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“skeletal fingers,” “thread of light”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“serenely electric, pulsing faintly as if alive”) edges toward label-heavy description, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final line resonates without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high information density—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“world dissolved into a kaleidoscope…”), but metaphors remain coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One slight redundancy: “resiliently positive spirit unbroken” echoes earlier phrasing, but not enough to trigger artifact penalties. Final line resonates cleanly with the opening starlight image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, though a few adjacent lines verge on paraphrase (“fragile threads that tied… one reality to the next” / “texture of connection”). Figurative language is dense but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“rivers of color,” “living vines”) slightly slows momentum, but closure beat remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“streets wound like veins,” “ships hovered like shards of moonlight”) are coherent and purposeful. Sentence variety supports momentum, though a few high-pressure beats lean on figurative density (“horizon had unfolded once more…”). Minor redundancy in “expand your horizons—not just outward, but inward” echoes earlier phrasing. No loops or scaffold, but the phrase “balancedly curious” feels slightly diagnostic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is evocative with strong rhythm and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“mist clung like a second layer of sorrow”). No paraphrase loops, but “reeling hush” repeats as motif without deepening function. Information density is high—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, “faint echoes of laughter, tears, and silence” leans on stock emotional triads, and the final paragraph’s “quiet but powerful force” risks vague uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“sliced,” “clawing,” “congealed”) and varied sentence structure. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “crashing hush” repeats four times, bordering on motif-as-mantra without evolving function, and “invisible currents that flowed through the undersea cables” uses vague abstraction where concrete sensation would heighten immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density slightly blurs clarity in the phase-transition moment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density: “ink had spread into ephemeral patterns, swirling like galaxies in miniature” advances atmosphere, theme, and plot. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts feel intentional. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of something larger” / “scattered like pieces of a broken mirror” slightly redundant. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “dance like fireflies” verges on generic. Closure line (“found not just answers, but herself”) risks slight sentimentality but is earned by preceding restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth” followed by “precipice,” “luminescent moss,” “copper-veined” in quick succession risks density overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences restate echo-intensification (“fragments of story… memory… plea” then “searching for a pattern”). Final third avoids artifacts, though “flawed diamond” repeats without evolution. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with varied sentence openings and paragraph cuts that serve momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “walls rippled like water,” “scent of ozone,” “hum of unseen life” all advance atmosphere and tension. Sentence variety supports momentum, though occasional overwriting appears (“gravitationally playful” borders on jargon). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every image serves plot or theme. Minor deduction for one near-purple flourish (“cosmic joke” repeated), but closure beat remains clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots began to uproot themselves, twisting and writhing like serpents” merges action and metaphor cleanly. Sentence openings vary (“Her fingers...”, “But today...”, “With trembling hands...”), and paragraphs shift visually with tension. Minor overwriting in “tapestry of tarnished wonder” and slight redundancy in “fragile yet persistent reminder.” No loops or scaffold; closure beat (“final note hanging... like a promise”) avoids artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“darted,” “crackled,” “mended”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: “tempest trapped in amber” and “thunderstorm in a bottle” verge on stacked metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but “flickering” appears three times across static descriptions, slightly dulling momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly, though “delivered a chance” leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: “his hands calloused from years of shaping wood into dreams” conveys history, vocation, and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional overwriting surfaces (“tapestry of forgotten dreams,” “defied their age”), and the phrase “quietly persistent urge” risks label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter, though the climax’s figurative layering slightly dilutes propulsion. Final paragraph’s clarity and cadence redeem minor excesses earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “shelves groaning under the weight of bound ideas” merges setting and theme economically. Sentence variety supports momentum—participles for urgency (“traced… humming”), fragments for awe (“The library trembled”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“kaleidoscope of words and images”) slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“one book at a time”) elegantly echoes opening rhythms without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“In the hush…”, “Elara was not just…”, “The first slivers…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “light danced in swirls and eddies, forming patterns that seemed almost deliberate” risks figurative density without payoff. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase (“bridge between what was and what could be” / “bridge between her world and the one she had lost”).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“starlight whispered ancient truths,” “fragile thread of hope stretched across the hush of cosmic possibility”), risking purple prose in high-pressure beats. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraphs breathe with rhythm. However, minor redundancy appears (“shifting and changing” for the vault’s locks) and one mixed metaphor (“thread of hope stretched across... hush”). These don’t obscure causality but prevent 9+ line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong verbs (“ringed by skeletal remains,” “glowed brighter, as if in approval”). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—but slight overwriting appears in “whispered tales of forgotten voyages” (mixed metaphor: shipwrecks don’t whisper). One paraphrase loop: “decades later” repeats unnecessarily. Final image is crisp, though “beacon” verges on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “steam curling like whispers,” “scars badges of honor” verge on stock phrasing. One paraphrase loop: “haunting and serene” / “silence no longer empty but expectant.” Still, high information density—most lines advance character, setting, and theme. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves the opening motif. Minor figurative stacking in peak beats prevents a 9+ but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from overwriting: metaphors stack (“weaver between worlds,” “bridge,” “vessel of memory,” “portal”) without pruning, creating figurative density that blurs causality. Adjacent lines paraphrase (“preserve the color of wonder” / “guardian of wonder”; “radiant hush” repeated four times). In peak beats, abstractions replace concrete action (“felt the essence… being drawn into the seed”). Sentence openings vary well, but “she” begins 12 of 28 sentences, creating subtle monotony. Closure image glows but isn’t sharpened by leaner language.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence pressing heavier,” “restless energy” verge on abstract lyricism that blurs causality. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without payoff pattern. Final paragraph’s “mending the broken, she was also mending herself” risks pseudo-profundity. Otherwise, strong verbs (“exhume,” “sever,” “sagged”), varied syntax, and clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: “rain had scoured the walls, revealing layers of history like the rings of a tree” does setting, metaphor, and character worldview in one. Minimal loops; varied syntax. One slight overwriting in “her mind working like a puzzle solver”—cliché amid otherwise fresh imagery. Final paragraph’s “heal the divide” edges toward abstraction but is anchored by henge/chapel imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“synthetic snow swirl, a quiet reminder of something she couldn’t quite name”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths breathe with scene needs. Figurative language is precise (“silence as deep as the ocean”) without purple excess. Minor scaffold in “her method was always the same” slightly flattens momentum, but no loops, mixed metaphors, or artifacts dull the closure beat. Final line lands with rhythmic and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density (“spectral presence that had begun to haunt her dreams” conveys backstory and mood in one phrase). Figurative language is controlled—no purple prose—but “luminous figure, both ethereal and solid” risks slight abstraction. Minor scaffold in “her heart raced as she carefully placed…” (filter verb + adverb), but momentum holds. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, echoing the opening’s mist and melody.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structure. However, repetitive phrasing (“the elevator chimed,” “doors unfolded”) creates minor template cadence across floors. The phrase “warmly inquisitive” appears three times as a label rather than demonstrated behavior, triggering slight synonym churn. No fatal artifacts, but scaffolding in transitional beats slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“clouds stretched endlessly, their forms shifting like whispers in a dream”) and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary (“The sky gondola…”, “Elara’s work…”, “She raised…”), and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. Minor overwriting in the climax (“fragments of lives—laughter, tears…”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. Final line (“brass telescope gleaming softly”) echoes the opening’s “polished surface,” creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “silence that precedes an ending” establishes tone, setting, and stakes). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes then tightens near collapse. Minimal scaffolding—no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One slight risk: “fractally precise” appears twice, but context justifies recurrence. Closure beat is artifact-free, with clear cause/effect and earned cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “dog-ear of the polyglot’s phrasebook” and “stranded luminance—light trapped in time” verge on stacked modifiers. Minor scaffold in “her breath catching as she noticed...” followed by “she grabbed her quill...” could tighten. No loops or register drift, and rhythm supports mood. However, two adjacent sentences restate the board’s glow-beam transition, triggering a −0.3 paraphrase-loop deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is evocative yet precise, with high information density (“moonlight filtering through frosted windows,” “prophecies… shifting like shadows”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: “hauntingly bright glow” and “hauntingly bright light” repeat the same modifier, creating slight redundancy. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; propulsion remains steady toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: high-density figurative language in key beats (“waterfall of stars,” “tapestry of hope”) borders on purple without pattern-teaching payoff. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive constructions (“their laughter and tears mingling… hope no longer brambled but blooming”). Sentence variety sustains momentum, yet closure beat suffers slight register drift—elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” implied by tone) overshadows concrete action. No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally blurs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “dusk deepened, painting the world in shades of violet and ash”). Occasional overwriting—“pane of hush,” “hush of time’s final ripple”—edges toward abstraction without grounding. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent metaphors (“blade of hope,” “bruised awe”) slightly blur clarity in the climax. Momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “fractured spine against twilight sky” establishes setting, mood, and metaphor in one phrase. Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive sentences give way to staccato action beats. Minor overwriting in “offhandedly exact” description slightly stalls momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“something had changed”) avoids sentimentality by anchoring change in concrete cause: nut + blueprint.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence openings. High information density: “river foam caught her attention again, its chaotic beauty mirroring the turmoil in her mind” links image, action, and interiority. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats (“symphonically attuned,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent to “divergent path”), risking figurative density without payoff. No loops or scaffolding, but one near-paraphrase: “separation was not an end, but a step” / “use that separation as a bridge.”

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “books that seemed to grow like fruit,” “blade humming softly against the glass.” Figurative language is coherent (light = narrative potential) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in “whispers of unfinished tales drifted”—“drifted” weakens urgency—but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final line (“stories floated, eternal and ever-changing”) recharges motifs without redundancy. One near-paraphrase: “fragmented narratives” / “scattered fragments,” but not adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“coral walls frosted with ice,” “sandpaper rough memories”) and avoids synonym loops. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “her work complete” followed by “stepped back” slightly redundantly. Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors—but “sturdy brittle” as tone descriptor borders on abstract label-speak in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“hush of borrowed starlight,” “whispered tales of centuries past”), risking purple prose in high-pressure beats. Some redundancy appears (“crumbling relationships,” “crumbling silos”; “bridges from these silos,” “bridges stretched endlessly”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density occasionally blurs clarity—e.g., the clock “responding” to melody lacks grounded mechanics. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears: “entangled like vines in her mind” borders on mixed metaphor (vines ≠ quantum entanglement), and “quaking reverie” recurs without deepening. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “fractured relic,” “scattered remnants,” “fractured pieces” verge on synonym churn. Final beat avoids artifacts, and sentence openings vary effectively. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is often lyrical but occasionally overwrought (“air thick with… ancient secrets,” “latent blaze” repeated). Minor paraphrase loops: “forgotten combinations” appears four times with little variation. Figurative density is high in calm beats but thins appropriately during inversion. Final paragraph’s “heart alight with a latent blaze” echoes opening, but “legacy of protection and wisdom” risks pseudo-profundity. No syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Momentum stalls slightly in descriptive stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary (“In the intensely quiet…”, “She was a tree-song sculptor…”, “Her tools were simple…”), and paragraph lengths modulate breath. One minor flaw: “empathy in motion” appears as a near-label in exposition rather than dramatized action, risking abstraction. Otherwise, every line advances atmosphere, character, or motif. Final paragraph’s rhythm echoes the opening, creating closure through cadence—a masterful touch.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs (“hummed,” “draped,” “toppled”) and varied syntax, but suffers minor overwriting: “fleeting beauty she had grown to cherish” and “thoughtfully precise movements” verge on ornamental. One paraphrase loop: “silence could be a bridge, not a barrier” echoes earlier council argument without added pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Closure beat remains clear despite slight abstraction in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought—phrases like “tuning her frequencies to the subtle vibrations” risk abstraction. Minor redundancy appears (“the shadows deepening as if the workshop itself were holding its breath” echoes the opening). Sentence variety is strong, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. No fatal artifacts, though “symphony of sound” edges into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically varied, with strong sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “earthly aroma that seemed to resonate deep within her chest” leans into abstraction, and “undercurrent of wisdom surged through her” borders on diagnostic label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize the same emotional shift (“profound understanding… saw how her ambition…”). These don’t obscure closure but prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“whirling silence,” “shimmering river,” “emerald light” recur without variation). A paraphrase loop appears in the second paragraph (“floating rock arches… crisscrossed the horizon” then “weaving through the floating arches”). Sentence openings vary well, yet figurative density in the climax (“grove erupted in light”) borders on purple without grounding action. Momentum holds, but scaffolding phrases like “she knew she was close” could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrites: “insides spilled like the guts of a giant” clashes with otherwise restrained tone. Some redundancy (“rapidly adapting mind had already begun piecing together… but the patch was the key”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence lands cleanly, though “hazy, precise world” risks echoing without deepening earlier phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled; high information density with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., “amber music sheet… hues shifting like liquid sunlight trapped within ancient resin” establishes object, metaphor, and stakes). Occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (“emerald and sapphire… greens and pinks swirling like a living entity”) risks figurative saturation, but pattern is taught early and pays off. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s “quiet triumph” slightly verges on summary but is anchored in image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong but exhibits minor overwriting: “avalanchingly quiet” is striking but isolated; “sky seemed to crackle with unseen energy” borders on purple. A paraphrase loop appears in “determined to prevent history from repeating itself… sworn to understand what had gone wrong.” Final third avoids artifacts, but “weight both light and heavy” is a clichéd paradox. Rhythm varies well, though some sentence openings repeat (“She... She...”).

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong information density (“hands moved with practiced precision… mind wandered far beyond”). Sentence rhythm shifts with pressure—longer cadences early, shorter bursts during overwhelm. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (“labyrinth of mirrors,” “tapestry of joys and sorrows”) risks purple prose, though coherence holds. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line beautifully recharges the “glow” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“slung,” “rippling,” “thrum”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “seeds of stories waiting to germinate” borders on mixed metaphor when paired with “coaxed wonder.” Minor scaffold appears in repetitive references to vibration/hum/thrum across adjacent lines. No fatal loops, but the phrase “fade from memory to myth” recurs without deepening, slightly dulling momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite minor density bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density—e.g., “grief… clung to its edges like shadows” merges image, emotion, and object. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “thousand hues” and “captured stars,” but no loops or scaffold. Final beat avoids purple prose, grounding epiphany in physical action (cradling prism, rising to leave). One slight redundancy: “firmly grounded” appears twice without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (“fabric she wove was not of cloth but of silence”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs shift purposefully. However, slight overwriting occurs: “raveling silence” and “unraveling tapestry” risk metaphor collision, and “stoically sparkling” leans on label-like phrasing. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in peak beats borders on ornamental without always advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“pierced,” “coaxed,” “unfurling”) and purposeful imagery. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “molten lava and ancient runes” borders on stacked modifiers, and “blinding azure glow” leans generic. The mine descent suffers slight momentum drag due to summary (“hours turned into days”), though the climax regains propulsion. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase risk: “fragile hope” / “dying spirit” echo without deepening. Closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density in high-pressure moments (“air thickening like a curtain,” “shimmer,” “pulsed in rhythm with her heartbeat”), creating slight muddle. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“forgotten console” / “abandoned place”; “weave between worlds” repeated). Final paragraph’s “lifelines,” “nexus point,” and “journey just beginning” verge on generic uplift, dulling closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence variation and rhythmic control. Information density is high—objects carry multiple functions. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“luminescent ache that reminded him of something he couldn’t quite name”), bordering on abstract. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax: “protect what mattered most” followed by “safeguard its secrets, its history, its purpose.” Closure image remains sharp despite slight register lift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “beam slicing through the night like a sword of light” establishes setting, tone, and function). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the beam’s pulse. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shapes that should not exist,” “battle cry against the unknown”) edges toward purple prose but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolding; every image serves accumulation toward closure. Figurative language is coherent within the light/reflection motif.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—“amber and gold,” “kaleidoscope of colors” serve motif without purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts breathe with emotional beats. Minor scaffold: “quietly explosive” is stated then shown, slight redundancy. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s “muted but no less beautiful” risks sentimentality but lands due to concrete anchor (the wing in mist). High information density; every image advances theme or character.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is restrained yet potent (“moonlight painted the stone in silver,” “sorrow quantified in its brokenness”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve cadence. One near-miss: “mundane miracles unfolding” edges toward abstraction, but immediate concrete examples (child planting tree) anchor it. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“shimmered,” “knit,” “swaddled”) and varied sentence openings. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “a lullaby, a swaddle of sound that wrapped around her” uses near-synonym stacking (“lullaby/swaddle/wrapped”). No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences describe the mirror orchard’s stillness redundantly. Closure image remains clear despite minor figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished but occasionally over-figured (“enlarged tranquility,” “whispered tales of worlds unseen”), risking abstraction in peak beats. Minor redundancy: “crumpled invitation” appears three times with diminishing returns. Sentence variety holds, yet phrases like “keenly empathetic nature could flourish undisturbed” drift into diagnostic label-speak. Closure image remains clear despite these micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or motif. Sentence openings vary (“The air…”, “Among…”, “She paused…”) and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “heuristically gentle” and “tenuous absolution” leans slightly academic, but not enough to break POV. No loops or scaffold; the only flaw is a faint cadence repetition in the final paragraph (“She lit…”, “In this moment…”, “The bread…”), costing 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with high information density (“silence hung like a quartz hush,” “illusions crumbled”). Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the tremor (“library trembled… air crackled… device whirred”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “otherworldly luminescence” and “ethereal glow” verge on stacked modifiers, and “luminous vows resonating with new vitality” edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase near climax (“measure and preserve not just the slides but the truths they contained” echoes earlier lines).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and evocative, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “slipped,” “cracking”) and sensory specificity (“salt and decay”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Minor overwriting in “labyrinth of shadows and whispers”—a stock phrase—but quickly grounded in action. Closure beat avoids figurative muddle; final line (“crack… too late”) lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful: “aurora danced in ribbons,” “futuristic nostalgia,” and “tin compass ring humming” create texture without muddle. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in the climax (“convergence of her skepticism and her luminous spirit”)—a near-paraphrase of earlier ideas. No loops or scaffold, but one late register drift into conceptual phrasing slightly dulls immediacy. Overall, high information density with strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“hunched,” “shattered,” “nurturing”) and selective sensory detail. Occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“auroral sorrow of one who has finally faced the truth”)—elevated diction slightly jars the artist’s grounded POV. Minor paraphrase loop: “mechanical repetition of what others wanted” echoes earlier “lifeless portraits.” Still, momentum holds, and closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “toxic sky glowed an eerie orange” advances atmosphere and theme. Syntax varies effectively, though one minor paraphrase loop appears (“lost conversations… unspoken truths… whispers of the past”). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“first rays… smiled… glowing brighter”) resolves with earned uplift. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: metaphors stack (“frozen tears of the gods,” “canvas upon which the world painted”) without causal propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops (“symphony that resonated… symphony of truth”) dilute momentum. Sentence variety is strong, yet peak beats suffer slight figurative density—glisten/spin/light motifs repeat without escalation. Final paragraph tightens effectively, redeeming earlier sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly concise, with high information density (“hands... etched with faint lines mimicking human age”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “shadowy forms, writhing and chaotic” edges into stacked modifiers, and “brutal” process lacks concrete physicality. One paraphrase loop: “resolve the static” / “static... fading into silence.” Not severe, but prevents 8.5+; closure image remains clear despite minor figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, with strong sensory verbs (“painted,” “mingling,” “tracing”) and varied syntax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences advance atmosphere and plot. One flaw: the phrase “the sandstorm calm of the moment settling over her” mixes incompatible textures—“sandstorm” implies chaos, “calm” stillness—creating a minor figurative muddle at a peak beat. Otherwise, high information density and clean mechanics support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “shadows danced upon crumbling walls,” “whispered secrets to those who dared listen,” “breath life into the echoes of brilliance” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“coded journal entries became her map… each one leading her closer”). Still, information density is high, rhythm supports mood, and the final lines land cleanly. One too many decorative metaphors in peak beats prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with strong verbs (“exhume,” “pulse,” “slipping”) and varied sentence openings. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (light/shadow/memory motif). One paraphrase loop: “fragments of light” / “fleeting but vivid” adjacent lines slightly redundant. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, though “lantern lighter’s heart alight” edges toward mixed metaphor. Momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured: “weaving threads of moonlight,” “tranquil blaze that would consume everything” verge on purple in high-pressure beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“fragments… whispered secrets… coded words” → “prophecy’s whispers… coded words”). Sentence openings vary well, but “Elara” begins four consecutive sentences mid-story, creating slight cadence drag. Final image (“crane’s wing tucked safely”) lands cleanly, though “illuminated her path” risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative: “rooftops whispered secrets to the stars” establishes tone economically. Varied syntax sustains momentum, though one paraphrase loop appears (“patiently nimble, as though he could adapt to any response” echoes prior description). No filter-verb stacks; closure beat (“The journey had begun”) avoids overwriting. Figurative language is coherent, though “borrowing sugar” metaphor verges on opaque without fuller grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative density peaks appropriately during memory flood. Minor overwriting in “tragically radiant” repetition and “sea of light and shadow” verges on abstraction. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold, though “velvet garden” appears three times without evolving function—slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “calloused from years of crafting false histories” conveys backstory, profession, and moral ambiguity in one phrase. Sentence variety supports rhythm—participles for immersion (“pressing the rose thorn”), fragments for impact (“A canvas”). One paraphrase loop: “unlink the threads of truth from the fabric of time” / “unlink the words” slightly redundant. No scaffold or momentum drag; figurative language serves theme without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is evocative and largely momentum-driven, with high information density in key lines (“her voice... carried the weight of centuries”). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., the chamber scene), risking overwriting. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“webs of intrigue began to unravel... echoes were not random but deliberate”). The final paragraph’s cadence is strong, but “eternal symphony” edges toward generic closure. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but density occasionally blurs causality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“her life a tapestry woven from fragments of others’ stories”) and varied syntax that breathes with scene tempo. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“borrowed starlight,” “tapestry woven”) but doesn’t blur causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Final line’s cadence (“warmth could be found”) slightly flattens the preceding tension but doesn’t dull closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“scintillatingly somber,” “moon paths”) without sufficient grounding in action. Minor paraphrase loops appear (e.g., repeated emphasis on “hidden effort” and “unseen threads”), and the elevated diction occasionally edges toward abstraction. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and most lines carry thematic or atmospheric weight. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but not flawlessly lean.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clean with strong verbs (“sinking,” “pulsed,” “coalesced”) and varied syntax. Information density is high—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “her chant becoming a scream” followed by “The stillpoint shuddered, then stabilized” edges toward summary. One paraphrase loop: “fragile balance that required constant vigilance” echoes earlier “excavate truth, no matter the cost.” Closure image remains sharp despite these micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats: “cascade of energy,” “thousand shards of light,” “otherworldly light” cluster without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops (“fragments of the future… fragmented radio frequencies”) and stock phrases (“bittersweet expression,” “holding its breath”) slightly dull propulsion. Final paragraph’s “gritty, whimsical hope” borders on label-speak, though overall momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied sentence structures, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent (“melody spilling like a river breaking free”) and rarely overdone. Minor overwriting appears in the opening paragraph (“lonesome splendor that echoed through the cracked wooden beams”)—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. The shattered jar beat is clean, and the final lines avoid summary, trusting the image of lighter jars and golden dunes to carry thematic weight. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and descriptions are dense with purpose (“scent of brine and whisper of ancient secrets”). However, peak beats suffer minor overwriting: “harmonic resonance that seemed to bypass Elara’s ears and speak directly to her soul” blends mixed sensory logic. No paraphrase loops, but “vibration” repeats without escalation in mechanics, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms propulsion: phrases like “sculpt patience from impatience” and “unyoke the chaos” repeat as near-synonyms without added pressure. The final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop (“softly purposeful revolution… begun in the heart”) that dulls closure impact. No syntactic monotony or grammar errors, but minor overwriting prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrites: “entangled memories of the past had become her weapon” and “reverberation of the truth was deafening” verge on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary adequately, though three consecutive sentences begin with “She” near the climax. Information density is high, but “watchful calm” and “fortified vulnerability” are repeated as labels rather than demonstrated. Final paragraph’s “smiled, knowing she had finally broken free” risks sentimentality, dulling the preceding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical: “vibrant hush,” “life unraveling like a broken spring.” Sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “gnawed,” “forecloses”). Minor overwriting in “delicate piece… not irreparable” leans slightly purple, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph propels cleanly to closure without artifact interference.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“churned,” “whirred,” “skewered”) and varied syntax. However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “resonant hum that seemed to vibrate through her very soul” leans purple, and “chaotic harmony” is abstract. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize the algorithm’s purpose rather than dramatize it. Closure beat remains clear despite minor figurative bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, varied in rhythm, and dense with purpose: “frayed piece of fabric,” “static and then silence,” “sensed absence” all do double duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “something’s pulling us in”—could be more concrete—but overall, high information density with zero fluff. Final line lands with poetic precision without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “rippling,” “converged”) and purposeful figurative language. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift for rhythm, and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “pulsed faintly with an otherworldly energy,” “whispering that the answers lay not in the vast expanse…” verge on purple prose. No loops or scaffolding, but one paraphrase near the end (“mend what had been broken” / “mend even the deepest fractures”) slightly dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence earns its place. Minor overwriting appears in “fold in patience” (used twice abstractly) and “windborne solace” (repeated label), but these don’t obscure closure. The final image—parasol aloft under aurora—propels momentum to a resonant stop without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density—e.g., “vines leaned toward another, yet none ever touched” conveys both setting and theme. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“passionate subtlety,” “gently persuasive”), drifting toward label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one instance of therapy-adjacent phrasing (“intersubjective understanding”) slightly dulls immediacy without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought (“kinetic parapet,” “conjured clearings” border on jargon). Minor redundancy: “whisperfield calm” appears three times; “echo of wisdom” twice. No scaffold loops, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (consecration scene) slightly muddles immediacy. Final line strong, though “beacon” risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but largely controlled, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “loomed,” “transmute”) and varied sentence rhythms. However, minor overwriting appears: “earnest whimsy of her task became apparent” borders on label-speak, and “testament to time’s relentless march” verges on cliché. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences restate the vines’ whispering function, slightly dulling momentum. Closure image remains clear despite these hairline slips.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “suspended hush,” “weathered innocence,” “fractured bursts” do thematic and atmospheric work. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. However, slight overwriting in peak beat: “a bittersweet victory… bear witness to both the beauty and the fragility” edges toward abstraction. Not enough to obscure closure, but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose balances poetic density (“metal and stone forms shrouded in a damp veil”) with propulsion—no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fog as muter, sculptures as memory-objects) and pays off at closure. Minor deduction: “resonant hum, like the vibration of a string plucked long ago” slightly strains metaphor coherence after concrete buildup. Otherwise, sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“burned,” “spiraling,” “restructured”) and varied syntax. Occasional overwriting: “luminous ache” borders on label-speak; “ephemeral” appears twice abstractly. No paraphrase loops, but “changelessly constant stillness” edges toward redundancy. Final paragraph’s “harnessed not just the ephemeral, but the very essence of time itself” slightly inflates—otherwise, high information density and clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory verbs and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“air shimmered with a soft, eternal glow”). No paraphrase loops, but “hymning the mundane” and “execute a flawless goodbye” verge on conceptual labels rather than embodied action. Final paragraph’s cadence is effective, yet “scent of hope linger long after she was gone” leans abstract. Information density is high, but minor register drift in thematic phrasing dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence openings, purposeful paragraph breaks, and high information density (e.g., “spoons bent reality” conveys era in three words). Minor scaffold appears in “fragments of her mentor’s teachings” and “echoes of a forgotten song”—slight paraphrase loops that don’t obscure causality. One register drift: “sealed awakenings—a concept Elara had spent years studying” edges toward academic tone, but not severely. Final beat avoids overwriting; closure image is clean and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs (“loomed,” “crunching,” “erupted”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“translucent enamel catching the light like a fragment of moon” borders on purple). No paraphrase loops, but the phrase “cleft in certainty” is repeated without deepening. Final paragraph’s “nostalgic innovation” disrupts immersion with abstract diction. Overall momentum is strong, but figurative density slightly dulls the climax’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. However, two adjacent lines restate the glass’s glow (“colors intensifying… becoming a mirror”), triggering a paraphrase-loop penalty. Also, “zephyr bloom” in the final sentence feels unearned—a decorative flourish that slightly dulls the otherwise resonant closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with high information density (“moss clung… like nature reclaiming its throne”). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “honeyed hush” repetition slightly dilutes impact, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s amber light ties back cleanly, sustaining momentum without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Occasional overwriting (“swirling hush,” “feral nexus”) risks purple prose, but pattern is taught early and pays off. No paraphrase loops, though “whispers grew louder” appears twice with minimal variation. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves cleanly, though “carrying the stories... into the future” leans slightly generic compared to earlier specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; most sentences advance atmosphere or character. Figurative density peaks appropriately during the song sequence (“golden threads… forming intricate patterns”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “stories of the land and its people” followed by “each thread held a remedy” risks redundancy. No scaffold loops or register drift, but the phrase “spun golden stories into the world” appears twice, slightly marring originality in diction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished (“moving stillness,” “sky wept its brilliance”), risking figurative density in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, but repeated use of “safekept starlight” and “patience” edges toward motif reinforcement without variation. Sentence propulsion falters slightly during the humming sequence, where description momentarily stalls momentum. Still, information density is high, and the final paragraph’s rhythm earns its quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “warm, like sunlight on skin, and fragile, like the first snowflake of winter” uses two similes where one would suffice, slightly muddying the closure image. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in the final paragraph edges toward purple prose, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically (short staccato queries vs. flowing descriptions), and every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“calcified,” “fractal,” “shingled hush”) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “whalebone reverie” risks obscurity but is grounded by context. No loops or scaffold—each image (starlight, lamp, grotto walls) evolves functionally. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“steady and true… found its purpose”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and economical, though occasional figurative density (“time itself had crystallized”) borders on overwriting. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports mood without monotony. Minor redundancy in “hauntingly practical” repetition, but not looped. Closure beat remains clear and uncluttered—final lines resonate without scaffold or paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “regret clung to her like a second skin” embodies emotion economically. Sentence variety supports momentum, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting appears in the opening (“currents that danced to rhythms no one could hear”)—a near-stock lyricism—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; the camera wheel’s hum is reintroduced with evolving function, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“labyrinth of intentions frozen in time” borders on redundant). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “maze of intentions” repeated without added pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Closure beat (“guiding his steps toward the next horizon”) risks cliché but is earned by prior specificity. No filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “glacial hush that cradled her like a forgotten melody” does triple duty (atmosphere, character, motif). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or texture. Minor overwriting in “excruciatingly gentle precision” (slight redundancy) and one mixed metaphor (“tugged at her chest like an old wound” clashes with auditory “whispers”), but clarity remains intact. Final line (“home”) resonates without purple prose, earning high marks despite hairline figurative slips.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “salvage,” “rotting”) and sensory specificity. However, minor overwriting appears: “serene upheaval,” “relentless pursuit of forgotten truths,” and “hindsight clarity in a world built on uncertainty” verge on abstract lyricism. One paraphrase loop: “layers of deception” / “buried beneath layers of deception.” Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but the phrase “salvaged a truth that would change everything” edges toward generic assertion. Momentum holds, though density dips in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“weathered planks muffled by a soft, crystalline blanket”) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in “infinitely patient” (label-like) and slight synonym proximity (“whisper of the weavers” / “secret weavers”), but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s “glowing softly” risks vagueness, yet closure remains sharp due to accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “silhouette dissolving into twilight like a memory slipping away” merges image, metaphor, and mood. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriting in “lonesome splendor” (repeated twice) risks purple prose, but doesn’t obscure closure. Final paragraph’s star metaphor ties back cleanly to the ship’s departure, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “quaking,” “shimmering”) and varied syntax. A slight overreliance on adjectives in the opening (“crystalline spires,” “luminescent fungi”) risks purple prose, but momentum holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; the machine’s cold voice contrasts effectively with organic imagery. Final paragraph’s rhythm supports thematic resonance without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “legacy clung like black sand”). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (kelp, fire, migration) and pays off cohesively. One paraphrase loop: “grace that belied her burden” / “movements as fluid as kelp” slightly overlaps conceptually. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; rhythm varies effectively. Final paragraph avoids overwriting despite lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water once sang through stone lips” establishes tone economically. Sentence openings vary (“Among the city’s inhabitants…”, “The box had arrived…”), and paragraphs breathe with scene rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“cascade of color, spilling memories like liquid starlight”) borders on purple but serves closure. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“only the beginning”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “colors swirled like whispers of forgotten dreams” and “light no longer confined to their petals but spilling into the air like liquid silver” border on purple. Minor paraphrase-loop in the sonar pinging sequence (“fragment of the past, a whisper of the future, and a hint of the present”). Figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats, slightly dulling propulsion. Still, syntax varies purposefully, and the final paragraph achieves resonant clarity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, avoiding syntactic monotony. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “fleeting symphony of color and motion” and “thundering calm” verge on mixed metaphor (how can calm thunder?). A paraphrase loop occurs in the reflection on Tomas’s advice—reiterated twice without added pressure. These don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ due to slight figurative muddle in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“sea whispered secrets to the stone,” “pendulum bob… heart of the mechanism”) and coherent. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the narrative cadence, and there’s minimal scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“moments they took for granted” / “moments we take for granted” implied) and slight overwriting in the final paragraph (“searing reverie,” “incremental grace”) nudge it below 9.0, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but metaphors remain coherent (tapestry as map, silo as sentinel). Minor overwriting: “fingers tenderly organized around a trowel” is slightly contorted; “uncharted echoes” repeats without evolution. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences begin with “Elias…” in the middle section, creating mild syntactic monotony. Closure image is sharp, though “stories he had untangled” risks abstraction after concrete thread-work.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished with varied syntax and high information density (“The nib, crafted from the feather’s tip, was said to hold the power to write the future”). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “words spilling onto the page in a cascade of possibility” leans purple. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “frozen lake” repeats four times without evolution. Final paragraph’s “transformation had begun” is functional but lacks the lyrical punch of earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence variety supports momentum, though two adjacent sentences paraphrase the radio’s glow spreading (“casting... luminescence,” “as if alive”). Minor overwriting in “cloak herself in the mystery” risks abstraction, but closure image (“one note, one word, at a time”) earns its lyricism. No scaffold loops or register drift; artifacts are minimal and non-impairing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ash spill into her palm,” “porcelain mask... shattered like the man’s belief”), though occasional figurative stacking (“somber marvel,” “silent benediction”) borders on overwriting. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with emotional cadence. One minor paraphrase loop: “fragile... fracture... piece together” in adjacent lines. Closure beat remains clear despite slight lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and controlled, with strong verbs and selective detail (“fingers tracing intricate patterns,” “sun dipped below the horizon”). However, minor scaffold appears: “his rationally rebellious mind refusing to let go” and “abrasive calm often masked the turmoil within” verge on label-speak. One paraphrase loop exists: “the world had ended, but why did it have to end like this?” followed by near-redundant reflection on chaos. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, but “eerie glow” and “labyrinth of broken towers” flirt with generic post-apocalyptic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density: “velvet library,” “zither soundhole rosette,” “traveled stillness” each pull double duty. However, overwriting flares in peak beats: “carvings glowing faintly with each note” leans into figurative excess without payoff. A paraphrase loop appears: “silence they had replaced” echoes earlier “hollow silence of unlearning hatred” without added pressure. Final paragraph’s “beacon of hope” risks abstraction but is anchored by the rosette’s physical gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and economical, with strong verbs (“twisted,” “imbue,” “foreclose”) and controlled figurative language. However, two adjacent sentences restate the celestial alignment’s importance (“timing was perfect… once-in-a-lifetime event”), creating a minor paraphrase loop. The phrase “synaptic plasticity” appears without integration, feeling like a label dropped in rather than woven through action. Final paragraph avoids purple prose, but “memories flooded her—not just hers…” edges toward abstraction. Otherwise, rhythm and density serve momentum well.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though “gleaming with intricate patterns that seemed to shift” and “pulsating with faint, blue light” verge on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loop: “dormant energy” / “tower dormant.” Final paragraph’s “amber and gold” / “heart of the city itself” leans slightly generic. Still, rhythm varies, information density is high, and no artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting in “sacred” and “silent pact” edges toward purple, but figurative language is mostly coherent. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong verbs (“stumbled,” “threaded,” “fracturing”) and varied syntax. Figurative language is controlled, though “tapestry of whispers” and “breathing nuance” flirt with abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; momentum flows cleanly. One near-redundancy: “fragility of her solution” echoes “structural weakness” closely, but not enough to trigger loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“boundless yet confining… boundless confinement”) slightly dulls the final image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (dice as relics, staircase as life) and pays off cleanly—no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm sustains momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ink… shimmered like the night sky,” “smog-choked city”) and avoids scaffold loops or synonym churn. Sentence openings vary (“Inside, Elara…” / “She dipped it…” / “As she worked…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting occurs in the daydream sequence (“voices weaving a melody that resonated in her chest”)—a touch abstract for peak pressure—but clarity never falters. The final third maintains propulsion, with zero filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors marring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong verbs (“cradled,” “kneaded,” “thaw”) and selective sensory layering. Minor overwriting in “rosewater dread”—a poetic but slightly opaque coinage—and one paraphrase loop (“rescue dying arts… preserve the stories… ensure Verdania’s heart never stopped beating”). No scaffold sentences; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“families gathered… sharing stories… kneaded dough”) mirrors communal renewal without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“latent radiance pulsing in time with Elias’s heartbeat” leans purple). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one minor redundancy: “bleak exhilaration” is named, then restated as “tinged with unease.” Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line resonates without summary. Figurative language is coherent but dense in peak beats—cost clarity slightly blurred by lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: “skeletal reminder of forgotten joys,” “repulsive allure that both repelled and fascinated” lean on stacked modifiers. Figurative density is high in peak beats without payoff—e.g., “lingering luminance” appears three times with diminishing returns. No paraphrase loops, but template cadence emerges in “In one… In another…” constructions. Final lines achieve propulsion, though “the world felt brighter” risks generic uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, advancing atmosphere and action simultaneously. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fractal patterns expanding and contracting in time with the note”) edges toward density without muddle. No loops or scaffold—every line serves momentum. Final paragraph’s “one note at a time” recharges the mallet motif with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and controlled, with strong verbs (“gnawed,” “shimmer,” “pulsing”) and varied sentence rhythms. Minor redundancy in “quietly driven… resolve unshaken” and “labyrinth of spirals… each turn etched” slightly dulls momentum. No loops or scaffold dominate, but “dread” appears three times without evolution. Final paragraph’s “hope that the patterns would lead her” borders on telling—but earns it through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure, though occasional overwriting appears (“its platforms swallowed by ivy,” “loom weaving threads”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but figurative density in early paragraphs borders on purple without payoff. Information density is high—most lines advance theme or character—but the ledger’s riddle (“The truth is a seed…”) feels templated. Closure beat remains clear, avoiding artifact penalties that would block high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density (“pillars bore carvings of hands reaching upward”). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “absence of those who once gathered, the absence of the dreams” slightly redundant. Figurative language (“hushed blaze”) appears in multiple beats but is pattern-taught early and pays off in the calm lagoon ending, avoiding overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery (“water lapped at the edges of crumbling stone,” “silence so profound it seemed to hum”), but suffers from mild overwriting: “dappled resolve,” “tranquilly perceptive,” and “reclaimed stillness” verge on label-speak. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally slows momentum (e.g., three successive metaphor-laden sentences in paragraph 2). Closure beat is clear, though the stamp’s “glowing faintly” borders on convenience. Read-aloud rhythm is mostly fluid, with varied sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“mist clung to the air like a lover’s whisper” establishes setting, tone, and emotional texture). Sentence variety supports rhythm—no template cadence. One minor overwriting slip: “luminous torment” leans slightly abstract, but it’s redeemed by immediate embodiment in folded cranes. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every sentence propels character, atmosphere, or conflict. Final line (“honor it”) crystallizes theme without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally strong but exhibits minor overwriting: “intangibly tangible energy” is oxymoronic without payoff, and “unfiltered awakening” appears twice as label-like refrain. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of her old life” / “piece herself back together” within three lines. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, but “hunter of light in the darkness” verges on cliché. Otherwise, high information density and syntactic variety support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with strong verbs and selective detail (“boots echoing,” “tattered tapestry”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“otherworldly light,” “brilliant dimness”) edges toward purple prose. No paraphrase loops, but “perpetually surprised” repeats as label without embodiment. Final paragraph’s “quiet resolve” lands cleanly, though “star trails as roadmap” verges on cliché. Overall momentum sustained with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cobalt terrace seemed to shimmer, its tiles reflecting the fading sky like a fractured mirror” establishes tone, setting, and theme in one stroke. Minor overwriting in “gnawing at him like a relentless tide” slightly dilutes an otherwise sharp metaphor set. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or pressure. Final line (“fractured pieces of his own soul”) recharges the opening image with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “mist that clung to the stones like forgotten secrets”). However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase: “apologies and forgiveness are not currencies… They are seeds…” risks redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; the “living witness” mist borders on mixed metaphor. No scaffold loops, but slight overwriting in peak beats (“storm-worn and windblown” repeated) nudges score down.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“lapped,” “gravitate,” “flickering”) and varied sentence openings. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “melancholic echo of her own fractured heart” mixes therapy-speak with mixed metaphor. A paraphrase loop occurs in the reflection on poles (“functional, neither beautiful, but necessary” echoes earlier lines). These artifacts don’t obscure closure but prevent 9+ eligibility per Q7 guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“shimmered,” “waded,” “swirled”) and varied syntax. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “fragments of his past still lingered… distant, like echoes in a cave” followed by “his past clung to him like a shadow” risks synonym churn. The phrase “delicately robust” appears twice—functional but slightly repetitive. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffolding prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, but occasional overwriting dilutes impact: “feathers gleaming like molten gold,” “scent was intoxicating, a siren’s song” verge on stacked modifiers. One paraphrase loop: “reforge a bond beyond death” / “bond beyond death” in closing. Final paragraph repeats “paradoxically steady” verbatim—a missed opportunity for evolved phrasing. Still, rhythm supports mood, and information density remains high across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “porcelain edge jagged against the mossy ground” conveys texture, position, and metaphor). Figurative language is pattern-taught: “hum,” “whispered,” “glow” evolve from atmospheric to active. Minor overwriting in “kaleidoscope of what could have been”—slightly abstract amid concrete imagery—but doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances character, setting, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, though occasional overwriting (“symphony of existence,” “fractures in her soul”) borders on purple. Minor paraphrase loop: “gravitationally lighter” repeated without progression. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, but “ghostly resolve” feels label-like. No syntactic monotony; varied openings and paragraph lengths support momentum. Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—e.g., “black sand beach, where the earth met the sea in a timeless dance” establishes setting, tone, and theme in one stroke. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“vibrant hush filling the air”), risking figurative saturation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “whispering hush” repeats four times, verging on motif fatigue. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully mirrors renewal, though “pieces of a larger puzzle” leans slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong verbs (“hummed,” “roared,” “slipped”) and varied syntax. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “cascade of light and energy erupting from the fort’s core” leans decorative, and “winking hush” risks abstraction. No fatal loops, but “faint flicker of dying torches” / “faint shimmer of stars” shows minor synonym proximity. Momentum holds, though density dips momentarily in exposition about the cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative language serves momentum (“aurora danced like a borrowed dawn”). Sentences vary in structure and length, avoiding monotony. One paraphrase loop: “fragments of the future… never with clarity” echoed later as “fragments… grasp the whole.” Minor scaffold in “world seemed to hold its breath” → “world felt different,” but not severe enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery (“clouds themselves seemed to conspire in secrecy”) and strong verbs (“slipped,” “wedged,” “plunging”), though occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“fear, hope, regret, all dissolving into a singular clarity”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one mixed metaphor—“storm-kissed wonder”—strains logic (storms don’t kiss). Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports emotional arc. Final line’s thunderclap flourish is effective but slightly theatrical.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sunlight splintered through crystalline walls” does triple duty (setting, theme, mood). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts align with rhetorical beats. Minor overwriting in “fractured rainbows across the stone floor”—“fractured” echoes “splintered” unnecessarily. No loops or scaffold, but one near-paraphrase: “carve certainty from the labyrinth of uncertainty” borders on redundant phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong information density—most lines advance character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and figurative language is largely coherent (“streets whispered tales of decay,” “poems... luminous fracture”). Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“words flowing like a river breaking through a dam”), slightly blurring immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one or two adjectives lean generic (“quiet pride,” “newfound vitality”).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously (“battered, still held a melody that could stir the soul”). Figurative language is consistent (tidal, arboreal, cinematic motifs) without muddle. One paraphrase loop: “flickering compasses… spinning wildly” then “erratic movements” slightly redundant. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters marginally with “horizon invited night”—passive construction—but the closing image redeems it. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, high information density.

    High information density: sentences advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful (“magic and reality intertwined like vines”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “luminous doubt” and “empirically whimsical” edges toward label-speak, but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s cadence swells effectively, though “renewed commitment” slightly abstracts what the image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “shimmered,” “diffuse”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in phrases like “rhythmically placid melody” and “otherworldly light” edges toward abstraction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “tides of remembrance” borders on label-speak. Final paragraph propels cleanly to closure without artifacts dulling the resonant last line.
