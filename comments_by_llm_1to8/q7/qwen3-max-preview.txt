  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn weaken propulsion: "not triumph—it was subtraction" / "Subtract the noise"; "Not coincidence. / Synchrony"; "Not to hide, but to heal. / Not to forget, but to transform." Template cadence runs across the middle section ("No grand declarations. / No forced epiphanies. / Only the quiet accumulation…"). Stock metaphors appear without fresh inflection ("canyon taught her"; "purposes isn't a destination"). Information density is low in the visitor passage, which summarizes rather than dramatizes. Filter verbs and abstract nouns ("purpose," "meaning," "resonance") recur without concrete anchors in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure image, triggering caps.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "not broken, not exactly—just silently expressive" restates the same content; "not to mourn, but to rectify—not the disaster, nor the silence, but the assumption" cycles through near-synonyms without adding pressure. Template cadence in the climax section: "She smiled... She didn't need... Her skin... Her bones... Her heart..." The final third lists abstractions ("Love. Loss. Longing. Laughter") in place of concrete image, and "unshaken marvels" appears as a thematic echo rather than earned particular.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the mission or deepens the undertaker's relationship to rest. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer sentences during embedding and shorter ones at the kneeling beat. Minor overwriting appears in figurative density: "frozen lightning," "ghost-light," "tidal pull of unfinished business," "amber radiance"—each apt but clustering in the first half without pattern-teaching. One paraphrase loop: "not a grave / Not a marker / But a place" followed immediately by "The lens...no longer broadcasted distress. / It broadcasted belonging." No clarity harm to closure; the loop serves emphasis but could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across the text. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or symbolic weight. Minor loops appear: "The bell stayed silent. For now. The story hadn't ended. It had simply passed into other hands" recycles the continuation idea across adjacent lines (−0.2). Figurative language ("hunger followed like a shadow," "frost feathered the ridge") is selective and coherent. No template cadence or register drift; clarity and momentum remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences ("brass instrument humming with the breath of the wind," "petals became faces," "archways became arms") without escalation pattern or clear closure linkage, triggering density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "not nostalgia, nor penance" / "Not discarded, not wasted" / "Not a person, not exactly" recur as template negations. "The artist's breath hitched" is the lone embodied reaction in a quest framed as spiritual curiosity. Information density is moderate; clarity holds, but momentum sags under ornamental layering and repetitive stems reduce propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "sky bruised violet," "roots became ceilings," "slick, yes, but layered, like oil on water." However, several lines loop or restate: "not haunted by the past, but woven into it" followed immediately by "each step forward dragging her senses through yesterday's breath, tomorrow's sigh" paraphrases the same concept. The closing catalogue—"Grief was coarse. Joy, unexpectedly porous. Anticipation? A lattice of needles and velvet."—reads as list rather than propulsion. Minor filter-verb stack in the final paragraphs ("felt it," "felt time's grain") slightly dulls immediacy. Overwriting is present but contained; the density serves the textural lens without fully obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high; most sentences carry image, action, or thematic weight. Syntactic variety supports rhythm. However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without always clarifying—"staggering grace…not because she moved like a dancer, but because she moved like soil after rain" is striking but muddles the vehicle. Template openings recur: "She knelt," "She pressed," "She stepped," "She began to walk" across consecutive paragraphs. Paraphrase loop in final third: "They'd find music instead. And green. Always, eventually, green" repeats the inevitability claim without added detail. Line-level craft is strong but artifacts touch the closure beats, triggering mid-band placement and disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift across paragraphs; information density is high in forge and closure beats. However, patterned artifacts cluster in the middle: "She closed her eyes and listened," "She froze," "She reached," "She smiled," "She packed," "She climbed"—a run of identical "She [verb]" stems across six beats. This template cadence dulls immediacy during the turn and departure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7. Additionally, "the sound of trust breaking" and "the frequency of fracture" loop as near-synonyms without added pressure. Figurative density is high (aurora as heartbeat, forge burning absences, ash curling into hands) but remains mostly coherent. No major clarity breaks, and the final image propels cleanly. The artifacts do not obscure closure but prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bleeding the last hues of a fleeting golden sunset," "shadows pooled like spilled ink," "swirled like liquid mercury," "cathedral of crossings." Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "She believed fate spoke in patterns" followed immediately by examples rephrasing the same claim; "not theft, but revelation. Not capture, but release" recycles structure without new information (−0.4). Template cadence: "She moved… her fingers… her eyes…" and "She didn't speak. She never did. Instead, she placed…" (−0.4). The final third's exposition ("This was her art—not theft, but revelation") stacks summary over image. Cumulative artifact penalty −1.4; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("breath curling like steam," "quiet glow of molten silica"). However, the piece carries paraphrase loops: "not to reclaim power, but to abandon it" is restated across multiple beats without advancing pressure. The recursive "not X, but Y" template appears in five adjacent paragraphs, flattening propulsion. Metaphor density in the final third ("fossilized prayer," "weightless gravity") borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff. Pronoun references and spatial choreography remain clear; no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "outwit the ghost of my former self" / "prove that even the most broken, trembling thing—me—can turn betrayal into liberation" restate the same thesis. Template cadence runs through multiple beats ("I used to be…," "Now I'm just…," "Tonight, though…," "I'm firmly adaptive…"). Mixed metaphors abound: "velvet-wrapped poison," "guilt is a slow tide," "trebling certainty is my armor," "baptized in trembling certainty" all within a single narrative without taught pattern or payoff. Register drifts into elevated diction ("rewired my bones," "weaponized," "cognitive smoothness") inconsistent with a stunt double under stress. Filter-verb stacks ("I feel it," "I whisper") and stock phrases ("the stars above blink like witnesses") dull immediacy in peak beats, including the closure. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.3)
    Figurative language ("honeyed resin trapping ancient breath," "dunes under moonless gusts," "throat of oblivion") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "the silence after…; the hush when…; the stillness between…" is template repetition without added pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("broken shell cradling a single pearl") and filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she believed") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("marbled hush: striated, calm"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Rhythm is uniform; no propulsion variation despite the storm/hush contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance both world-building and the loop structure. The piece reads cleanly with no grammar errors or pronoun confusion. Minor loop issue: "The Second Chance Program hadn't granted it freedom—it granted recursion" and the subsequent loop explanation overlap conceptually across three paragraphs without added pressure. Some figurative density in early beats ("twilight draped," "frost on glass," "bruised twilight") accumulates without clear pattern-teaching, though it doesn't obscure causality. The final image is charged and propulsive. Overall strong craft with hairline accumulation that doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("liquid stars," "calcified," "vibrated in the marrow," "silver glow...like forgiveness") without pattern-teaching or escalation; many metaphors are stock or strained. Template cadence appears in paired clauses: "No one spoke. / No one needed to." and "not as a tool, but as a relic." Paraphrase loops: "quiet courage of exposure, the willingness to be seen" restates without adding pressure. The prose is grammatically clean but over-decorated, slowing momentum. Line-level clarity holds, but information density is low—many lines describe mood rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (each marble touch advances character and theme). Clarity and momentum are strong through the altar scene. Overwriting friction: figurative language appears densely in some beats ("organic rebellion," "pages," "vein of gold," "question mark made flesh") without always earning the load; the final paragraph stacks metaphors (glowing, veins of gold, breathing, blooming/withering sigh) that blur rather than sharpen. Apply −0.5 for density and coherence drift in peak beats. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is often vivid but suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence. "Mechanically warm" appears four times in similar constructions, creating a thematic loop. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "Light fractured—not shattered, but peeled, like layers of an onion peeled through holographic principles" stacks vehicles awkwardly. Paraphrase loops appear ("The station exhaled… The station inhaled"; "not younger, not older—but adjacent" echoed by "not fading, but stepping out of phase"). The peak beat—lever pull and adjacency vision—is laden with metaphor that obscures rather than propels. Apply −1.0 for template stems, loops, and density without payoff, plus the line-artifact cap disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: figurative language in most sentences ("lily pads," "broken reeds," "smoke," "glyphs," "shimmering," "liquid shadows," "motes of glitter," "spiraling arpeggios") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a −0.7 deduction. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to play, but to listen—not with ears, but with skin" / "not fame, nor closure, but unraveling" / "not in words, but in gestures" recycle parallel syntax without added pressure, adding −0.4. Mixed metaphors: water "whispered secrets" while also "composing" and "conducting"—vehicles blur. Template cadence: "She believed...she knew" / "She'd come...She'd spent" / "She laid...angled...watched." Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8. Information density is moderate; momentum drags under decorative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The illustration fluttered in her grip, the smudged orchid trembling in the gale" conveys action, object state, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density lapse: "It did not celebrate. It endured. As she would." reads slightly staccato and on-the-nose after strong prior work; the final philosophical aside ("in the quiet courage of unswallowed words yet to come") edges toward scaffold. Figurative language is vivid and coherent without overwriting the high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer syntactic builds ("She'd mapped their testimonies, cross-referenced timestamps...") and terse beats ("Not ghostly. Not glowing. Just brass"). Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or interiority. Minor scaffold appears: "She'd come not for thrills, not for photos, but for the weight" and "Not ghostly. Not glowing. Just brass" employ template negation that, while voice-consistent, repeats cadence. The phrase "drowsy alertness" recurs three times, twice early and once late, creating slight synonym churn. Figurative language is purposeful (valve wheel as guilt machinery, "dust falling...like silent applause") but the closure paragraph slightly over-explains theme ("mind's machinery grinding backward") where image could carry more weight. No severe loops or artifacts, but minor density slips prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and sustained: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("silence wasn't absence—it was regenerative silence," "forests grew teeth," "lovers became constellations"). In peak beats (the refuge vision, the final paragraph), the layered imagery occasionally muddles clarity without adding pressure. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("not broken, not healed, but softened" / "no grief, no hope. Only witnessing. Only silence"). Sentence openings show good variety; rhythm modulates purposefully. Information density is moderate—many lines serve atmosphere more than plot or character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences ("bowl-shaped hollow," "dissolve into the soil," "a vow," "fragile moment"), creating density without corresponding propulsion—many images repeat thematic claims rather than advance causality. Template cadence appears in the eclipse sequence: "She didn't stand. / Didn't explain. / She simply began..." and later "one by one, others joined" structures. Paraphrase loops: "not for grief, but as an anchor" echoed by "I kept it to remember how small wonders feel before we forget to look for them." Rhythm varies but often prioritizes lyricism over clarity at peak beats. Line-level artifacts deduct −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    High information density with layered images: "diaries, their covers charred into abstract landscapes, their spines split open like ribs after autopsy." Rhythm varies purposefully. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The displaced axis wasn't an event; it was a condition" restates "not celestial, not political, but existential" without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening third ("She was," "She'd seen," "She carried") stacks filter constructions (−0.4). No artifacts touch closure, so accumulation cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"rhythm of waves, of wind, of words that bent reality," "beam slicing the dark like a conductor's baton"—but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "He studied… aligned… timed" in one paragraph, then "He didn't encrypt… he embedded" in the next, creating synonym churn. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions—"cartographer of emotional coastlines," "emotional low tide," "transpose life into a new key"—that dull propulsion. Stock metaphors (sea/home, light/dance) in the final line weaken the landing. Pronoun references and tense remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (audio-tape cassock, indigo as "Assumption's Veil," silence as architecture), but several metaphors strain clarity: "decorates with silence...each pause a column" and "time frayed into filaments of might-have-been" read as ornamental rather than propulsive. Template cadence appears in the question sequences ("If silence is...If stillness..."). Paraphrase loop: the priest's mission is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs ("not exorcism, but illumination" / "to reveal hidden assumptions"). The final third maintains the same elevated register without tightening, reducing momentum. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues; −0.3 for template stems in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is often vivid but suffers from overwriting in peak beats: "chronologically homesick," "upturned hush," "fractal lace," and stacked metaphors obscure momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("She wasn't writing fortunes anymore. She was composing" restates without advancing). Template cadence runs in the middle third (multiple "The [noun] [verb]" openers). Figurative density in high-pressure moments (climax paragraph) layers without clarity or propulsion. Information density is uneven; scaffolding phrases like "Her motivation was clear" tell rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density clogs momentum in high-pressure beats: "not carved, but grown—organic script that shifted like roots seeking water" and "echoes of other selves—some radiant, some ragged, all periodically eternal" stack metaphors without clarifying cause or raising stakes. Paraphrase loops appear ("not to absolve, but to anchor" / "not to consume, but to merge"). Template cadence runs through the confession sequence: "I was afraid." [echo dissolves] / "I ran because…" [echo vanishes]—three identical stems without variation. Synonym churn: "fracture," "splintering," "branching," "recursion" rotate without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 tier and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively (fragment "An audibly muted void" for emphasis; longer lyric cadences in the backward-song sequence). Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. However, figurative language clusters heavily in opening paragraphs ("cedar staves curved like ribs," "rawhide stretched taut over hollow bellies," "filament of hush," "shimmering thread," "layered like sediment") without all images earning causal work—some read decorative. "Each skip became a gasp. / Each scratch, a sob. / Each silence between—not empty, but charged" is effective parallelism but borders template cadence. Minor loops: "hollow shells" echoes "hollow bellies" and "hollow-eyed teens" without reweighting. The verb-tense slip "Elara enthrall" is a proofreading miss.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (each line advances character, world, or pressure). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop detected: "He'd move quietly, laterally" echoes "by progressing laterally" within three paragraphs, and "He didn't hurry. Rushing invited mistakes" restates the same caution without added pressure (−0.2 paraphrase-loop deduction). A few filter-verb stacks appear ("He intuited," "He remembered," "He smiled faintly") but do not cluster in high-pressure beats. "Credibly curious" and "progressing laterally" read slightly template-y as key descriptors. No metaphor muddle or scaffold; clarity and propulsion are strong. Paragraph structure varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy figurative density without pattern-teaching: "silence like an onion," "tea into bone," "stones in a brook," "stitching night into something softer" pile metaphor without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops: "not as a trophy, but as a tactile archive" / "a knot in time's fabric she refused to let unravel" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the grotto nights: "Each night… she laid / She'd begun… she'd whisper / One evening… she laid." Stock therapy-speak: "moral ambiguity," "courage to pause," "holding the tension." Filter-verb stack in peak beat: "she gasped… wasn't repair—it was revelation… proof that morality wasn't fixed." The final paragraph ("something softer, deeper, and finally, mercifully, possible") is rhythmically inert and vague. Artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "She does not speak the stories aloud. She plays them" immediately restates the prior paragraph's claim; "The chronic hush does not vanish. It deepens. It becomes sacred. It becomes the canvas" cycles through restatement. Runs of identical sentence stems ("A high harmonic for… A sliding glissando for… A broken arpeggio—for…") create template cadence across three lines, triggering −0.4 to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("dust motes," "threads unspooling") and elevated register in peak beats ("aching, alive," "fleeting, magnificent") add texture without fresh embodiment, −0.3 for overwriting density. Aggregate: −0.9 in Q7, no artifacts touch closure directly but pervasiveness disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and propulsion steady through the subsumption sequence, with sensory specificity (blue-then-gold flames, rain on stone) anchoring key beats. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without respite ("breathing lung," "honeyed hollows," "silver storm," "cathedral glass," "captured sunset"), creating a thick lyric texture that occasionally obscures momentum. The phrase "affectionate detachment—caring deeply, yet refusing to smother it with ownership" is expository scaffold that defines rather than dramatizes. Minor template cadence: "She gasps... She rises... She walks... She smashes" in the climax leans toward mechanical sequencing. No outright loops, but density without variation dips clarity at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is maintained, but momentum drags under the weight of repetitive phrasing: "He watched...He observed...He returned...He spent...He lingered." Multiple beats open with "Elias" or "He [verb]," creating template cadence across the second half. The phrase "cautious exuberance" appears twice, and "silent contributors" recurs without variation. Figurative language ("tides in teacups," "constellations blinked like distant signal lamps") is competent but occasionally stacked. Paraphrase loops appear: the note's sentiment is summarized, then quoted, then echoed in deliveries. These artifacts dull the final third's propulsion and disallow 9+ globally per the rubric's filter-verb and template-cadence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is dense, but several lines loop conceptually: "not a phantom, but a wiry elder" and "not for thread, but for memory" repeat the same corrective structure; "braided loneliness into bridges" and "stitching themselves into the land's memory" paraphrase the core metaphor. Template cadence in the final montage ("reed-and-glass birds…murals that shifted…paths that glowed") stacks parallel constructions without variation. Figurative language is vivid but appears in nearly every sentence, risking density without escalation. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags in the montage section. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, density without escalation −0.3 = baseline ~6.3.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("echoes pooled like mercury," "vibrations curled like embryos," "petals from frozen blossoms"), but coherence wobbles: echoes are simultaneously born, unborn, and pooled; time is borrowed, sculpted, siphoned, and cushioned without clear physical rules. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She moved quickly," "She pressed on," "She climbed," "She'd press"). Paraphrase loops: "not echoes yet—potential echoes" and "Raw vibrations curled" restate the same idea across adjacent lines. The final paragraph lists outcomes (birdsong, laughter, voices) without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—stalactites as metronomes, mosaic cracks as variables, silence as resonance, emotion curving like light—and while coherent, the relentless metaphor layering in every paragraph risks overwriting. The phrase "emotion curves around absence like light around mass" and similar constructions straddle thesis and image. Line-level clarity holds, with strong verbs and varied syntax, but template stems appear: "It was resonance," "It was then she realized," "She didn't eat it. She cradled it." Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the elevated register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deductions at mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high in the caching sequence and placement beats. Two minor frictions lower the score: (1) "She began to cache" / "She began to leave traces" use identical stems across adjacent moves (−0.4 for template cadence), and (2) "echo" appears three times in close proximity ("sensory echo," "echoing to her alone," "Thematic Echo" effect in "you're not alone" → final notice), risking synonym loop but not quite crossing the threshold (−0.2 caution). The figurative density in peak beats ("pulsed with ghost-sound," "mosaic of lives," "light through stained glass") approaches overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated, avoiding the −0.3 to −0.7 penalty. Clarity and propulsion hold; no paraphrase loops or scaffold obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in places. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't reach for her tools. / She didn't take measurements" repeats the same restraint without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in the storm sequence: "She closed her eyes… She stopped trying… She stopped pretending… She wept." Stock metaphors ("baptism of release," "synapses mid-thought") and elevated diction ("circuitously sincere" used twice as a phrase-tag) clutter peak beats. The figurative density in the glow sequence (veins as filaments, cradle, hammocks) reads purposeful but occasionally mixed (moss "stirred, tendrils lifting" mixes plant and animal). No catastrophic opacity, but cumulative artifact load lowers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies well and imagery is sharp ("silver veins that pooled and snaked," "kelp and the ghosts of barges groaned"), with strong propulsion through most beats. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "She'd spent years chasing ghosts in pigment and brine, only to find the ghost had been trying to find her" directly restates the prior revelation; "Not deeply, not peacefully—but she slept" is followed by "And when she woke" which reiterates the sleep fact. The phrase "haggard awe" and variants of convergence/temporal/spectral accumulate without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the list-structure middle section ("Past and present bled... where drowned villages... and the ghosts of barges...").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries several paraphrase loops: "She hadn't intended to use it. / Not yet. / Not unless..." restates the same hesitation across three fragments; "No," she breathed. "I didn't." / But the cave pearl had" recycles negation. Stock metaphors ("ink spilled in water," "wind testing a door") appear in high-pressure beats without transformation. Template cadence runs appear in the opening third ("not the pilgrim, not the cave pearl, not even...").

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (valve deduction from melody, buoy triangulation from tide logs), but several lines loop conceptually: "She worked...where salt-warped ledgers leaned beside coral-crusted sextants" restates the attic's archive function without added pressure; "mapping grief into geography, turning silence into a kind of harbor" paraphrases the core conceit. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "A widow recalled...Elira matched"; "A shipwright's grandson described...she cross-referenced." The final paragraph's twin explanatory beats ("That's how we learned to sail through silence. That's how we navigated what wasn't there") feel like synonym churn. Opening and closing images are strong, but figurative density in early paragraphs ("salt clinging...like forgotten prayers," "harbor breathe differently") occasionally prioritizes lyricism over propulsion. Applies −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.3 for figurative density in non-peak beats without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("mist clung like regret," "starlight pooled...like liquid mercury," "arrows in the pavement...kneeling, pointing, pleading"). Several phrases loop conceptually: "not with destruction, but invitation" / "not as a tool, but as a key forged from absence" / "not to secrets...to readiness" / "not away, but toward." Template cadence appears in the resolution section with repeated "not X, but Y" constructions. The opening 200+ words front-load backstory before the inciting beat (pressing the punch to the flagstone), dulling momentum. Applying overwriting density (−0.5), loop/template (−0.6), and scaffold penalties yields cumulative deduction of ~−1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and many sentences layer image with action effectively. However, figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph—"salt winds that carried the distant songs," "stars wheeled in silent arcs," "emotional harmonics," "an unheard symphony woven from solitude and awe"—creating density without always advancing pressure. The closing paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops: "not with chisel or spell, but with quiet attention, courageously kind, transcribing the unheard symphony through forgotten patterns" restates the premise rather than propelling it. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("not... but...") and stacked modifiers that dull immediacy. Stock metaphors (heart remembers, moonlight silvered the waves) reduce specificity. Apply −0.8 for figurative saturation and paraphrase loops in the final third, per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings differ. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. "He'd acquired it through intrigue, of course; nothing of value in the multiverse comes without strings, shadows, or silent betrayals" does triple work: backstory, characterization, theme. Overwriting check: figurative language is dense ("walls breathing hues," "magnetic tendrils lashing the void like whips of ionized regret," "shadows peeled from walls and pooled at his feet like liquid ink") but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Deduction for mixed metaphor density in high-pressure beats: "petals of cursed metal unfolding into a gateway stitched from auroras and static" layers vehicles (petals, stitched, auroras, static) that strain coherence (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the piece maintains forward momentum through most beats. However, significant patterns accumulate: repeated "not X, but Y" constructions appear six times, creating template cadence. Synonym loops emerge around fairness/equity/parity and breach/breach/breach. The phrase "deathly vitality" appears three times as label rather than image. Abstract noun stacks ("mathematics," "sacrament," "architect," "presence," "practice") in the final third dull specificity. The mortician paragraph ("He froze, eyes wide—not at the ink, but at the child holding it like a sacrament") exemplifies the pattern. Core clarity remains intact but density decreases under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("epochs pressed like petals," "silence was the loom"), but density suffers from scaffold and synonym loops: "not nostalgia, nor escapism, but collection" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure; "she didn't mind the quiet. Silence was the loom" paraphrases across adjacent beats. The phrase "refract harder, eyes closed, letting the lamp's vibration map the contours" uses "refract" metaphorically in a way that blurs the physical action. Several sentences open with "She" or "The" in runs, creating template cadence in the middle third. No major grammatical errors or pronoun drift, and the final image (lamp flickering approvingly, trees bending) carries clear propulsion. Deduction of −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, avoiding the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the port descriptions and fragment catalog. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he sought texture" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting.") is pattern-taught but borders on synonym churn. The phrase "not to be remembered by names, but by texture" near the end recapitulates earlier assertions. Figurative language is dense but coherent, with no mixed metaphors that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "emotional coordinates," "needle trembling toward meaning," "bracelet of sound," "bruised the horizon." While individually legible, the accumulation in nearly every sentence dilutes impact and slows momentum. Paraphrase loops: "retell/reimagined/revisions" across adjacent paragraphs re-state the same act without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in the opening half: "She wasn't," "She'd spent," "She'd retell" (−0.4). Mixed metaphors: a compass "spins wildly toward emotional coordinates" blurs vehicle and tenor. Closure beats avoid these issues but prior density lowers band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is imagistic and rhythmically controlled in the opening third: "neon lights flickering like tired fireflies," "contracts slither through alleyways like eels." Figurative density eases in the middle beats where action dominates. However, paraphrase loops appear: the dual allegiance concept is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "reorganization isn't sabotage—it's salvage" followed by a list of reorganization tactics feels like synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in the climax: "Privatization stalls. / Not defeated—postponed. / Lira smiles…" reads as rhythmic but mechanical fragments. The phoenix-from-kernels image and "THIS FLOATS TOGETHER" banner vivify the ending, yet the final two paragraphs summarize rather than propel, diluting momentum into thematic recap.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing. Examples: "No one alive could decode it. / That was the point. / It was a farewell sung to an empty auditorium" restates the same idea three ways without added pressure. "She wasn't archiving history. / She was keeping vigil" is a near-duplicate of the earlier shift from documentation to communion. Template cadence appears in the orbit section: "Back in orbit, she'd transmit... They'd likely be buried... But that was okay." Stock metaphors ("throat tight," "shadow stretching long and thin") appear without fresh inflection. The technical detail (sodium metasilicate, etc.) reads as scaffolding rather than voice-filtered expertise. No hard causality breaks, but momentum sags under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in technical beats. Clarity is strong. However, figurative language saturates nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff—"iron bones," "tide of vibration," "alchemy of repair," "kiss with mechanical grace"—creating decorative drift (−0.5). Paraphrase loop: "She didn't rush. / Calm was her compass. Magnetic calm..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "She mended trajectories. She turned fractures..." (−0.4). Cumulative artifact debt across high-pressure beats: −1.1 total.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the search. However, several passages overwrite: "Its dog-ear a silent herald of the next clue" and "a bookmark in the fabric of reality" layer metaphor without added clarity. The phrase "worrying tranquility of isolation settled like dust on forgotten shelves" stacks abstract concepts. Paraphrase appears: "not magic, not machinery, but thermodynamics and tongue" echoes "not a spring, not a glacier, but a convergence point" in structure. The final paragraph compresses three "where" clauses, creating template cadence. Clarity holds, but figurative density in peak beats (the convergence, the spiral) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two paraphrase loops: "not to prevent it, but to rebuild through it, to restore shared balance" restates the same idea across clauses; "Not resurrected. Not restored… But rebalanced—shared between" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: repeated "The + [noun] + [past tense]" openers across four sentences flatten propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template runs. Information density is high, but scaffold phrasing ("simple, absurd, and absolute"; "infinitely patient") appears without dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: the vial-activation sequence stacks metaphors ("thick, velvet quiet," "salt and sorrow and starlight," "burial shroud woven from peace," "chorus of lost voices") without clear imagery, creating figurative muddle exactly where clarity is most needed. Paraphrase loops appear: "gathered hush" is defined, then redefined, then re-invoked across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the final paragraph with repeated "not X, but Y" constructions. The opening sentence buries the subject with a dense participial phrase. Information density is uneven—some lines do multiple jobs, others ("She kicked forward, past schools of silver fish") pad without advancing pressure. Across the closure beat, symbolic convenience (vial shatters "not from pressure, but purpose") and thematic echo ("time didn't run short—it rippled") replace concrete image with authorial summary, dulling the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and vivid, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "Wind gnawed at the jagged reef below, and above, the copperlight repose of dusk draped the tower in amber stillness, as if time itself hesitated to intrude" stacks metaphors (wind gnaws, dusk drapes, time hesitates) without advancing urgency. Paraphrase loop: "He hadn't come for redemption" / "belief wasn't required" / "Let them come"—three statements of defiance that restate stance without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He pried it loose... He climbed... He wedged... He knelt" uses identical stems across four beats. Filter-verb stack: "he knew," "he found," "he felt" within eight lines mid-climb. Stock metaphor: "noose of mistrust." Apply −0.9 for artifact spread and cap 9+ globally. Information density is high in the lattice and lens sequences, but figurative language in most sentences of the climb flattens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    High figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("ashen-veil ghost bride drifted, not as a specter of sorrow, but as a lovingly venomous echo—her touch gentle, her intent sharp as shattered crystal"). Mixed/strained metaphors: "iron-boned ribs" (greenhouses don't have ribs), "greenhouse exhaled—a sound like rusted hinges remembering how to turn" (hinges don't exhale). Template cadence in the middle third: "She had been... He thought... Her vengeance was..." Paraphrase loop: "Her purpose: to repay a debt" / "Each cameo appearance... was a stitch in the unraveling tapestry of her curse" restates mission without added pressure. Applying −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for mixed metaphor, and −0.3 for paraphrase loop = baseline ~5.9. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final fruit description), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Figurative density saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff: "poetic wharf weaver," "overlapping sleepwalking paths," "shipwreck silk and whale-song echoes," "rebellion dressed in lace," "orchid solace." Mixed metaphors appear ("silence had grown too heavy to wear"). Template cadence runs through the closing third ("She would return tomorrow. / And the next night. / And the next."). Paraphrase loops recur: "not to erase the breakage, but to honor its shape, to make the scars part of the story's spine" restates prior content. Information density is low; many lines rephrase mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence ("orchard breathed," "time itself bent like roots," "magic here was shy, bruised by neglect") without pattern-teaching or payoff; the accumulation blurs rather than sharpens pressure (−0.6 for overwriting). Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "Each shovelful…Each artifact…Each detour" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "interrupted journey" restated as "the journey had looped back," "diaspora had ended" echoed as "the diaspora returnee" (−0.2). Momentum sags under weight of modifier stacks and abstract nouns ("purposeful wandering," "spiritual dislocation," "rhythmic reweaving"). Information density is low; many lines rephrase rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level clarity is generally high, but multiple loops and template patterns recur: "careful/carefully" appears three times, "not X, but Y" structures run through five sentences in the final third, and the phrase "carefully inventive" is both prompt-echo and descriptor. Figurative language is dense in descriptive passages ("temple of bygone surface mail," "capsule of time, not data") but remains coherent. The final paragraph stacks three parallel "Not X, but Y" constructions that read as rhetorical scaffolding rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is richly textured with varied sentence rhythm and strong figurative language, but density issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("not for beauty alone, but to listen for unheard stories—whispers buried in the warp of thread, the weft of forgotten stars"), and several beats recycle the stitching action with synonym churn rather than advancing new information. Peak moments—adjacent-layer witness, conspirators' arrival—are summarized rather than shown through concrete action, flattening momentum. The final third stacks summary sentences that reduce line-level propulsion, and metaphoric density in most sentences of high-pressure beats (flame tremor, coup climax) occasionally obscures clarity without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 in Q7 for density and loops).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't read them again. She didn't need to." echoes structure without adding pressure; "not cryptically, not sadly, but with fierce tenderness" is a mechanical toggle. Figurative density is high throughout ("fingers around time," "threads of silver resolve," "seed of stone") without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting. Stock metaphors accumulate: "frozen regret," "drinking the sorrow like rain after drought." Pronoun references and tense remain stable. The loop and density issues prevent entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language saturates most beats without pattern-teaching: "liquid gold," "hesitant ghosts," "needle through torn fabric," "petals unfurling," "braided into something that could bear weight." Template cadence appears in the closing paragraph (repeated "let" anaphora, "not...but" toggles). Paraphrase loops: "She hadn't healed the past—that was never the point. She had let it breathe" restates the same idea. Synonym churn: "unknotting," "unknotted," "knots released" across adjacent lines. The metaphor density and scaffold phrasing dull momentum at the closure beat, though individual images are vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyric and image-rich, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in the projection sequence, and the final paragraph charges prior images effectively. However, overwriting clusters appear: "thick fog," "skeletal trees," "moss-caked stone," "gnarled trunks" in the opening; "amber laughter, cerulean whispers, the blush of apples" stacks metaphor without escalating pressure. Paraphrase loops touch the ending: "not to restore what was lost, but to paint new joys" echoes "not to impress, but to awaken; not to capture, but to release" from two paragraphs prior. Template cadence in the oral-history beats ("She visited… She sat…") flattens momentum. These artifacts lower clarity and propulsion in non-closure passages but do not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often layered within single sentences: "sound became shape. Shape became scent—wet stone, burnt sugar, ozone. Scent became story." This patterned repetition teaches a lyric mode and pays off at closure, so no overwriting penalty applies. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She hadn't come to fix anything. She'd come to be un-fixed" immediately follows "Her motivation had never been preservation, but exchange," restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs in the opening: "not X, but Y" appears five times in quick succession without variation, dulling propulsion (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.6 in Q7. Information density is high when the piece advances; rhythm varies purposefully in the closure sequence. No filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks at closure, so high-band eligibility remains open but the loops and template stems prevent entry above mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Scaffold and loops are pervasive: "candidly cryptic" appears three times as a tonal label; "the gourd rattle seed" is restated in full across multiple paragraphs; "stand guard over her spark" recurs without variation. The phrase "converging chaos" appears in the opening and closing without functional escalation. Figurative density is high throughout ("cathedral of chitinous observation," "visual sonnet," "broadcasting silence in syntax") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty. Template cadence appears in the final third: "Through the children... Through the librarians... Through the rogue scholar." Applying −0.8 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.3 for elevated register drift at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("spiraled chambers echoing with memories," "tide dragging moonlight inland," "orchids erupted from scorched earth"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, alternating long lyrical passages with short declarative beats ("She never slept. But sometimes..."). Minor template patterns appear ("She'd written... She'd found... She called it...") without severe loops. Information density is uneven: vivid images propel some beats, while others paraphrase the same concept (transmuting pain, reef-shadow joy) across adjacent paragraphs. The closure image is clear and propulsive, but mid-section reflection drifts into abstraction ("years folded into each other like petals") that slows momentum without altering present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with images doing double duty (e.g., "skylight woven from spider-silk and starlight" establishes both architecture and tone). However, several phrases edge into purple ornament without advancing pressure: "opal library above clouds," "spiral stair of frozen mist," "slow tides of mercury" cluster in the opening third without causal work. The passage listing other caretakers' mistakes ("shout the names louder...sealed the cracks") feels like scaffolding for theme rather than scene momentum. No loops or serious artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Several beats, however, loop near-synonyms: "not declared, but performed" followed immediately by "literal compositions...meant to be sung aloud" restates the same insight without added pressure. "She documented everything" then "dipping her quill...as if the ink itself remembered" piles two acts of recording in adjacent lines. Minor template cadence in the climax ("A second phrase followed..."; "By the third movement...") and elevated metaphor density ("dust fell like snow," "prismatic shards like scattered promises") in the final third slightly dull propulsion. No outright artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy figurative density without functional payoff: "cicada wings," "tuning fork struck against grief," "equations disguised as poetry, blueprints folded into lullabies" stack metaphors that poeticize rather than clarify. Paraphrase loops abound—paragraph 4 ("motivation was not glory… but to harmonize") and paragraph 16 ("encrypted compassion was strongest… etched in erosion") restate the premise without advancing it. Template cadence in the mid-section: "She [verb], [gerund]" runs across multiple beats. The final two paragraphs summarize future actions in list form, flattening momentum. Apply −1.2 for density, loops, and scaffold touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high, but figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "bruised clouds," "miniature nebula," "cracked open Elara's ribs like a music box." Mixed metaphors appear ("bloomed with the withering beauty"), and template cadence runs through the middle third ("She placed... then on a pigeon's breastplate, then on the spine"). Paraphrase loops: the "paper trails" concept is restated across paragraphs without added pressure. The final third clears somewhat, but the density penalty and metaphor muddle in peak beats (meteorite placement, Argent's flight) lower the score. Clarity holds, but propulsion drags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "edges bleeding rainbow mist," "sound folded into itself," "distance could protect or imprison," "grief absorbed into cellulose, fossilized." Paraphrase loops appear: "thresholds weren't merely doors—they were echoes of decisions unmade" is immediately followed by abstract restatement of the same idea across multiple sentences. Template cadence runs in the backstory exposition ("He'd known then—the maze wasn't meant to confuse, but to reveal. Each turn forced a choice…"). Register drifts into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("sacredness had geometry," "surrender") that clashes with the concrete grain-reading premise. The logbook entries ("Turbulence at 8,000 ft—felt like regret with teeth") are vivid but do not propel the present scene. Artifacts cluster in the final third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose deploys rich figurative language throughout: "barnacle sighs," "living lanterns," "comets returning to their orbits." In the firefly sequence (peak beat), nearly every sentence carries metaphor without clear escalation of pressure, creating density without propulsion. Template cadence appears in paragraph structure: "She [verb]" openings recur across six paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "no longer lonely" / "no longer empty," "not haunted, but inhabited" / "shadows no longer empty but threaded."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("laughter echoing like bubbles popping against stalactites") but appears in nearly every sentence, occasionally muddling clarity: "cheerful gloom, the paradox she wore like a second skin" stacks abstractions without concrete anchor. Paraphrase loops appear: "The missing pieces weren't lost. They were given away. Given willingly, joyfully…" restates across three beats. Template cadence is present in repetitive "She [verb]" openers. Artifact penalties apply for density and loop presence, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "liminal stage between acts where time stretched like saltwater taffy," "phosphorescence in midnight surf," "cathedral: salt-scented, starlit, alive with the echoes of transformed moments." Figurative density obscures rather than sharpens momentum. Template cadence runs: "He didn't... He waited... He tossed... He recited... He never touched it." Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "He needed only the space between acts... to remind the world that wonder isn't rare" repeats the opening's "liminal stage" frame without added pressure. The bishop description is repeated across multiple beats without evolving function. Apply −0.8 for density + loops; −0.3 for template stems touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout, often appearing in consecutive sentences without clear pattern-teaching or payoff: "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs," "vessel launching verses into the void," "architecture of her scars." This creates textural richness but also reduces clarity and momentum, especially in high-pressure beats where the dance itself is described abstractly. Paraphrase loops appear ("not with reflected light but with stored resonance—a captured echo") and template cadence recurs ("each step was choreography, each sway a stanza"). These artifacts cluster across the piece, triggering cumulative deductions of approximately −1.2 and disallowing 9+ globally. Stock metaphor strings (tide, vessel, verse, glyph) and elevated diction ("obsidian grace," "velvet hush") occasionally feel generic rather than particular to this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the stone drop, longer meditative sentences elsewhere) and information density is high. However, a cluster of figurative language in the first half ("study in gradients," "breath held too long," "scattered coins," "ghost-map") verges on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase appears ("not to escape the mundane, but to consecrate it" echoes earlier phrasing). The prism-handling and widow's window beat are propulsive, but the final paragraph's "compass points" metaphor feels decorative rather than necessary. No major loops or scaffold, but density enforcement would tighten the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "the slow dance of celestial bodies," "bargained innocence," "fault lines where grief had settled," "alchemy of ache," "hard softness" cluster figurative language across nearly every paragraph without pattern-taught payoff. Mixed metaphor in "fractures had let some of the burden breathe" (fractures as relief mechanism). Template cadence appears in the final third: "He didn't look back. He knew the path would remember for him. And in that knowing..." Paraphrase loops: "not lost, not restored, but honored" echoes "not to erase it, but to let others know." The piece sacrifices propulsion for lyric density, and the closing five paragraphs restate the theme without advancing situation. Filter-verb stack: "feeling its coolness seep," "knew the path would remember," "found something close to peace."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "hope had different densities," "despair's entropy," "timelines brushed against each other like silk scarves." Many images are vivid (bioluminescent anemones, Fibonacci kelp-strands) but the prose rarely breathes—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstraction. Template cadence appears: "She began again… She watched it vanish… She placed it… She simply noted." Paraphrase loops: "not to escape, but to revitalize—not herself, but the equations" and "not with longing, but with lucid curiosity." These patterns dull momentum in peak beats and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density in the diary fragments. However, several beats exhibit figurative density without clear payoff: "curled at the edges like a sleeping serpent," "curled like unborn birds," and "sharp as a scalpel" in close succession create decorative texture rather than propulsion. The phrase "legacy's burden" appears three times, twice in the final third, with the penultimate use feeling thesis-like rather than dramatized. Minor scaffold appears in "She approached, knelt again" (echoing an earlier kneel) and "gently, as though cradling a wound" (explanatory simile). No loops obscure causality, but the cumulative effect slightly dulls momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("trembling halos," "silent pact with gravity and light," "hollow between her ribs where the borrowed heartbeat echoed") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "Not with wind—the air was still" / "Not with wind, not with magic, but with release" / "not with smoke or spell, but with the quiet grace" recycles negation structure across closure beats (−0.4). The opening anchors voice, but scaffold phrases ("One by one," "This was her canvas") stall momentum. Metaphors often contradict: borrowed heartbeat "echoed" in a "hollow between her ribs" mixes acoustics with anatomy implausibly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (each line advances ritual preparation or thematic weight). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries figurative or elevated diction ("shield and scripture," "graveyard of ideals," "wound," "ghost," "cosmic witness") without teaching a pattern or creating lyric breath. Mixed metaphors appear: "altar" and "gods turned away" clash with the meteorite-ink science. The final third eases slightly but retains dense metaphor ("gravity they could not name," "mosaic of consent"). Paraphrase loops: lines 11–12 restate resolve-building without added pressure. Template cadence in the writing sequence (lines 14–16) stacks "she wrote" stems. These artifacts dull momentum in peak beats. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence + loops, and −0.3 for presence in closure third (final paragraph retains elevated diction that slightly obscures the image). Total: baseline 7.3 − 1.1 = 6.2.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally vivid ("salt crunching like shattered glass," "sky bruised purple"). Information density is high in the opening and ritual sequence. However, the piece exhibits repeated template stems ("He didn't X. He Y.") and paraphrase loops—"not in museums, not in labs" / "not from quake or storm" / "not life. Not justice. But echo." This patterned parallelism becomes mechanical rather than purposeful by the third iteration. The backstory block recounting his crusade and the map's provenance slows momentum mid-scene. Stock metaphors ("tears he never shed in boardrooms," "ghost of a bird's song") and elevated diction ("fractured grace," "hollow melody") cluster in the final third without fresh specificity. Clarity remains intact, but the loops and filter verbs ("he let it," "he didn't move") stack noticeably in the resonance beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is high across most sentences without pattern-teaching: "breath curling like script," "chandelier of frozen tears," "threads coiled like sleeping serpents," "furnace of her refusal," "bodily poetic grace turning labor into liturgy." Mixed metaphors appear ("bodily poetic map," "mantle" of serenity, "braided into fabric"). Template-cadence runs in the thread-sequence ("A thread snapped… Another thread yielded…"). Stock phrases: "alarming serenity was her mantle," "vista," "homecoming." Paraphrase loops: "not with force, but with patience, not with haste, but with rhythm" recycles structure. Deductions: density −0.7, mixed metaphors −0.5, template cadence −0.4, stock phrases −0.3 = baseline ~4.6; artifacts touch closure paragraph ("braided into the fabric") preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but several passages show template cadence and stock phrase reliance: "He'd learned to listen," "He'd penned wedding vows," "He'd take a popular myth" all open with identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Metaphors are occasionally mixed ("stories burn twice" is vivid; "meteor hush" remains unexplained and tonally incongruous). The phrase "half-lit epiphanies" recurs as a label without dramatized specificity. Paraphrase loops appear in the opening ("not to escape, but to reverse... not of the fight, but of the stories"). Information density is moderate; several sentences ("Tonight, though, he practiced alone, rehearsing beneath...") compress transit effectively, but peak beats lean on summary rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("embers caught in slow wind," "stitched with silences where names used to be"). However, density issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear ("To touch it would be to break the spell, to turn sacrament into souvenir" restates the prior restraint), and several beats recycle the same conceptual claim (ephemerality, solitude, vanishing) without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had learned," "She remembered," "She tied," "She closed," "She rose") flatten propulsion in the middle third. Filter verbs ("seemed to blush," "felt the tug") dull immediacy in a few peak lines.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative language is dense and vivid ("aurora ripple overhead—green, violet, silver—as if the sky itself is threading light") but clusters heavily in descriptive passages, occasionally obscuring propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "not from beyond, but from within" / "not in vaults or scrolls, but in vibration" / "not to escape, but to preserve" recycles syntactic templates. Information density is high in ritual mechanics but scaffolding phrases ("This is preservation," "Others will come") tell rather than trust the image. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; clarity remains intact despite lyric compression. The overwriting doesn't touch closure but reduces mid-section momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is dense ("voices whispering from rusted pipes, children laughing in languages no longer spoken"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not with power, but with release" / "not with triumph, but with kinship"; "the bunker hadn't reclaimed the forest; the bunker had surrendered" / "The storm wasn't a threat—it was punctuation." Template-cadence runs emerge in the vision sequence and final paragraphs (repeated "not X, but Y" constructions across three or more lines), triggering a −0.6 deduction per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains high, but momentum drags slightly under the weight of repeated syntactic frames. Filter-verb density ("placing her palm," "let the storm's rhythm sync") does not reach the ≥3-line stack threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language and elevated diction throughout, creating a lyric texture but reducing propulsion. Multiple sentences in the opening and closing paragraphs stack metaphors ("constellations mapped in silence," "time slowed like syrup," "pulsed like a neutron star") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff tied to the closure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 5 and 8 both assert "empirically ironic" to similar effect; paragraphs 17 and 19 restate his frugality and future return. Sentence stems vary, but information density is low in reflective passages that summarize rather than advance. The overwriting penalty (density, register drift) and loop penalty together justify a score in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "Not peace. / Not rest. / Just absence" mirrors the pattern elsewhere; "Not from the box. / From within." and similar constructions recur without cumulative effect. Template cadence runs appear ("She had tried meditation, mantras, therapists, herbs, fasting, running, screaming into pillows"). The final third contains heavy scaffold: "This was the lesson," "Now it was a relic of surrender," and "It reappeared when needed—not because it was enchanted, but because..." that explain rather than show. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("ink bleeding into water" is clear; "cathedral of instability" is abstract). Combined artifacts and loops in closure beats trigger −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The fog responded, thinning in concentric rings above her, revealing for the first time in centuries the bruised violet sky of true twilight"). However, three issues accumulate: (1) paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("She did not chant. / She did not plead. / She breathed" reads as template cadence without adding pressure), (2) stock metaphors ("eyes like molten mercury," "wings of folded parchment") appear in a high-pressure beat without fresh inflection, and (3) the final paragraph's list-like transitions ("between maker and made, between astronomer's failure and artisan's triumph") feel mechanical rather than propulsive. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure sequence, triggering a −0.8 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong verbs. Information density is high in the vow-gathering beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't believe in redemption; she believed in repair" followed immediately by "Gears could be cleaned, lenses polished, vows rewoven" restates the same idea. "Endearingly feisty" is repeated twice with near-identical phrasing ("endearingly feisty, stubborn as a root" / "Endearingly feisty, indeed"), creating synonym churn. Template cadence in the opening third ("She pulled...," "She'd come...," "Her hands...") stacks similar stems. These artifacts apply −0.6 cumulatively in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentence contrasts with short ones during the bathroom beat. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "tuning fork left ringing," "origami traps," "second skeleton." Minor overwriting in the phrase "brightened disquiet clinging to her like static" immediately followed by "brightened disquiet settling into her marrow"—near-synonym loop that slightly dulls momentum. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the double use of "brightened disquiet" and slight repetition of "simply complicated" across beats applies a modest −0.3 deduction for paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The library of unlearned lessons doesn't hide—it waits to be misread" followed immediately by Kael restating the concept. Template cadence runs in the opening: "She had come... she knew... Her fingers... Tucked under her arm..." Each paragraph opens with similar pronoun + action stems. Stock metaphors ("semantic blooms," "verb roots") cluster without fresh vehicle logic. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the climax negotiation) obscures rather than sharpens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and several images land with precision: "vines thick with petals shaped like letters," "names dangled from branches like fruit." Information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (setting and interiority). However, the piece carries noticeable template cadence in the opening third: repeated "not X, not Y, but Z" constructions and parallel noun phrases ("ticket booths choked," "fortune-teller tents where cards still lay") that read as patterned rather than voice-organic. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "ship groaned like a dying beast," "ivy through stone." The phrase "solace unkindled—a peace not yet lit" is explanatory scaffolding that dulls the concept's charge. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift, and the final paragraph breathes with varied rhythm. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor risk in "narrative threads...woven...like ivy through stone" (threads and ivy don't quite align).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and controlled with varied sentence rhythm and vivid sensory detail. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops accumulate: "She didn't pause. Her warmth was in her patience; her method, in her precision" restates the attribute label without adding pressure. "It hadn't vanished because it was wrong. It had vanished because it was no longer needed" is explanation rather than dramatized consequence. Template cadence: "She studied... She began... She merged... She stepped back" across four paragraphs flattens propulsion. The final ledger entry over-explains theme. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality, so penalties remain in Q7 (−0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template stems, total −1.0).

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or action. Rhythm varies purposefully, though some constructions lean on parallel negation ("not as a refugee but as a seeker," "not silence… but balanced," "not in fear, but in recognition") creating a template cadence across emotional peaks. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the caves… now, they screamed" restates the opening dissonance, and "her work here was done" + "she turned toward the next cavern" recycles the closure beat. Figurative language is dense—"storms incarnate," "lunar glow," "dawn mist"—without always serving propulsion. Clarity is maintained, but momentum sags under decorative weight in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled but repetitive: template stems ("She had come," "She believed," "She saw," "She knew," "She understood") and the "not X, but Y" construction create a predictable cadence across the piece. Information density is high in the vision sequence (scholar's manuscript → soldier's pacifism → child's laughter chain), but the opening and closing paragraphs over-rely on lyric stock metaphors ("stubborn weed-rooted optimism," "frozen tear," "refracted light and remembered grace"). No paraphrase loops or causality breaks touch closure. Minor filter-verb stack in the vision beat ("saw how... saw herself") dulls immediacy but does not obscure the turn. Proofreading is clean; no continuity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting that dulls propulsion: "drowsing beast," "memory pooled and trembling," "fossils of feeling," "tapestries no eye would see," "saturation," "chiming like frozen bells." Mixed vehicles appear ("memory pressed into stone like fossils," "whispers in crystal," "shadow-length studied"). Paraphrase loops recur: "not to record facts, but to conjecture" / "not to preserve, but to resurrect"; "preemptively nostalgic" appears three times without variation. Template cadence ("She measured," "She conjectured," "She smiled," "She walked") stacks across the final third. Apply −1.2 for density, coherence, and loop debt in Q7; additional −0.5 for artifacts touching the closure beat (final paragraph). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor ("like overripe fruit," "like slow-burning fuses," "like syrup")—creating pattern fatigue rather than selective charge. In the climax paragraph, stacked metaphors ("constellation waiting to be named," "struck match in heaven's hearth") blur clarity. Template cadence appears: "She [verb]" openers recur across paragraphs without variation. Paraphrase loops: "filter everything through ambient awareness" (paragraph 7) is restated in paragraph 19. Artifice touches the closure beat, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong sensory anchors (dripping stalactites, scuttling crabs, wind hum). Information density is high in description but thins during reflection. Template cadence appears in the threshold-image sequence ("a child's hand releasing... a widow placing... a student closing"), which reads list-like rather than urgent. The phrase "warmly observant" is repeated label-only without embodiment. Minor loops: "transition periods" echoes "transition period" without advancing meaning; "not for revelation, but for resonance" / "not with judgment, not with pleading" deploy parallel structure without causal linkage. The figurative load is heavy but mostly coherent; "memory shards" and "emerald curve" are vivid, though "gravitas" and "liminal" tilt abstract. No clarity breaks at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"gravity inverted," "silence was wild, abundant, nourishing," "clouds curled like sleeping lions"—and while individual images are vivid, the relentless metaphoric layering in nearly every sentence during the climax risks ornamental overwriting without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "They would not return unchanged" followed immediately by "When gravity snapped back...they let go—not of the doll, but of the fear" restates transformation without advancing it. Template cadence is present in the three-part silence sequence ("First:... Then:... Next:...") but serves rhythmic purpose. Line-level clarity holds, though the sheer density of gilded language ("honeyed air," "velvet echo," "crystalline quiet that dissolved...like spun sugar") dulls propulsion at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (storm glass as emotional barometer, fractured sky shards, inverted waterfall mist), but several beats layer metaphor without advancing pressure: "sky was a vaulting hush" followed by "lingering resonance of a distant train whistle that had faded into the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" loops the concept. Paraphrase appears: "He didn't speak" / "Still, he said nothing" / "No farewells were needed; the silence between them was already a conversation." Template cadence runs through the storm-glass progression without varying syntax. "Fluidly logical" recurs as descriptor without embodied cost on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and often mixed: "roots entwined with forgotten conduits" adjacent to "bioluminescent cores," "nano-filaments" next to "aesthetic programming," "solidified memory" as both substance and metaphor. Template cadence appears in the second half: "She moved… She paused… She did so… She moved… She descended… She sat… She chose… She turned." Paraphrase loops: "not of flesh, but of memory" echoes "not stone, not steel, but solidified memory"; "not grand, not gilded, but simple" repeats the negation pattern. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the walk toward the city. Information density is uneven—long descriptive passages stall momentum before key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff: "breath shallow," "cold curve," "sanctuary exhaled dust," "threshold shimmered—not with magic, but with memory." Mixed metaphors appear: scars "pulse" and become threads to "weave," while breath "stirs ash" and simultaneously "coaxes wicks to remember flame." Paraphrase loops recur: "she burns bridges carefully" appears three times with slight variation. Template cadence: "She did not knock. / She did not flinch. / She does not bring light. / She does not look back." Overwriting in high-pressure beats (threshold dissolution, final step) obscures causal linkage and dulls the closure image. Register drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("curriculum of suffocation," "permission to fumble") that clashes with the lyric voice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: "bioluminescent mushroom farm pulsed with soft cerulean and violet halos, each cap a lantern breathing" front-loads figurative density, and the convergence beat stacks metaphors ("Shadows stitched themselves into seams," "dripped liquid potential," "smelling of ozone and old libraries"). Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't resist. She channeled it" restates without advancing. Template cadence in the opening ("Her hands, once trained... now coaxed," "not of buildings, but of belief") and synonym churn ("glitchy," "jittering," "quantum-marketing bot") reduce propulsion. The artifacts touch the closure beat ("lattice of pure, resonant clarity"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense and figurative throughout, with high information load but uneven momentum. Multiple sentences in the opening third stack metaphors without clear propulsion ("the only language the dead still answered"; "invisible architecture of consequence"; "bridge of intuition—a living lattice of memory and resonance"). The cylinder revelation beat suffers from paraphrase loops: "not from shock, but from recognition" followed by "The voice was her mother's. And the child—the swapped child—was her." Template cadence appears in the coastal-training passage (repeated "she had learned" / "she could feel" stems). Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but the ornamental density in non-peak beats slows momentum without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    Syntax varies and individual images are striking ("nectar reversed its flow," "frost and flame entwined"). However, several beats loop conceptually: "not to bind, but to balance," "not to receive, but to offer," "not in a cage, not in a spell, but in the curvature…" and similar antithetical pairs recur across adjacent paragraphs, creating a template cadence. The final third contains multiple paraphrase loops ("He had done it. He had captured…"; "not the dawn of a new day, but the dawn of a new grammar"). Figurative density is high but mixed metaphors appear ("roots rose like questioning fingers" immediately after "glass bent like breath").

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong concrete detail. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "never mentioned but always present" echoes "silent ache"; "not a name, not a date, but" repeats structure; "dust, she'd learned, was never random" is followed by three restatements of the same insight. Template cadence appears in the artifact list (paragraph 27): "the button, the handprints, a crayon drawing...a birthday card." The phrase "examined unknown" appears twice as thematic shorthand. The "quiet declarations of belonging" (paragraph 36) edges toward elevated abstraction. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs that dull density without touching closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the hatch-and-rewiring sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "revised histories… restorations… Truths the regime had buried" recycles the same concept across adjacent paragraphs. "She didn't run. She sat cross-legged" and "She was already gone—vanished into the lagoon's glow" both describe exits, creating mild redundancy. Template cadence in the middle third: "She slipped… She'd spent… She waited…" uses identical stems across four consecutive paragraphs. Purple flourishes ("auric fire," "liquid mirrors") cluster without clear payoff. No clarity breaks, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without meaningful pattern variation, creating density overload: "slipped through negative space, curling like smoke," "swirling like ink in milk," "motes that dissolved," "reluctant curls." While individually legible, the accumulation flattens momentum during what should be high-pressure beats (the prophecy's resistance, the prism's shattering). Paraphrase loops appear ("not with volume, but with gravity" / "not as sound, but as pressure"; "Not fire or flood, but a slow unspooling"). Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("No fanfare...No crowd...Only the quiet return") signals scaffold. Apply −0.8 for density + loops, with artifacts touching the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "cathedral of petrified roots," "silence thicker than fog," "stitching memory into matter," "liturgy," "harmonized"—mixed metaphors (roots/cathedral, stitching/loom, arbor exhaling/speaking) muddle clarity. Paraphrase loops cluster: "not mere cataloging; it was communion" / "not just speaking through leaves" / "not a ghost, not a god" repeat negation-plus-correction stems. Scaffold sentences abound ("She understood then," "From that day," "And so she walked," "From then on"), and the final paragraph summarizes rather than shows the transformation. Template cadence and synonym churn ("mossy delight" twice, "transformed always" as title-drop) touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties per the artifact pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and sensory-rich, with strong figurative language ("vines swallowed iron frames like green teeth"). However, density issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear ("he'd chosen to vanish, to live beneath the world" echoes the same idea across clauses), and some beats lean decorative without advancing pressure (the cinnamon-and-memory mushrooms, the dew mimicking starlight). Template cadence surfaces in the middle section: "He found... He closed... He began... He slept... He spoke." The compass description recurs with synonym variation (pulsed, hummed, trembled, flared) without escalating function. Line-level clarity is strong, but scaffold and ornamental texture slow momentum in non-closure beats, triggering baseline artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is ambitious but unevenly executed. Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "factually mystical, rooted in the alchemy of emotional truth and cosmic alignment" and "luminous regret: the kind that does not drown, but illuminates" stack metaphors and elevate diction beyond the POV's plausible lexicon mid-ritual. Paraphrase loops appear: the coin's cracking is described three times in adjacent paragraphs ("began to crack," "cracks...widened," "shattered") without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She did not stop. Instead, she leaned closer..."; "She was not fixing the coin. She was letting it break...") flatten rhythm. Several stock phrases ("weeping onto cold iron floors," "roaring with molten ambition") dilute specificity. Information density is high in the ritual sequence, but figurative muddle and register drift obscure rather than clarify at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in most sentences ("sound bent and memory pooled like mercury," "throat tight with luminous ache," "bleeding the same color"), creating density without propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops: "She did not collect to hoard. / She collected to integrate" restates purpose without added pressure; "They did not speak. / They confessed" is a synonym toggle. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She did not flinch. / … She did not speak. / … She did not collect"). The closure beat itself—"still warm, still remembering—and smiled"—is clean, limiting the total deduction, but artifacts touch multiple paragraphs and dull momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout: "slow tide pulling back from a shore of needles," "liquid twilight," "equations solving themselves." This density is sustained into high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "I braced myself," "I braced again," "I braced one final time" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "Not the arithmetic of forgiveness, nor the calculus of absolution, but…" and similar constructions create rhythmic monotony. Mixed metaphors: "violet flame peeling back like pages" conflates combustion and paper. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the market and lens-transaction beats. However, the piece exhibits overwriting in figurative clusters: "truths that shimmer elusively tangible, like heat haze over desert stone" followed by "stories folded into origami birds, each chirping forgotten dialects" within two sentences; "edges sharp as regret, its center swirling with captured twilight." Mixed metaphors appear ("grief… calcified into silence," then "unfasten the knot in my client's soul"). The final third accumulates summary and theme statements ("not as tragedies, but as living continuums"; "truth isn't shouted") that reduce propulsion. Template cadence in the closing lines ("Between childhood and now, I've learned") and paraphrase loops ("not by force, but by revealing"; "not as victims, but as architects") trigger modest line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but overwriting clusters appear in high-density passages: "disturbances in dust, as silences where laughter used to live" stacks metaphors without clear causality; "the ghost of glitter" and "lint, ash" feel ornamental. Paraphrase loops surface: "ghosts don't haunt places; they haunt neglect" is immediately followed by "this ticket office...was thick with it," restating rather than advancing. Template cadence runs in mid-section ("He didn't move...He turned...He lowered...He carefully removed") reduce propulsion. Some filter verbs ("he'd learned," "he'd seen") are voice-motivated, but their frequency dulls immediacy in a few beats. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language is dense ("time pooled in corners like spilled ink," "glass petals shattered without sound"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had expected this. Destabilization was the price of compression" restates the prior beat without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("Another frost would come. Another pattern. Another rupture. Another eternity to compress") flatten momentum at the closure beat. Stock metaphors ("dawn bled through cloud gaps," "heavy as a dying star") and elevated diction in most sentences create density without always advancing story. Mixed metaphor: "sea of clouds" "churned violently, reflecting the library's inner chaos in roiling vortices" blurs the vehicle. High information density in many lines, but the closure image is dulled by the template repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, with many sentences doing double duty (e.g., the opening line establishes character, setting, and tone). However, several figurative stacks appear in close proximity—"ribbons of visible time, violet and gold currents flowing like liquid memory"—without pattern-teaching, and the haiku insertions, while thematically motivated, interrupt momentum in the middle third. Template cadence surfaces in repeated clause structures ("not by choice, but by…"; "not to restore, but to reimagine"), and the phrase "academic guilds dismissed him as a romantic" uses generic diction where specificity would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loops: "barricades fell" / "failed his revolution" restate without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "wilted... like a flower folding at dusk," "shadows grew teeth," "light pooled... like spilled mercury," "sunflower toward dawn," "heat haze over summer fields" cluster in adjacent beats, creating decorative layering rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "He wasn't just fixing toys; he was restoring echoes, coaxing memory from metal" is immediately followed by "mending what isn't torn: the invisible fractures in melody." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance... between breakage and song, between rust and revelation" stacks parallelism without advancing the image. The metaphor "shadows... claws scraping glass" then "light... unmaking, reducing them to mere absence" mixes vehicle (claws suggest physical, unmaking suggests ontological) without coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is dense, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament," "inverted constellations, stars that moved to the rhythm of subterranean tides," and "a silence so complete it vibrated in her molars." The opening and psychometry passages stack figurative language without pausing for clarity, triggering the density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "The petrichor here wasn't passive; it clung to her skin, whispered through her pores, rewrote her sense of scale" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. Template cadence: "She dipped… tasted… understood…" across sequential lines. Combined artifacts justify −0.9 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines carry double duty (e.g., "She didn't understand it yet—she was perpetually learning, her mind a tidepool refreshed with each wave"). However, scaffold phrasing recurs: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across the carving sequence, and paraphrase loops appear ("not contracts signed, but gestures repeated, trust layered like sediment" echoes the prior image without advancing pressure). The phrase "turbine-hum reverie" is repeated without reweighting. The ending's summary mode dilutes propulsion, and the line "They had gestures. They had hands. They had trust" borders on rhythmic template.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("shadows deepen into velvet," "dusk bruised the horizon"), but the saturation is high across most sentences, creating a steady wash rather than purposeful peaks. Template cadence appears in the closing sequence: "She still carries... She still kneels... She still reckons" is effective as pattern, but earlier passages loop similar constructions without taught payoff. Paraphrase loop: "not by fame or spectacle, but by the gnawing need" and "not to solve, but to surrender" recycle the same syntactic frame. Information density is moderate; several beats (the three nights sketching, the fourth morning) summarize rather than dramatize. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    Density is high but compromised by pervasive overwriting: stacked metaphors ("veil to press its palm," "throat refusing testimony," "body's unspoken archive"), elevated diction throughout ("retrocognitively," "phosphorescent pulses," "liturgy"), and repetitive syntactic stems ("She stopped trying…instead, she wove"; "She never claimed…She claimed"). Template cadence and filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she knew," "she learned," "she realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: diary pulsing with grief is restated multiple times; truth-in-tension is revisited in three paragraphs. The final third is saturated with abstract claim rather than concrete propulsion, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clear and often vivid ("tattered silk globes swayed," "silence pooled in alleyways"). Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere and character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not storage, but synthesis; not archive, but forge" and "not with hope, but with wary curiosity" are formulaic parallelisms that recur without adding pressure. Template cadence is present: "He rejected," "He called it," "He envisioned," "He sketched," "He didn't preach" across adjacent paragraphs. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("narcotic," "tapestry of discarded dreams," "altars of the ordinary") without pattern-teaching. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in mid-story beats. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and −0.2 for paraphrase loops = −0.8 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lyric and textured with strong figurative control ("dissolved time like sugar in tea," "slow snow"). Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, the middle section accumulates minor scaffold: "It was an accidental prophecy" labels what the prior line demonstrated; "She understood then" and "The response was not words, but warmth" are expository bridges that could be cut. The orchard's hum and petal-drift sequence repeats similar action beats without variation. Template cadence appears in adjacent paragraphs: "She [verb]. [Noun] [verb]." loops through the climax. No major loops touch the closure, but cumulative minor redundancy and filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("felt," "realized," "understood") apply −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful, but density borders on oversaturation: "Not melt—weep"; "Droplets rose upward, defying gravity, gathering into globes that hovered like liquid stars, each holding a flicker of color, a scent, a half-remembered song." Across multiple beats, nearly every line stacks metaphor or lyric clause, risking momentum drag. Paraphrase appears: "not with machines or magic, but with memory, with reverence, with the unbearable lightness of letting go" echoes the later "not by force, but by consent—by honoring what was lost enough to let it return differently." The final paragraph's "wild serenity settled over her—not peace without chaos, but harmony forged in the heart of unraveling" reads as thematic summary rather than image. Information density is high, but propulsion softens under the figurative load, especially in peak beats where leaner syntax would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to pressure beats—"prayer caught mid-breath," "needle stitching heaven to earth," "serpent," "contented cat" stack within a short span. Some phrases border on stock ("ghost of vibrations past"). Information density is uneven; the sensor mechanics are narrated rather than dramatized, creating exposition drag mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sky wept embers," "gravitational sigh," "ink in water"), but several beats stack metaphors without functional pressure ("hymn to impermanence sung in fire and silence," "radiant armor"). Paraphrase loops appear: "He did not mourn... he honored" and "not upward... but downward" repeat structure without advancing momentum. Sentence openings vary, and information density is strong in the comet sequence, but overwriting in reflective passages ("countless farewells," "patient dark," "sweet as breath after crying") slows momentum. No clarity breaks at closure, limiting penalty reach.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative language is dense throughout—"sky bleached of mercy," "ghosts draped in residue of unspoken words," "stones in a dry riverbed"—without clear pattern-teaching or escalation, triggering −0.4 for overwriting that does not intensify at closure. Several lines paraphrase adjacent content: "not by choice but by covenant" followed immediately by "a tangled covenant, frayed by time," and "not with fear, but with reverence" near "she watched them...as an archivist," applying −0.2 for paraphrase loops. Sentence structure varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but the lush texture occasionally slows momentum in the middle third (the ghost-catalog paragraphs). No major scaffold or synonym churn, and the final image is clear. Cumulative deduction: −0.6 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"time's fabric unraveling," "ribs expand," "dust. Like love"—and while most images land cleanly, the accumulation risks slight overwriting in non-peak beats (e.g., "borrowed-time timekeeper" as epithet, "Hollow Net" as brand). Template cadence appears in the final garage-sale listings: three consecutive items with parallel structure ("still steams," "remembers mud," "feel the season"), which reads purposeful but edges toward predictable patterning. Information density is strong; most lines do double work. No paraphrase loops or register drift. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though the lyric register is sustained without tonal modulation under pressure. Minor clarity issue: "Great Recalibration" and "Hollow Net" are introduced without anchoring detail, creating momentary disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences ("Her motivation was never completion—manuscripts, sonnets, endings—but to discover beauty in the incomplete") balanced by shorter action beats ("He doesn't weep. / He stares"). Figurative density is high: "spilled ink," "braille left by the tide," "jubilant ghost." In peak beats (the boy's grief, the kite's launch), metaphor stacks risk slight opacity ("breath of wind," "dancing with the rhythm of its scars"). No loops or scaffold, but template cadence appears in paired short paragraphs ("He doesn't weep. / He stares" / "Not the kite. / You."). Information density is strong; few lines idle. Minor deduction for elevated diction uniformity across narrative and dialogue registers.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high (Page 73 sketch, Page 102 lizard note, copper conducting intention), but the piece carries recurring scaffold and paraphrase loops: "Not with hammers or chisels, but with copper wire" / "not just growth rates... but conversations"; "He didn't curse or rush; he sat cross-legged, gently systematic" / "his movements precise, unhurried, reverent." Template cadence appears in the villagers paragraph ("They expected grief, spectacle, maybe madness. What they found was...") and the final epilogue runs ("Children learned... biologists studied... poets wrote"). Mixed metaphor: "copper... whispered to the trees, urging them into new geometries" (trees don't have ears; geometric compulsion isn't auditory). The closing omniscient summary—"Over the years... a new generation of sparrows"—dilutes the prior image's charge with expository satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with high information density and varied syntax. However, several beats carry figurative overwriting: "bronze quiet" appears four times as a tonal anchor but risks becoming a refrain without evolving meaning; "luminous skeptic" and "artificial pilgrimage" are repeated label-like. The final third accumulates near-paraphrase: "The chemistry was not in the air or the stone, but in the convergence" is restated across multiple lines. Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("She did not look back. The fly amber stayed..."). These artifacts slightly dull momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high but largely coherent: "sun bled orange," "sea retreats, ashamed or spent," "green scream," "sky bruised purple." However, runs of similiar participial constructions ("He knelt, pressing…"; "He opened…spilling…"; "He crushed…releasing…"; "He sang…") create template cadence across the ritual sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "not for show, not for ghosts" and "not vengeance nor absolution, but restoration" recycle syntactic templates. Information density is strong; no major loops obscure causality, but the closure beat's metaphor ("measured not in miles, but in sprouts") tells rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He no longer hunted the dead. He resurrected them" immediately follows paragraphs establishing the same idea. Template cadence in the middle third ("He gathered… shared… led") and stacked metaphoric constructions ("tinted revelations," "wild hush," "resonant echo") occasionally slow momentum. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes, but mid-story beats carry redundant restatements of Bracken's transformation without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Information density is high in sensory passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "temporally stretched" recurs across five sentences without added nuance; "echoed silence" appears three times in similar constructions. The metaphor stack in the opening third (stars as "frozen fire," "held note," "taffy," "teardrop") creates decorative density that slows rather than sharpens the initial pressure. Template cadence is visible in paired "She [verb]" openings across paragraphs 8–10. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third. Deduction: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated diction ("wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods," "mystery rewrite fate's ledger"), obscuring causal clarity under decorative density. Template cadence appears in repeated stems ("He would not conquer... he would amend"; "not fixed... invited"; "not an ending... an overture"). Paraphrase loops are evident: the sky's wrongness is restated multiple times without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("heart drumming a rhythm older than kingdoms") and synonym churn ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon") accumulate. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "silences shaped like breaths," "nomadic penumbra," "trailing edge of displaced light," "benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence." In peak beats (the widow's unbinding, the sovereign's arrival) the metaphorical register does not modulate to concrete action or embodied sensation, obscuring momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "It did not judge… nor pity… it simply mirrored" and "not with darkness, but with a clarity" repeat structure without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the penumbra descriptions ("not shadow, not spirit, but…") across multiple paragraphs. Several sentences restate the interregnum as "not emptiness, but incubation" and "law was suspended but not forgotten" without new detail. Line-level clarity is present but propulsion is dulled by stacked modifiers and synonym cycles. Artifacts touch the closure beat (the sovereign's trembling is described via metaphor rather than embodied action), triggering the high penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is extremely high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstraction ("obsidian wind," "tactile luminescence," "gravity... as sanctuary returning"), obscuring concrete cause-and-effect at peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "not magic... but the shape of home" recurs conceptually across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence: "not [X], but [Y]" structures proliferate (five instances). Information density is uneven—long descriptive passages advance atmosphere but not plot. Sentence rhythm is consistent but does not vary with scene pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final two paragraphs), triggering penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery ("breath-fog," "hollow-cheeked, trembling, eyes glazed with triumph that tasted like ash"). Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not for redemption, but for forgiveness—not from others, but from the ghost she carried inside" and "not by shifting, but by softening" create template cadence. The phrase "woven hush" is repeated without evolving meaning (−0.3). "Not…but" constructions recur four times, flattening syntactic variety. Final image is strong but the penultimate paragraph over-explains the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is lyric and controlled; sentence openings vary, and the dreamscape beat provides textural contrast. Information density is high in the child encounter and final session. However, figurative saturation in nearly every sentence—pale spire pulsing, echoes drowsy, grief-stricken face, burnt sugar mist—approaches pattern without full payoff, and some phrases loop conceptually: "refract a single truth into many" recurs in slight paraphrase. "She didn't know what the spire was—monument, prison, or god" and "not stone or metal beneath, but something like a face" hedge clarity. The child beat is the cleanest: action, song, echo return. Minor template cadence in the ritual-prep paragraph ("She woke knowing... But purity was a lie. Truth lived in refraction. So she prepared...") slightly dulls momentum. No major artifact touches closure, so deductions stay within non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dense figurative language pervades nearly every sentence, creating cumulative overwriting that slows momentum: "acid sea that hissed like a chorus of dying serpents," "time itself were a seamstress mending a rent in reality," "wonder could outweigh wounds." Mixed metaphor in "quilts memories together even when they scream" (quilts don't accommodate screaming). Multiple filter verbs in peak beats ("she felt the memories...rise," "the workshop no longer felt") dull immediacy. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 9–10 both describe pouring lacquer into wounds with similar emotional register. Template cadence: "This one—for X," "For Y," "This last one" structures become mechanical. Information density is high but clarity suffers under decorative layering.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every line ("yawn in the cliffside," "tongue tasting its own edge," "borrowed glass," "elastic and strange," "witness") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering overwriting penalty. Template cadence appears in repeated "she + past-tense verb" openings across multiple paragraphs. Two paraphrase loops: the mirror's function is restated ("no longer reflected… nothing looked quite real"; "cracked mirror… reflecting nothing but dust"), and the promise is echoed redundantly ("whispered at seventeen" / "hidden promise" / "version of herself that still believed").

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid figurative language (cobalt tower, dawn bleeding gold, tide whispering). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, creating density that occasionally slows momentum ("thick as honey," "liquid gold," "jasmine ghosts"). Template cadence in the final paragraph: multiple "This was..." stems reduce propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "whispered thanks into the wind. The wind whispered back" recycles the verb without added pressure. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of lyricism in the closure beat slightly dulls the final image's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout with some vivid constructions ("moon… hanging like a wound," "ears ringing for days") but also mixed vehicles ("weaves not a net, but a tapestry" when both are woven textiles) and synonym loops ("dial tone becomes a dirge; a busy signal, a lullaby" mirrors "Shrines of dial tones" and "Cathedrals of missed connections"). Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" and "Not [X]. [Y]." structures across multiple beats without full pattern payoff (−0.6 in Q7). Several scaffold lines paraphrase without adding pressure: "She doesn't heal. She doesn't fix. She navigates" and "Not resurrection. Resonance." are conceptually redundant. Line-level clarity is mostly maintained, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. However, mid-story reflective passages show mild paraphrase loops ("not for adornment, but because…" / "not profit, nor thrill, but…") and a few filter-verb stacks in the mycelium passage that dull immediacy slightly. The closure beat is clean, with strong propulsion and no figurative muddle. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "bruised clouds" and "fractured grace" trend toward stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not stolen, not implanted, but gently inherited" and the repetition of "the stranger" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the list of collected echoes ("the sigh in a rusted hinge, the ghost-song in warped floorboards, the taste of salt..."). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, especially in the opening third. Sentence openings recycle "He" and "The" stems. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 cumulative in Q7).

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.4)
    Density is high, but multiple paraphrase loops dilate momentum: "the doorway of decisions. / Not metaphorical, not mythical, but real: a threshold humming..." recycles the same assertion. Template cadence appears in successive "he + verb" stems. Mixed metaphor: "cavern's throat" personifies, then "blossoms swaying as if applauding" mixes organic and human gestures without coherence. The final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes: "didn't look back," "noticed," "smiled" tell rather than show the closure moment. Stock phrases ("quiet awe," "smooth stones gleaming like polished promises") blur specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("dusk curling its fingers," "lacy menace," "liquid night"), creating ornamental accumulation in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the dreams weren't prophecy, but invitation" restates the prior firefly guidance without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the pool-vision sequence ("her younger self… her coronation… the moment she signed… the night her child vanished"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("Rule over resonance") that sits outside the queen's lexicon under stress. Apply −0.8 for density and loops, −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "shimmer between heartbeats," "bruised indigo," "moth brushing glass," "liquid starlight." In the closure beat, mixed vehicles accumulate ("pigment I've been missing," "raw material, ready to be shaped") without clear physical grounding, obscuring the concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear: "not as burden, but as bridge" / "not the end of our story" / "the next return, the next revaluation." Template cadence: "Not to apologize. / Not to explain. / But differently." Reading aloud, rhythm varies, but the closure paragraph stacks abstractions that dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally with strong imagistic density ("the wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment," "each ink-stroke a landmark in the wilderness of what-was"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, patterned artifacts appear: paraphrase loops in the past-self encounters ("He doesn't speak, just strums…I want to scream at him" / "He stares at me like I'm the ghost, then vanishes") and repetitive sentence stems in the middle third ("I write about," "I chase," "I roll it tight"). The figurative density remains high without muddling, but the loops and template cadence in the second third penalize Q7 cumulatively by −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the shop-work beats. However, patterned overwriting pervades: nearly every paragraph layers metaphor ("lungs between breaths," "moonlit water," "gravity of implication," "hymn," "monument," "offering") without teaching a motif that pays off distinctly at closure. Template cadence appears in the closing third: "She would listen...She would read...She would humanize...She would map." The final sequence also paraphrases the opening fog-and-miracle premise without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure zone, preventing high-band entry and triggering the cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and sentence openings shift, though several lines deploy stacked modifiers ("sharp but yielding, like a bird's beak parting fog") that approach purple without quite crossing. Minor paraphrase loops: "She did not rush. / She did not flinch." and "The scars were still there. / But now, so was the story." read as intentional parallelism but border on template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance image, emotion, or stakes—but the closing paragraph's thematic summary ("stories do not erase pain—they alchemize it") tells rather than trusts the prior image. No pronoun drift or spatial confusion; clarity remains intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structures and no major loops. Information density is uneven: the opening image ("hush before the orchard's trees…settled like dust over piano keys") is evocative but abstract, delaying concrete action. The phrase "two broken things…humming with the same flawed frequency" serves as a summary rather than a charged image. Minor scaffold appears in repeated sentence stems ("She'd…," "He…"). The scent-device sequence ("golden threads swirling…weaving into shapes") leans ornamental with stacked metaphors that blur immediacy. No deal-breaking artifacts touch closure, but figurative density in mid-beats reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong sentence-level propulsion in early beats. Information density is high. However, several passages accumulate figurative language without adding pressure: "Her name had dissolved centuries ago, shed like skin during the universe's hiccup—a blink between cosmic breaths when causality frayed and memory turned to vapor" stacks metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The phrase "wanderingly exact—never lost, never rushed, always arriving precisely where error became revelation" paraphrases itself within one sentence. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure: "fjord quiet," "erosion of moments," "razor edges," "skin of causality," "visual stutter in the fabric of now," "hollow where a moment used to be." Many lines restate the same thematic content with synonym variation ("erosion of moments" / "space between ticks" / "hollow where a moment used to be"), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Template cadence appears in the enumeration beats ("327, 326, 325… the pistons slowed. The dials flickered..."). The opening and closing are strong, but mid-passage scaffold ("He knew: clocks didn't measure hours. They measured surrender") reads as thesis assertion rather than embedded action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, figurative language is purposeful ("shadows that moved against the wind's direction," "beeping like slot machines"). Clear propulsion through the scrawl discoveries and father's arc. Minor artifacts: "She'd begun noticing" and "She began to traverse" are scaffold phrases that could be cut; "the kind that widens perspectives responsibly" borders on exposition. The phrase "clover melancholy settled over her—not sadness, exactly" is a tell-then-show hedge. Paraphrase loop: "traverse" recurs in similar constructions across three beats without pattern-teaching. No severe muddling, but cumulative minor slips pull the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "Her booth, retrofitted from an abandoned signal station, hummed with rotary dials and patch cables that snaked like veins through rusted conduits" grounds setting, supplies metaphor, and sets tone). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "veins through rusted conduits," "seeds," "fragile root," "echo dissolved into the background hum." One mixed metaphor: "disc's echo" and "looped their emotional residues, not as recordings but as resonances" blur the distinction between sound and metaphor. Template cadence appears in the examples: "A teenager calling... got patched into... A chef misdialing... reached... The operator didn't orchestrate..." (parallel stems across three beats). Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs two and five both describe the disc remembering voices and looping emotional residues. Proofreading is clean; no grammar errors. The "between the hum of streetlamps" refrain is purposeful and charges the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often effective ("sepia tones held sorrow like a vessel"), but pervasive metaphor in nearly every sentence of reflective beats creates drag rather than propulsion—lines do double aesthetic duty without always advancing situation or choice. Paraphrase loops appear: "to preserve the weight of small moments" is restated multiple times across paragraphs with synonym variation but no added pressure. Template cadence: runs of "She wrote…," "She did not…," "The [noun] [verbed]" reduce rhythmic variation. Several stock constructions: "stubborn luminescence," "haunted euphoria," "small eternal weights." Information density is moderate; some lines compress well, others linger for texture without momentum gain. No major clarity breaks, but scaffold and figurative saturation prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (moon rock "cool and cratered," "moth-eaten coat," "eyes red-rimmed"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the final exchange. However, several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She didn't believe in magic, but she believed in symbols—and symbols… could rearrange"; "The rumors weren't true—but they didn't need to be. Truth lived in…"), template-cadence repetition in the exchange sequence, and stock metaphors ("dandelion seeds on a breeze"). Filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("She'd chased," "She set up," "Elara watched") dull immediacy. The final third's thematic declarations ("not because of the rock… But because") edge toward scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives ("She did not flinch. / No notes. / No vibrations.") breaking lyric accumulation at key moments. Information density is high—most lines layer sensory detail with emotional topography. However, figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching: "vowel shaped like gratitude, a consonant forged from courage" and "skin now a parchment not of borrowed words, but of earned songs" pile metaphor on metaphor, occasionally mixing vehicles (parchment/compass/song/trail). Template cadence appears in the closing sequence: "each time more whole, each time more lost, each time more alive" is purposeful parallelism, but earlier beats recycle "she absorbed" and "she let" constructions. One paraphrase loop: the forest "absorbing" her word and then roots beginning to "grow" restates the same idea.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is technically clean with varied syntax and no grammar errors. However, figurative density is high across nearly every sentence without respite or pattern-teaching: "divining rod for forgotten truths," "entropy's cruel editing," "thresher ran on broken gears," "causality hiccup," "gravitational anomaly pulsed," "narrative threads tangling," "emotional mass," "sigil of revision," "membrane," "starlight ink," "dancing with its grammar." In high-pressure beats (paragraph three's editing sequence), metaphor continues unabated, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "unbent... the rigid syntax," "let the rules soften, let the commas dissolve, let the periods become ellipses" restates the same content three ways. Template cadence in paragraph four: "A child's lost balloon... A war dissolved... Each edit" cycles through parallel structures. Deductions: density overwriting −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, totaling −1.1 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "dawn mist softening edges," "fingers curling like petals," "cello's lowest note." Mixed metaphors appear ("spilled mercury" + "fractured by ripples"). Paraphrase loops are present: the second paragraph tells us the camera has no film, then restates "no film, no shutter" in the third. Template cadence runs through the fisherman and girl beats ("He didn't understand… That was the magic" / "She didn't speak. She never had"). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure: "volcanic tenderness," "curator of the unspoken," "throat of the earth," "lullaby of ash and resilience." Paraphrase loops abound—"not by training, but by survival" / "not for chaos, but for revelation" / "not from grief, but recognition"—creating template cadence across the text. The final third stacks metaphors ("embers," "fissure," "mercy flowed," "sang louder") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending; disallow 9+ globally and apply −1.4 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor ("auroras trapped in glass," "mercury under constellations," "petals of frequency unfurling"). Mixed vehicle coherence slips: "liquid light" becomes "tendrils" that "lift" rather than drown, which strains the image. Template cadence appears in the anaphoric "she drummed for" block (five parallel lines) and again in "not to erase…not to silence…but to weave," which reads purposeful but risks mechanical repetition. Information density is strong, though some lines paraphrase ("beautiful, luminous, and utterly suffocating" restates the prior glass-trap metaphor). No major loops or scaffold, but the closure beat's lyricism ("the universe exhaled / she breathed with it") trends stock and dilutes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, discovery, or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph ("didn't flinch—she'd learned," "not to fix cranes or patch hulls, but to navigate") and one paraphrase loop ("whispers travel farther than shouts... Whispers, she knew, echo longer") that restate the same concept without added pressure. The keyhole revelation beat is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("drowned sapphire," "spiralingly calm," "hope's geometry," "liquid silver and refracted moonlight," "moth wings") without pattern-teaching or payoff proportional to frequency; this triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). "Spiralingly calm" recurs as a phrase without evolving stakes. Some lines paraphrase: "She did not speak…silence was her dialect" restates the same content. Template stems appear: "She would crouch…weaving reflections"; "By tilting them…she could sculpt." Propulsion is intermittent; the bridge-memory paragraph stalls momentum mid-scene. Information density is high in closure beats, preventing catastrophic failure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries stacked metaphor or figurative language ("stained-glass windows weeping condensation," "mist swirling around her ankles like liquid cobalt," "futures being quietly rewritten"). Paraphrase loops appear: "cradled the grotto… not with hands, but with intention" followed by "cradled not the grotto now, but the silence" and later "cradling not an object, but a possibility." Sentence openings recycle stems ("She heard… She cradled… She placed… She stepped… She nodded"). The density of decoration obscures momentum rather than advancing it, and the closure beat is dulled by abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries poetic density and varied rhythm, but multiple lines loop or paraphrase: "Not from shore, not from sky, but from the deep" is immediately echoed by "It wasn't sound—it was summons." The vision sequence summarizes three nested revelations ("She saw herself… She saw the pirate… The island surfaced…") in parallel template cadence without propulsion. Figurative language saturates most sentences ("bruised indigo sky," "lover's reproach," "seafoam between her fingers"), and mixed metaphors appear: grief "settles into bone like barnacles" (mineral accretion), then the scrimshaw's ridges "bite into her palm like a lover's reproach" (animate attack + emotional analogy). The final third deploys anaphora ("Not here. Not now. Not while…") that decorates rather than advances the image, triggering −0.6 for template cadence and loop artifacts across the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the whittling-as-erosion motif is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure (opening, mid-story, and final beats recycle "whittling to erode" / "narrating emptiness" / "hollow craft" phrasing). Template cadence: "They'd offered tea, smiled without muscle, and lied" / "They burned the pamphlets... feeding the flames" / "They knew... So they prepared" runs of identical stems appear in the middle third. The figurative density ("ghosts," "sentinels," "counter-rhythm," "armor") is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "shavings curling like ghosts" then later "every shaving" treated as physical remnant without acknowledging the ghost simile's contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction without clear propulsion ("syllables shaped from ancient wind and glacial melt, verses she'd smuggled in dreams"). Paraphrase loops: "boundaries dissolved…boundaries once thought sacred" and "not in worship, but in conversation" echo without adding pressure. Template cadence: repeated "not X, but Y" constructions across the piece (−0.6). Register drift into abstract philosophical phrasing clashes with embodied moment. The final third remains ornamental rather than tightening toward closure (−1.4 total in Q7; artifacts touch closure −1.7 baseline applies).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specificity ("concertina reed tongue," "mugwort behind them in staggered rows"). However, two sentence-stems repeat in the plant-arrangement passage ("He was communicating… He wedged it… He showed her…"), creating template cadence. The phrase "innocently cunning" recurs identically without transformation. Final-third artifacts: "not with paint or flame, but with root and rust, with arrangement and resonance, with bartered awakenings traded not for perfection, but for…" stacks parallelism to near-opacity. These issues collectively trigger −0.6 for patterned artifacts and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "echoes had fossilized into silence," "prism-song," "golden shadows" sustain the synesthetic frame. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Each hue carried a texture: cobalt for longing, amber for comfort, violet for grief" is a list that restates the synesthesia claim three times without adding pressure. The phrase "powerfully gentle" appears twice with identical framing. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("artificial pilgrimage," "sediment holding the bones of forgotten conversations") in high-pressure moments. The final beat's "seeds of texture, of friction, of imperfect, unoptimized, gloriously human resonance" stacks three synonym clusters. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template cadence in the color-texture list, and −0.3 for register drift (total −1.3 under artifact cap). Disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistic, with strong verbs ("burnishing," "wept," "cradle") and concrete nouns (vellum, brass, origami). Several passages approach paraphrase loops: "She believed sorrow could be rerouted, not erased; that grief, properly tended, might sprout unexpected petals" closely echoes "to teach withering to bloom again," and the curtain mechanics are explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she called") stack in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. No single artifact obscures closure, but the cumulative effect reduces density and propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often precise ("onyx-ink," "rain-beaded," "liquid runes") but in several high-pressure beats—the convergence-point discovery, the visitor exchange—metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "algorithms once screamed," "cathedral of collated whispers," "emotional payload," "dormant serpent." These compress clarity rather than sharpening it. Minor paraphrase loop between "shared glances" and "gestures" and between "emotional resonance logged" and "emotional temperature." Sentence openings vary, but rhythm flattens in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems across four consecutive paragraphs. The Cost Proof Test is marginal: the cartomancer's solitary labor and the ledger's weight suggest cost, but no specific sentence in the closure unit makes sacrifice or foreclosure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fireflies," "molten regret," "broken ribs," "pilgrims to a shrine," "embers freed from a dying hearth"), creating lush texture but risking overwriting in consecutive sentences without pattern-teaching or cost payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "not for preservation, but purification" / "not erased, but released" / "not to flee, but to return" recur as syntactic templates. Minor template cadence in the pagoda-description paragraph. Information density is strong; no major clarity breaks. Deductions for figurative saturation and stem repetition in peak beats total approximately −0.9 under the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is lush but mostly legible. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "luminous regret" appears three times, "softly deliberate" twice, and "hope" is invoked repeatedly in adjacent constructions without added pressure. Template cadence in the dream-ripple sequence ("A boy dreaming...A woman dreaming...") reads mechanical. Mixed metaphor: "shadows...blur into ambient gloom" conflates shadow with light-absence in a way that muddies the vehicle. The overwriting in peak beats (discovery, embedding) loads figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying density penalty of −0.5. Closure image is vivid and propulsive, mitigating non-closure drift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and the reconstruction sequence advances character through layered action. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the chameleon's tail "was more than a fragment; it was a metaphor" is restated across three adjacent paragraphs with synonym churn (shedding skin/shedding tails/shedding layers). Template cadence in the planning sequence ("She would draft… she would testify… she would open…") stacks without variation. The line "They were the true sanctuary, hidden beneath the fraud" shifts into summary abstraction where scene pressure would serve better. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid images (ivy "curled around her ankles like worried children," seed "nestled in a cradle of fossilized roots"). Two artifact clusters lower the score: (1) paraphrase loops in the opening ("not pain, but silence—the kind that follows a meteor's passage, a hush stitched with awe and dread" rehearses the same idea twice), and (2) filter-verb stacks in the middle passage ("showed her every wound… every life… every death") flatten immediacy during a pivotal beat. The final paragraph summarizes rather than enacting the transformation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("loneliness pooling in corners of frames," "ache stitched into her ribs like a second skeleton," "lanterns on a river"). While often vivid, the frequency flattens momentum in non-peak beats—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction without respite. Paraphrase appears: "unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates" is restated via "not in vaults, but in motion" two paragraphs later. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "She [verb]" (She closed, She gasped, She saw, She read, She understood, She gathered, She rose, She descended, She smiled, She stepped). Information density is high but propulsion occasionally stalls under ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every paragraph ("echoed like a cathedral," "stitching silver thread through velvet night," "stardust that clung to her soul like pollen"), creating sustained poetic density that risks overwriting in high-pressure beats. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops occur: "not sleep, not stillness, but the kind of surrender" and "not silenced, but released" restate rather than advance. The climax is abstracted ("she saw not stars, but souls") rather than concretely propelled. No major grammar or clarity errors, but the figurative density dulls momentum and accumulates to −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"fractured lullaby," "entropy's tide," "sheet music" seams, "pillar of static"—yet many metaphors float as ornament rather than advancing causality. The second paragraph's triple "not X, but Y" construction ("not fire, not light, but potential"; "not cargo, but silence") reads as template cadence without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "occasionally everywhere" is stated three times across the piece without reweighting, and "dreamless men do not smile" tells what the prior line already showed (shoulders softening). Information density is uneven; the archive tour (oceans, gravity in minor key, children inventing time) stacks vivid images that do not constrain the guard's choice or narrow his search.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent (brass vines, mercury waterfall). Information density is high in the forest sequence. However, template cadence appears in the opening beats ("He'd translocated... this was the third time... each landing grew less graceful") and the final third accumulates near-redundant declarations: "not falling, but floating" followed by "not breaking, but breathing, expanding" and "no longer a stray, but a pioneer." The closure paragraph stacks abstract intensifiers ("wild, the possible, the sacred") that blur rather than sharpen the image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled with strong sensory specificity ("moss-slick railings," "bracken that sighed open and shut"). However, figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats: "leash broke…with a sigh," "star-punch holes in the fabric of the world," "inner constellations," "stitched with starlight." Mixed metaphors appear ("fabric of the world" / "leaking quiet light"). Template cadence emerges in repeated participial constructions and "they + verb" stems. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the accumulation of metaphorical language without dramatized action dulls momentum. Stock phrasing ("half-remembered dreams," "question marks") reduces specificity in places.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and figurative language is dense but coherent ("frozen hymn," "mausoleum of safety's suffocating cost," "frostbitten hope"). Information density is high; each line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting: "seraphically mundane grace," "orchestrating the silence of the place," and the stacked metaphors in the opening paragraph ("frozen hymn," "mausoleum," "suffocating cost") approach decorative density without always earning their freight. No loops or scaffold. Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("footfalls swallowed by centuries of silence," "moving like ink bleeding through parchment"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Books lined the walls like tombstones, each spine a silent sentinel" immediately followed by "she chose none, yet left traces in all" recaps the same beat. Stock metaphors cluster in the opening third ("dust of the ancient temple," "stars burned colder," "hollow echo of justice"). The final paragraph's "absorbed her absence as it had absorbed her presence: without fanfare, without grief, with the quiet grace of stone accepting moss" is lush but stacks three parallel clauses that dilate the closure image without adding new pressure. No major clarity breaks, but the density dips in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (coral skeletons + tidal logs + coordinates in one beat), and concrete nouns anchor each move. The opening ("creaked with each tide, its metal bones groaning") and the tapping refrain ("tap-tap-tap… pause… tap-tap… tap") create textural propulsion. Two substantive issues lower the score: synonym loops around "paths" ("vanished," "disappeared," "submerged") across adjacent paragraphs, and the final teaching montage relies on summary rather than scene, dulling momentum. The phrase "periodically eternal" is poetic but borders on purple without clear denotation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not to escape, but to discover meaning" is restated as "the hollows rebellion had left behind," and "the rebellion hadn't died; it had paused" is echoed in "the rebellion—quiet no longer—began again." Template cadence runs appear in the final third: "She stood. / They stood with her. / The night opened wide." Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (moss against skin, forests before axes) is vivid and mostly coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not by design, not by magic, but by accident" immediately followed by the childhood-fever explanation restates the same content; "not with guns or barricades, but with memory, with myth" echoes the structure without added pressure. Template cadence pervades ("not X, not Y, but Z" appears six times across the piece), flattening propulsion in peak beats. The final paragraph summarizes outcome (children will find them, will ask questions, she will answer) rather than dramatizing discovery, diluting closure immediacy. Minor: "steam curled around it like breath" is apt, but "destiny unchosen is no destiny at all" edges toward aphorism rather than scene-embedded thought.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high in the cypress-freeze beat and the dewdrop-as-pearl morning. Two frictions: (1) "somatic markers" recurs three times with near-identical framing (label + instructional aside), creating a mild template effect; (2) the middle third includes paraphrase loops—"I don't come to escape. I come to witness" directly restates the prior paragraph's shift without adding pressure, and "The drone strike taught me... The arboretum teaches me..." is symmetric summary rather than dramatized contrast. No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language (pearl, frequency, compass, shell cradling sea's memory) is consistent and purposeful, though "frequency I'm finally tuned to receive" borders on mixed metaphor with the earlier tactile pearl. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "luminescent ache of transformation: the kind that comes when bone must break to grow correctly, when silence must swallow sound to birth song" stacks metaphors without grounding in action. Paraphrase loop appears: "She didn't flinch. Pain was the price of coherence" restates her acceptance without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the painting sequence: "She painted her mentor's vanished smile. She painted the Tower mid-collapse... She painted herself..." The abstract register ("perceptually," "metaphysical," "latent possibility") recurs in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Stock phrases: "wind through broken glass," "heart as tuning fork." No scaffold or synonym churn, and information density is high, but figurative muddle touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well, with short declaratives in peak moments ("She stood abruptly") and longer lyric sweeps elsewhere. However, several lines loop or restate: "She worked with serene anger—not rage, not despair, but a quiet, molten fury" is a paraphrase stack. "The ink didn't just vanish; it unraveled" repeats the vanishing concept. Figurative density is high ("taffy," "Rorschach of impermanence," "dirge," "honey," "sigh") without always adding clarity; some metaphors (honey-thick seconds, taffy-stretched time) echo each other. The phrase "silent theater where time bent" is evocative but pushes toward purple without concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance world, character, or pressure. However, several artifacts cluster: "bravely conflicted" appears twice as a phrase-label, "dizzying quiet" recurs without reweighting, and figurative strings accumulate in mid-story beats ("phantom voices murmuring through the stacks," "neural echoes stored in marble columns," "emotional resonance... flooding every terminal") with mixed coherence—how does emotional resonance "flood" a terminal? Register drifts toward abstract institutional language ("limbic systems," "quantum relays") that sits uneasily with the lyric frame. Template cadence appears in the Citizens-awoke / Guards-stormed / They-found sequence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the cumulative figurative density and occasional register mismatch lower the score. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts (label repetition, mixed metaphor, template runs) and −0.3 for register drift, totaling −0.9 within Q7's Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or restate: "She didn't preach. She demonstrated" is a meta-summary of what has already been shown; "violence folded away, not forgotten, but chosen against" is elegant but paraphrases the prior sentence about the knife. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet," "liquid gold," "stubborn memory" cluster without breathing room. Opening and closing lines are strong. No major grammar or sequencing errors, but synonym churn appears in the sandbag-scrap descriptions ("memory, gravity, the hush of descent" vs. "the grit still clinging like stubborn memory").

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and figurative language is patterned (sonic metaphors throughout). However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "maternal fury distilled into pure acoustic wrath" stacks abstractions, and "not to possess, but to pass through" / "not caught. Not captured. But carried" repeat the same negation-then-correction template within two paragraphs (−0.5 for template cadence). Mixed metaphor: "silence became teeth" contradicts the established sonic-floral world logic without setup (−0.4). Line-level clarity suffers slightly under figurative density in the climax, but propulsion remains strong and no loops touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several strong images (telescope as urban microscope, smoke thread stitching sky to earth) and purposeful parallelism ("not for scandal, not for profit, but because..."). However, density suffers from synonym loops ("trembling with half-truths, his silence louder than his words"; "not merely sharp-eyed, but reverently attentive") and template-cadence runs in the opening third. The proof-by-contradiction sequence is efficient, but the final two paragraphs drift into abstract philosophizing ("truth, like gravity," "orbits are not prisons") that summarizes rather than charges. Filter-verb stacks ("watched," "adjusted," "photographed") in the telescope sequence dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("origami paper pressed too hard," "threads of aurora," "thawing ice"). Mixed metaphors appear ("firmware that replays screams as lullabies," "vacuum tubes throbbing with violet light" alongside "meteor hush") without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops: "the cries softened" / "static dissolved into sighs" / "screams unraveled into yawns" repeat the same content. Template cadence runs in the climax: "She sang… The firmware stuttered. The cries softened. She tethered…" Figurative density in peak beats (−0.6), mixed metaphors (−0.5), loops (−0.4), and register drift into elevated diction clash with the POV's practical task (−0.4). Artifacts touch closure (−1.7 total deduction applied). Final third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates purposefully. Clarity is generally high, with no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not with words, not with chalk, but through the patterns" recurs in concept as "meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through the patterns"; "not fear, not dread, but the soft, lavender-tinted discomfort" and "not peace, not joy, but recognition" use identical "not X, not Y, but Z" scaffolding. The final third contains template cadence ("she passed," "she paused," "she drew," "she sat") and stock openers ("Today, she would," "Outside, the world," "That night, she"). Figurative density is high but several metaphors mix registers: "taste metallic" (synesthetic), "clanging without cadence" (auditory), "viscous with withheld confession" (tactile abstraction). Apply baseline artifact penalty of −0.6 and an additional −0.3 for paraphrase loops, totaling −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in early beats ("ash clung...like powdered grief"). However, thematic articulation in the second half relies on parallel constructions and label-stacking: "It is cold to the cruel, warm to the broken. It sees the wound and does not look away—it names the wound, and then names the healer." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (mercy definitions repeat across three beats). The renaming list (beggar/keeper, orphan/seed, ruin/cradle) is purposeful but template-like. No major clarity breaks, yet density tilts toward ornament in the manifesto section.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is lyric and imagistic with strong rhythmic control: "her voice turned grief into lilac mist, joy into golden chimes that clung to skin like perfume." Some paraphrase loops appear: "fractured timelines" and "time's fraying edges" restate the same concept without added pressure; "thread" recurs without functional variation. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. The closure beat avoids loops, preserving its charge. Template cadence in the three-echo sequence ("From one fissure… From another…") is brief and purposeful, not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful (frozen lightning, radio signal underwater, afterimages that lingered like promises). Paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't afraid of the voices; afraid they were real" / "didn't break connections—revealed how artificial they'd been" restate the same inversion twice. Template stems recur ("She closed her eyes... She followed it... She picked up..."). The final third stacks elevated metaphors ("starfield of shared memory," "somatic glyphs," "willowglass hope") without varying cadence, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory anchors and varied syntax. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not to observe, but to participate; not to record, but to respond" and "not from her body, but from the cave itself" employ parallel negation constructions that approach template cadence. Filter verbs ("she called them," "she did not mourn") are voice-motivated but cluster in reflective beats. No major loops obscure causality or closure, so deductions remain modest. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    Information density is high and figurative language is purposeful (sand as truth, buttons as choice archaeology), but template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems: "She [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs without variation, and several lines paraphrase adjacent content (e.g., multiple restatements of prophecy-as-assembly). The opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate strong rhythmic control, and the piece avoids filter-verb stacks. Proofreading is clean. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("prophecy was written in lightning" / "stitched in silence") rather than advancing through image, and "quietly inspired" appears as a label across multiple beats without embodied cost in each instance (−0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops in non-closure beats).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and the prose often does double duty (e.g., "her boots crunching through the last brittle crust of winter, each step a defiance"). However, figurative density is high throughout, especially in the final third ("silver hush," "ghost of justice," "scattered pages of an unread book"), which risks overwriting. Some paraphrase loops: "unused courage" recurs multiple times without fresh pressure, and "silver hush" appears twice in close proximity. The final image is vivid but the metaphor stack ("ash," "compost," "seeds," "bloom") borders on redundancy. Line-level clarity remains intact, but the ornamental load in peak beats lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or abstract diction ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity," "percolate truth")—without a taught pattern that pays off at closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to simplify, but to clarify" / "not a vow to fix, but to reveal; not to erase, but to refine" restate the same concept without added pressure. Stock phrases recur: "not from cold, but resonance" / "not from fear, but recognition" / "not as a destination, but as a threshold." These template cadences and synonym chains accumulate across the text, particularly in the final third, applying cumulative artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("scorched and skeletal," "liquid regret," "resin undisturbed," "palimpsest of summers") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff discipline; in peak beats this crowds rather than sharpens. Paraphrase loops appear: "not through strength, but surrender — it had stopped fighting entropy, stopped demanding continuity" restates the same idea across clauses. Template stems recur: "She set…She closed…She poured…She began…She understood…She did not…She smiled…She left…She walked." Information density is strong when grounded but suffers when metaphor stacks. No causality breaks, but momentum drags slightly in the middle reflective block.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and mostly clear, with vivid figurative language ("spilled mercury," "crimson sigh"). However, density of metaphor and elevated diction approaches overwriting in several beats: "quivering hush," "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability," and "seeding of resilience where fragility had taken root" stack near each other without sufficient plain-action breathing room. Paraphrase loop appears in paragraphs 19–20 (protected vulnerability restated twice). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; syntax varies purposefully. Closure image is clear, but mid-story figurative density and one loop trigger cumulative deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense (library as leviathan, skin as refracted memory, shadow trembling toward extinction's grave). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or elevated diction without respite, flattening urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "not vanity, but survival" / "not gift, but burden" / "not mourner, but midwife" becomes a template cadence across multiple paragraphs. The flood sequence gains clarity but then the ending returns to stacked modifiers ("ozone and possibility—the metallic tang of worlds being rewritten"). Information density is high but momentum drags under the figurative load. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain here. Deduct −1.0 for template cadence, overwriting density in non-peak beats, and paraphrase loops; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lyric and rhythmically varied with vivid imagery ("air hung thick with petrichor," "water lilies bowed"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (spiral as "cipher," temple as "dream carved in alabaster"). However, the transformation sequence relies on declarative summary ("he didn't vanish—he reconfigured") rather than scene. Paraphrase loop appears in the final third: "he becomes them" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Filter verbs ("sensing," "understood") cluster in mid-beats without immediacy loss. Minor template cadence in the coda ("When someone...When someone...").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in technical beats (cross-referencing waveforms, patching the counter-generator). However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't broadcast over the signal—she interfered with it, threading her own subsonic tones into its structure, not to silence it, but to destabilize its emotional payload" immediately followed by the violin metaphor restates the same action. Template cadence runs in the opening ("adjusted her headphones... her fingers tracing... She had spent... but tonight, the signals weren't just noise") and in the Tau Ceti paragraph ("She'd seen it before—on Tau Ceti's fringe colony, where a harmonic pulse convinced..."). Stock metaphors ("like peeling skin from an apple," "like distant thunder") and filter-verb stacks ("She could feel it in the tightening") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is vivid and selective ("moon-moss," "petrified wood and silvered bone"). However, several lines loop concept without adding pressure: "not from fear of tight spaces, but from the weight of what lay buried" restates the opening's implicit tension; "not with fear, but with awe" mirrors that structure. The phrase "transfix her instantly" (should be "transfixed") is a grammatical slip. Figurative density ("liquid geometry," "cartographer of possibility") clusters in the resolution without pattern-teaching, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic, but overwriting clusters in key beats: "the quarry breathed in mist," "sky choked with cloud and silence," "mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible." Mixed metaphor: "furrowed hush wrapping each word like burial cloth"—a hush cannot furrow, and wrapping words in cloth is strained. Paraphrase loop: "Not bodies. / No blood. / No faces remembered. / Only absence" then "not violence, but erasure" restates the same content. Template cadence in the opening (sentence fragments stacked without variation) and in the mask-discovery paragraph ("Each bore…Each matched"). Figurative density in the final third dilutes immediacy. Apply −0.8 for overwriting and loops touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong verbs ("unspooled," "wept into steam," "sighed, shifted") and purposeful imagery. Sentence rhythm varies effectively. However, patterned stems appear: "She believed," "She'd pried," "She transcribed," "She questioned," "She slipped," "She opened"—template cadence in high-density beats. The phrase "not because... but because" recurs three times, creating a scaffold loop. The final paragraph's triplet repetition ("They're sung... They're forged... They're remembered") is purposeful, but earlier loops dull momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "silence pooled around him, thick as resin," "notes spiraling upward," "mist like smoke through pine needles," "disbelief that shimmered like dawn on wet stone." While vivid, the metaphors cluster in nearly every sentence, creating texture without always advancing causality or choice. Several lines paraphrase: the glass flake's "face half-formed, a road half-traveled" is restated in "the face became clearer, the road less broken." Template cadence appears in repetitive "The fiddler..." sentence openers. No outright loops or contradictions, but information density drops in the middle third where description recycles the amnesty concept without fresh pressure. Rhythm supports the lyric design, and no scaffold intrudes on the closure beat, keeping it above 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies across beats; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("train lay like a fossilized serpent," "hammock strung between chaos and clarity"). Two paraphrase loops reduce propulsion: "the train's decay mirrored his own life" is stated, then the startup-collapse parallel is restated two paragraphs later; "why some paths circle back" recurs nearly verbatim three times without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He never told… But the truth was simpler… When the startup began… Instead, he returned…" creates a repetitive syntactic drumbeat. No filter-verb stacks or artifact clusters touch the closure beat, so penalties remain capped. Information density is high in descriptive passages but thins during the summarized startup arc.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("living veins," "cryptic morse," "liquid shadow"), with mixed metaphors in the opening (stars pulse like veins, blink morse, sigh). Template cadence appears in the final third: "She would not hoard… She would weave… They would learn… They would…" (four consecutive future-tense declarations). Paraphrase loop: "to witness pain without flinching, to transmute sorrow into syntax, to let language carry what shoulders could not" restates the same content across three clauses. Overwriting in peak beats (the song, the ending) layers metaphor without added pressure. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("not for astronomy, but for translation"; "not to speak, but to sing") pad transitions. No proofreading errors.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fortress of moss and marrow," "hymns of warriors who'd laid down arms") with occasional mixed vehicles ("ribs crack—not with pain, but release" alongside "final lock fell open" mixing bone and mechanism). Several paraphrase loops: "not destruction...unbending," "not the unbending of iron...but of willow" restate the same concept across adjacent lines. Template cadence appears in the catalog of visions ("She saw the child...She saw the lover...She saw the enemy"). Rhythm remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure. No causality breaks, but artifacts dull momentum in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elevated diction is consistent but density is uneven: "anxious elation," "bruised sky," "liquid shadow and starlight" cluster in most lines without taught pattern or payoff (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't speak. She didn't need to" followed by a summary recapping prior beats rather than advancing pressure (−0.3). The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("letting her roots merge," "letting her dream-self rise") that blur concrete action. Sentence openings vary, but figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without clarifying stakes, reducing propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "roots threading through femurs and skulls like lovers reconciling after war," "resin welled like slow tears," "grief in iron" vs. "wings." Many sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor), but in high-pressure beats the metaphoric layering slows propulsion rather than accelerating it. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" constructions across paragraphs two and three. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "bartered silently" echoes the prior "barter" discussion without adding new pressure. No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative density and some synonym churn (trammel/chain, inlay/weave) dull momentum in the confrontation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines serve character or atmosphere. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during reflection: "erosion," "wind scouring shale," "terraced scars," "sleeping giants" cluster without breathing room. The phrase "echo valley longing, he thought" is a label-loop that paraphrases what the setting already shows. Sentence openings vary and syntax supports rhythm, but the reflection block (~25% of text) leans on elevated diction ("vessel for resonance without source") that slightly flattens momentum. Clarity remains intact; no causality breaks. Minor template cadence in "He didn't... Hadn't let... Hadn't let" across adjacent lines.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally high; figurative language (cuneiform wedging meaning, silence as script, arbor storing transition in magnetism) serves the concept. However, multiple lines restate core ideas with synonym variation: "not to summon, but to align" / "not with force, but with patience, with care" / "not a command. It was an invitation." Template cadence and parallelism ("Not from wind. Not from magic. From resonance.") appear in several beats, creating a rhetorical rhythm that risks scaffold when clustered. The final paragraph's "Let it grow. Let it remember. Let it become" treads close to incantatory padding. Clarity remains intact, but propulsion dips in mid-story exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "titan-gear," "oilskin whispering," "gears sighing in harmony with the lunar pull," "liquid light seep through its weave," "baptizing it anew in the solvent of surrendered paradox." Many adjacent sentences restate thematic content with synonym churn ("time doesn't stop—it folds," "to smelt here meant to refine memory by accepting contradictions," "wonder doesn't die—it molts, it moves, it migrates"). Template cadence appears in repeated "She + verb" openings and parallel structures. The overwriting touches the closure beat ("wonder doesn't die—it molts, it moves, it migrates"), triggering elevated penalties. Clarity is not broken, but momentum sags under ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "smooth as a held breath," "liquid gold," "ghost fingers," "cathedral of compression" stack figurative language densely without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in the confession sequence: "Her first...Her second...Her third..." Paraphrase loop: "She felt the pearl stirring, not as an object, but as a presence—awakening, gathering, remembering" restates across three gerunds without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy. Clarity remains intact but propulsion sags under ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and the prose is mostly clean, but several text-artifact patterns appear: template cadence ("She alluded to it…She alluded to the graffiti…She alluded to Track 3"), paraphrase loops (the "maps of emotional topography" concept is restated twice in adjacent paragraphs), and stock metaphors ("river deltas where tears had pooled"). The final third's phrasing ("still patched, still imperfect, but resonant") feels like a checklist summary. These artifacts don't obscure causality but they do dull momentum and prevent the line-level precision needed for higher bands. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "accordion…wheezed like regret" works, though "bellows…exhaled truth in wheezing gasps" borders on mixed vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythmic variety is present, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "She'd stolen it…now, it pulsed warm" repeats watch information; "She understood then" signals an insight immediately explained in the next sentence. Template cadence appears in the glyph-documentation beats ("She reached…She documented…She lifted"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching ("mist coiled into grammatical structures," "punctuation marks floated like fireflies"), which obscures rather than sharpens peak moments. The overwriting and scaffold penalties accumulate to approximately −1.2 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("bruised mulberries," "perforated destiny echoing like question marks," "green wave rippling outward") and remains coherent within the lyric register, but the accumulation in peak beats (violin sounding, seeds scattering, vines threading Chancellor's coat) risks decorative overwriting without always advancing causality. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates between long, clause-heavy lines and short declarations. Minor loops: "The wisteria sighed. The moss yawned. The ferns leaned in" reads as patterned parallelism (acceptable if taught) but "silence—thick, velvet silence" and "propagate... propagated... propagating" recur without added pressure. Clarity remains high; no causality break. Information density is moderate; some lines (e.g., "velvet observatory hummed with the breath of midsummer") serve atmosphere more than plot. The final paragraph's repetition ("not in soil, but in silence. Not by wind, but by witness") is purposeful but borders on rhetorical flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery ("condensed skylight," "powdered starlight"). However, figurative density is high across most sentences without a taught pattern or closure payoff: "cathedral of air and ice," "corridor of suspended light," "doorway woven from the static between stars" stack metaphors in quick succession, some mixed (light "drips" photons that "pool" but never evaporate—how does solid light flow?). Paraphrase appears: "not with heat or force, but with surrender" and "not with grief but reverence" use identical syntactic frames. The loop/scaffold penalty is moderate; clarity at closure remains intact, so deductions stay within the non-closure cap.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, opening and closing lines anchor voice. Clarity is mostly clean. Weaknesses: figurative density saturates many sentences ("wine settling in a cask," "veiled in drifting cloud," "tide of time reshape," "embers banked," "vineyard hush") without taught patterning, creating mild overwriting. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs nine and ten both explain "scallop" through memory/breath/turning—conceptual redundancy across adjacent units. Template-stem runs appear ("She remembered," "She lifted," "She rose," "She smiled," "She stepped") in the final third, flattening propulsion when tighter syntax would accelerate. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum, capping the score under 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraphs breathe with the beats. Information density is high: "cloak of doubt" is both literal garment and symbol without redundancy. Minor scaffold detected: "Of course it did" in paragraph following the clasp resistance reads as filler that paraphrases the prior beat. "The wind rose again, insistent, and the chimes clattered—sharper this time, impatient" nearly loops the chime-pressure motif without added detail. Figurative language ("shadow given form," "compass pointing inward") remains clear. Propulsion solid; no major clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the stone-toss beat. However, scaffold and near-loops appear: "She weaved no more truths tonight. / She withheld nothing now" is a paraphrase pair, and "Elira said nothing. / She withheld explanation" closely restates the same intent within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "Through the trance. / Through patience. / Through the sycamore hush" in the final lines, while rhythmically intentional, flatten propulsion at closure. Figurative density ("temporal notation," "fractured light") remains controlled and legible. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., "It did not move… movement was the enemy" / "It would not move… let the world move around it") and template cadence ("It did not smile. It did not weep. It simply knew") appear in high-pressure beats (−0.6). Figurative density is high without taught pattern or payoff: "towers of bone," "dust motes," "fossilized marrow," "aerial hymn," "node in the world's quiet network" stack within single paragraphs without causal pressure (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("duty as your skin," "physics dressed in reverence") reduce specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate the skimmer's stillness without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. The opening paragraph stacks modifiers heavily ("not by design but by default"; "ghost-light of spells long expired, still clinging...") and "accommodates impossibilities" is repeated verbatim across paragraphs without added meaning, creating a paraphrase loop. The phrase "brilliant dimness between cloud and star" appears only in the final sentence without prior pattern-teaching, reading as a late tonal insert. Minor template cadence in the cloud-tree sequence ("not with flowers, but with tiny, radiant doors"; "not for loss, but recognition") where parallelism becomes predictable. No major clarity breaks, but figurative density in the opening and slight scaffold near closure prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and discovery. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the dive sequence and breathing at closure. However, figurative density approaches overwriting in the opening third: "drowned stars reborn," "color of sound," "metronome counting toward revelation," "pages blooming like anemones" cluster without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "He didn't chase her" followed immediately by "Truth, he knew, hides behind truth" restates non-pursuit thematically without added pressure. Stock metaphor "cathedral" for the ballroom recurs without fresh angle. No major scaffold or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("honeyed light," "sugar in hot tea," "fallen stars"), but several metaphors stack without clear connective logic: "stellar doubt that pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar" mixes astronomical scale with bodily sensation in a way that strains clarity. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "Then, a voice… Then she stood… Then she stepped…" creates a mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "She didn't draw lots. She didn't consult the static" followed immediately by "She raised the drachma… and smiled" restates the same decision without added pressure. Information density is high in the opening third but sags mid-piece during the extended vision description.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is mostly coherent. Sentence openings vary. However, the piece carries measurable text-pattern debt: synonym churn around "echo" (echoes, echo of sacrifice, echoes forgotten phrases), template-cadence runs ("He remembered her: not in face or voice, but in the hollow…"; "not alive, but resonant"; "not as beasts, but as witnesses"), and stock metaphor strings ("frost," "cathedral of solitude," "broken teeth biting into twilight"). These artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats and dull immediacy, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.6 in Q7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the automatic cap rule.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentences are long and contemplative, accelerating at the resin-setting beat. Information density is high: "not enchanted, not cursed, merely refined from pine tapped under three different moons" does triple duty (world rule, character method, specificity). Minor penalties: "Each drop was a syllable; each basin, a counter; each measured interval, a note" is a three-part list that edges toward rhetorical symmetry rather than scene pressure. One paraphrase loop: "not with a flash, but with a sigh" / "not in triumph, but in quiet confirmation" recycles the structure. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several runs exhibit template cadence: "No one cried. / No one shouted. / They simply listened" deploys parallelism purposefully, yet earlier sequences like "Each image surfaced near a relic: a child's shoe...a rusted tricycle...a wedding veil" list without distinct pressure. The phrase "spun stories into shared meaning" recurs (paragraphs ~10 and ~17), creating mild paraphrase drift. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor clarity slip: "the midnight ridgeway at twilight" presents a temporal contradiction (midnight vs. twilight) that disorients without clear payoff. Overwriting is controlled; figurative language ("knuckles of a drowning man") is vivid but not stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.7)
    Density penalty: figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff ("lovers hesitant to wake a dreamer," "brushstrokes in a divine canvas," "hymn older than language," "soul's architecture"), triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "not epiphany shouted…but revelation whispered" restates the same content; "not as scientist, but as child" / "not from sorrow, but from recognition" / "not gold from lead, but awe from rigor" recycle structure without added pressure (−0.4 template cadence). Register drift into elevated philosophical diction ("epistemological communion," "covenant," "vessel") outside a working alchemist's lexical range (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty −1.3; artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory anchors ("cold metal of the parachute buckle," "ironwood railing," "sky-bridge of woven vines"). Information density is high in the opening and chime sequence. Deductions accumulate: paraphrase loop in mid-section (paragraphs 6–7 restate "the body remembers" without added pressure). Template cadence in the final third: "not because it was loud, but because…" / "not as noise, but as vibration" / "not with stoicism, but with invention" / "not toward noise, but toward" (four parallel constructions in ~150 words). Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph describing the chime's spread. The loops and stems dull momentum in the closure approach. Combined penalties: −0.8 for paraphrase/template cadence, −0.3 for filter reliance. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, patterned artifacts cluster: abstract noun stacks ("the prison of identity," "the vibration of opposing truths held in equilibrium," "the quiet glow of presence, of feeling without ownership, of love without claim") and synonym/paraphrase loops ("not as trauma, but as release" / "not by force, but by invitation" / "not life, but aliveness") recur in peak beats, dulling propulsion. The final third deploys template "not X, but Y" cadence across multiple lines without taught pattern, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative language—"tendrils of bioluminescent fluid curling," "fractal auroras," "body shaped by paradox"—is vivid but dense enough in the climax to slow momentum. Grammar and spatial choreography are clean; proofreading is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is rhythmically ambitious with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail ("syrupy silence," "giggle ricochets," "tunnel's ribs"). However, pervasive overwriting undermines clarity: nearly every sentence layers metaphor or poetic device without pattern-teaching or payoff ("macerates grief," "silence bleeds sound," "marrow between heartbeats"). Paraphrase loops appear: "He sings to the walls. / He sings to the wind. / He sings to the ghost" restates intent without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in parallel structures ("not with blades or fire, but via"; "not by resurrecting the dead, but by refusing"). The final third accumulates figurative density ("tunnel shivers," "curved throat," "tinny, triumphant") that obscures rather than sharpens the closure beat. Stock metaphors ("wind chime," "pendulum counting down") and abstract nouns ("resonance," "forgiveness," "permission") dilute specificity. Filter-verb stacks in reflective blocks ("he remembers," "he knows," "he's learned") flatten immediacy. Apply −1.2 for pervasive figurative muddle and loops, −0.5 for artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats stack metaphors without clear vehicle logic: "boundaries of light" are edges "sharper than any blade—and softer than any sigh," then "membranes," then "gradients"—mixed vehicles that blur rather than clarify. Minor paraphrase loop: "It didn't know if they heard. It didn't need them to" restates the same stance without added pressure. The elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "interiorizing exteriors") is voice-consistent but occasionally slows momentum in peak beats. Information density is high overall; no major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, overwriting clusters in the final third: "burden and benediction," "not in farewell, but in affirmation," "portable, personal, potent," and multiple "not X, but Y" parallelisms create template cadence. The phrase "frozen bloom" recurs without evolving function. Mixed metaphor: frost "blooms" then "melts into light," but earlier the bloom was "delicate and lethal"—the vehicle's logic shifts. Stock phrases ("held breath," "penny dropped") appear at closure beats. These artifacts touch the ending; combined penalty −1.0 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and individual images are vivid ("oxidized chrome," "frost-glazed metal"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "serenely electric" repeats three times, "suspended" twice in close proximity, and the phrase "not [X] but [Y]" recurs mechanically ("not for ghosts, but for silence"; "not sound. / Not light."; "not magic divorced from mechanism, but wonder rooted in function"). Template cadence in the closure sequence—"Antennae straightened. / Capacitors glowed. / Static became symphony."—flattens propulsion. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and filter-verb cluster (−0.3) penalties totals −0.9, lowering from a ~7.1 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece cycles through template cadences: "He didn't [X]. Didn't [Y]. Just worked…" (paragraph 16), "Didn't cheer. Didn't cry. He simply…" (paragraph 20), and repetitive "not [X], but [Y]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 restates vanishing as "not sunk, not capsized, but cleanly erased" and "as if time itself blinked," then paragraph 9 rephrases as "not accidents… corrections… oscillating, caught between parallel timelines." The final third stacks filter-verb phrases ("he placed," "began to hum," "whispered") and leans on stock mystical imagery ("liquid starlight," "void," "ghostly ripples") without fresh specificity. Momentum stalls in the middle section where the deckhand's research (tide tables, star charts, logbooks) is summarized rather than dramatized, and the grotto's responses (stalactites, eels) feel ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "Marble cracked into lace. Staircases dissolved into ribbons of shadow." A paraphrase loop appears mid-story ("She remembered… remembered… remembered") within a single beat, and "This was no metaphor" followed immediately by abstract explanation reads as scaffold. Template cadence emerges in the architect's weaving sequence: "A flicker of childhood laughter here. A shard of betrayal there." The closure beat is vivid and propulsive, but elevated diction ("tessellated across decades," "bifurcated under pressure") in peak moments drifts from the POV's embodied urgency into academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several beats rely on declarative exposition: "Her motivation wasn't nostalgia; it was necessity" and "That phrase—edge geometry—became her mantra" tell rather than show through scene pressure. The anchor chain passage uses strong concrete detail ("rusted and heavy," "cold iron weight"), but the subsequent classroom speech recycles the chain link metaphor with paraphrase loops: "We are not weights...We are not relics...We are navigators." Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt not fear, but awe") and template cadence in the final lecture beats slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts touch closure, but density could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies effectively and sensory detail is vivid, but overwriting clusters in the opening and closure: "mist-clad atrium," "marble veined with forgotten histories," "bruised twilight into liquid gold puddles," "voice low as falling ash" stack figurative language densely without pattern-teaching or cost. The phrase "vulnerable voice, fractured by grief, stranded between worlds" is a metaphor pile-up. "Quiet, incidental heroism: the choice to kneel in the damp, to tune broken devices, to assure a lost child she still mattered" is authorial summary that scaffolds theme rather than letting the scene stand. Minor filter-verb reliance ("She recognized," "She knew") in exposition. Information density is high in action beats but dips during thematic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "claustrophobia a live wire sparking against stone," "tide groaning like a dying thing," "walls softened, not to liquid, but to memory." While many images are vivid and purposeful, the cumulative effect in peak beats (the phase-transition sequence) risks overwriting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, which dilutes propulsion when urgency should tighten syntax. Minor template cadence in the descent sequence ("She passed a cafeteria..."; "She touched it..."; "She placed the gold fleck...") and a paraphrase loop around "the unremembered" reduce density. Information density is generally strong, and no major artifacts obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. Information density is high in the ink-bloom sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The ghosts whispered… pleading, confused, yearning" restates "orphaned code… pooled in dead servers" without added pressure; "Not erased. Not fixed. But… arranged. Defragmented." cycles synonyms. Template cadence in the heartbeat-count lines ("seventeen thousand, eight hundred and twelve… nine hundred and three… four… five…") reads mechanical rather than voice-driven. Figurative density ("feathered," "breath on a mirror," "bloomed," "dendritic veins," "capillaries") clusters without always advancing the beat. Total deductions in the −1.0 to −1.3 range for loops and artifact patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("It did not burn her. / It did not whisper. / It waited." establishes tone, object, and tension). Information density is high in the opening third, but the middle section loops conceptually: "texture," "resonance," "timbre," "emotional residue" recur without added pressure. The phrase "the grain of grief in a vowel, the roughness of joy in a glottal stop" is vivid, but similar constructions repeat ("rasp of longing, velvet hush of regret, brittle snap of resolve") without advancing causality. No major clarity issues, but the metaphoric density in peak beats (diamond awakening, language emerging) occasionally obscures the mechanics of what is happening on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    High figurative density ("static-laden confessions," "gravitationally playful presence," "syllables of collapsing stars," "gravitational giggles") pervades most sentences, reducing clarity in peak beats and flattening propulsion. Template cadence runs appear: "She'd traced… She'd spent…" and "not noise, but language: syllables of… apologies from… lullabies sung by…" create rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops: the arrowhead's properties are restated across multiple sentences without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "bitterness… transmuted into gravitational giggles, swirling around her like cosmic dust motes catching starlight" blends psychological state, physics metaphor, and visual image incoherently. The ornate diction ("frostbitten hope," "sympathetic resonance") reads more as lexical display than momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph) with unearned epiphany phrasing ("no longer undercover, no longer bitter, walked lighter than air"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("curled downward like a falling leaf," "tactile ghost," "seeping into cracks," "candle wax near flame"), creating texture but slowing propulsion and obscuring causal links. Paraphrase loops appear: "She played not to defy, but to signal" / "Each phrase was a coded plea" restate the same idea. The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("baptism," "quiet thunder," "molting") without clear connective tissue. Template cadence: "She played... She shifted key... She played louder... She didn't stop" across consecutive beats. Apply −0.8 for density and loop artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic, with strong openings ("The disputed territory mailman pedaled his rusted trike") and vivid sensory detail. However, figurative density is excessive in high-pressure beats: "neon flickering like dying stars," "shadows as if afraid to touch the walls," "dust motes into spirals," "jealous of the storm he'd caged." Multiple sentences in the arcade sequence rely on metaphor where concrete action would sharpen momentum. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He nodded… He placed… He watched…" The final paragraph's "brittle hush" callback is purposeful, but synonym churn surrounds it ("lone sentinel," "disputed dark"). Information density is high, but overwriting slows the drone-launch beat when clarity and propulsion are needed most.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"syrup" time, "curious cats" mist, "tired beasts" train cars, "caramel ghosts"—and while individually effective, the accumulation in every beat creates a lyric gloss that slows momentum. Several metaphors verge on mixed: "silence became song, became sanctuary, became salvation" chains abstractions without concrete anchoring. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "not with voice, but with hands, with breath, with the tilt…" and "One horse lowered…Another turned…" Propulsion suffers in the middle third as description dominates action. No paraphrase loops, but the ornamental density and unvaried lyricism prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high. Two textural artifacts lower the score: decorative doublets ("not stored, not archived"; "not metaphorically, not sentimentally") and one paraphrase loop (scarf description recycled across two beats without new pressure). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "memory: sudden, seamless, saturated" uses alliteration purposefully. Sentence openings vary. The final paragraph resets satisfaction too tidily ("utterly satisfied") after no visible cost. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyrically dense with vivid imagery ("dawn's first blush," "solar breath," "tide bells"), but figurative language clusters heavily in nearly every sentence without always advancing pressure, risking overwriting (−0.4). Several paraphrase loops appear: "not for nostalgia, but for proof that longing could be made tangible" echoes the broader thesis without adding new pressure; "the parchment sighed. Then laughed" is efficient, but the surrounding lines ("warm and trembling," "held breath before a wish") stack modifiers without tightening momentum. Syntax varies purposefully, and no grammatical errors or filter-verb stacks obstruct clarity. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (e.g., the sailor's lullaby beat vivifies the archive and foreshadows the dream's return), but scaffolding remains: "Among her tools, none was stranger nor more sacred than..." is a stock opener that could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative density is high ("threshold woven from shadow and starlight," "mirrors that showed not his face, but the faces"), and no pronoun ambiguity appears. Template cadence emerges in peak beats: "He whispered no incantation, spoke no name… He did not flinch… He simply reached" (three parallel negations without escalation; −0.5). Mixed metaphor: "walls became sky, sky became memory, memory became a corridor"—the sequence is poetic but the vehicle logic is contradictory (−0.3). Information density sags in the middle third where synonym churn ("shadow and starlight" recurs four times without reweighting).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (the greenhouse description establishes setting, atmosphere, and the orchard's lethal mechanism simultaneously). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through the research sequence and breathing at the scent-memory moment. Minor paraphrase appears in the "not grief, but vacancy—memories stolen" / "memories didn't flood back—they seeped" construction, and "Curiosity, after all, was her oldest habit" leans slightly toward summary-as-closure rather than pure image. Figurative language (iron sentinels, cathedral of lost seasons, hinge between worlds) remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high: "afternoon shadow caught in glass stretches diagonally across the marble floor—not cast, but trapped" does triple work (world rule, visual anchor, stakes seed). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the cartographer exchange, breathing in the staircase retreat. However, figurative language clusters densely in early paragraphs without pattern-teaching: "curl of bergamot-stained oolong predicting rebellion," "radial fracture of pu-erh signaling bureaucratic collapse" reads ornamental until the method pays off mid-story. Minimal loops; one template stem ("She walks backwards") recurs but voice-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is lush ("moss that sighed with ancient memory," "filament—shimmering, supple, alive"), but density of metaphor in nearly every sentence risks overwriting without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "not with soil or sun, but by capturing essence. Essence of joy. Essence of surprise" repeats the concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly, and no grammatical errors obscure meaning, but the elevated texture becomes uniform rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    High figurative density pervades every beat without modulation: "swollen with salt and silence," "cathedral of captured starlight," "liquid whispers," "bright and brief...like breath on glass," "moths unsure of flame." In the climactic knot-piercing paragraph, metaphor stacks continue ("scream," "teeth," "heart," "roared," "gale of withheld truth") rather than compressing to direct action. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She didn't [X]. She'd done this before. Not here, not under starlight, but in..." Paraphrase loop: "She didn't thank her. Didn't need to." and "She would rest tonight. Tomorrow, another mask..." recycle stems. Information density is high, but propulsion is dulled by ornamental saturation. Applying −0.8 for figurative overload in peak beats and −0.4 for template/loop patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with strong lines like "each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss." One persistent pattern weakens clarity: stacked metaphoric constructions in adjacent sentences ("not void but vessel," "not brick or timber, but negative space," "not gone, but folded") create a template cadence that flattens propulsion in the final third (−0.6). Minor paraphrase loops appear ("the silence had been speaking all along" echoes earlier claims about silence as presence). Information density is high, but figurative saturation in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level clarity and propulsion are strong. Rhythm varies purposefully: long lyric sentences ("wind whipping my coat like impatient hands") alternate with terse turns ("I waved back. It was enough."). Minor artifacts: "the snow globe humming beside me" and "swirling with miniature blizzards" in early beats lean slightly ornamental before causal work begins. The final sequence is clean and charged. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the ending recharges the death-acquaintance motif.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages but thins during the encoding sequence, which recounts three spray-can strokes without advancing pressure. Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening two paragraphs deploys metaphor or elevated figuration ("silence rang like struck crystal," "time stretched like taffy," "chromatic runes"), creating density that blurs immediacy. The bolt plate description ("grooved steel surface, once part of a forgotten printing press") is expository scaffolding mid-action. Minor paraphrase loop: "encode" and "encoded" appear in five sentences within a twelve-line span without pressure escalation. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in high-pressure beats and minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic construction ("cloth softer than snowfall," "breath on ice," "lanterns refusing to dim")—which becomes ornamental rather than pressure-driven in middle beats. Several paraphrase loops: lines 10–11 repeat the "unfolding" concept without adding pressure; lines 24–25 restate "not to be solved, but absorbed" in adjacent clauses. Template cadence: "She did not rush. She knelt. She breathed." reads as purposeful triplet, but similar structures recur. Information density is moderate; many lines do one job (describe) rather than two. Propulsion sags in the middle third where discovery is stretched across multiple beats without escalation. No major causality breaks, but scaffold and poetic padding lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, scattered text artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("Each entry was a memorial, a whispered epitaph" followed shortly by "Each cloud she categorized was a memorial"), template cadence in some ledger-entry beats, and stacked metaphorical constructions that occasionally blur rather than sharpen ("starlight that clung like powdered memory" works, but the density of figurative language in some paragraphs—frayed thread, wicker floor dusted with starlight, vapor's shadow, cloud's tremor—approaches saturation without always serving pressure). "Quietly explosive" repeats as both self-description and cloud label, which functions thematically but edges toward synonym churn. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Grammar and sequence clarity are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high; most lines layer sensory detail with internal shift. Rhythm varies and accelerates ("She painted faster now"). However, several beats exhibit mild overwriting: "swirling with the ghost-light of dead astronomers" and "a comet's tail arcing over the hollow's northern curve" stack figurative language in the closure paragraph without clear payoff. The phrase "a map of muscle and memory she felt rather than saw" is template-adjacent and repeated conceptually. No loops or scaffolding, but density in high-pressure beats crosses into ornamental. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in closure beats and minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The hopscotch discovery sequence is propulsive. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He'd found more than a discovery. He'd found a language" restates without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the opening (multiple clauses beginning with relative pronouns). Stock metaphors ("groaned like old bones," "living inkblots") and synonym churn ("whispered," "whispering," "whisper") cluster in key beats. These artifacts dull momentum and prevent entry into the 7+ band despite otherwise clean grammar and spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is vivid ("moonlight itself had been woven," "memory—the driftwood nostalgia"). However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "not to fix the world… but to understand why some breaks cannot be mended… and which ones must be" restates the same concept across three clauses. Template cadence in the mirror sequence ("They showed her… They showed her… They showed her") and elevated diction ("reharmonization," "latent purpose") in peak beats reduce propulsion (−0.6). The final third includes scaffold ("not from loss, but surrender") that abstracts rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("floating rock arches," "sky-eels," "brambled hope") without pattern-teaching or consistent payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't command; she reminded" followed immediately by "Of who they'd been. Of who they could be." Template cadence runs in the final paragraph ("not control, but catalysis. Not salvation delivered, but summoned"). Mixed metaphors: "hope was brambled but blooming" strains coherence. Clarity remains functional; propulsion is sluggish due to synonym churn and scaffold sentences that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "hush" appears in eight distinct phrasings (pane of hush, hush of time's final ripple, final quiet, velvet hush, gathering dark); "nested patterns" and "fractal lullabies" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "not with X, but with Y" appears four times ("not to warn, but to cradle"; "not with voice, but with resonance"; "not with lungs, but with soul"; "not in violence, but in drowsy surrender"). Stock metaphors cluster: "cracked like a dried riverbed," "folding inward like petals at twilight," "dew on spider silk." Figurative density obscures cause/effect in peak beats—the final dissolution ("glass dissolved into mist, stone into memory") replaces concrete closure with elevated abstraction. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "assembling" and "offhandedly exact." Information density is high across beats (nut as key, blueprint in grooves, candle smoke and mirrors for deciphering). Two deductions: "offhandedly exact" recurs three times as a template phrase (−0.3), and "the orchard sighed around him, ancient and ungrateful, and he sighed back" edges into mirrored figurative convenience (−0.2). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or scaffold elsewhere. Clarity and propulsion strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in most beats. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "separation wasn't failure. / It was phase change. / Transformation required rupture" restates the same insight across three lines without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the polymer-redesign paragraph ("She'd redesign... A scaffold that sang... She'd name it..."). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "liquid gold," "wild, temporary sculptures," "proof of contact" dilute specificity. The closure dream sequence ("polymers blooming like lilies") introduces figurative language that wasn't pattern-taught earlier, creating mild tonal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "tectonic plates of narrative," "frozen breath stylus," "static and starlight," "glowing labyrinth" stack metaphors without pattern-taught payoff. Paraphrase loop: "She felt lighter, not because her burden had lessened, but because she had learned to distribute its weight—parcel it out in measured doses, trade it for other people's hollows" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template cadence appears in the transaction sequence: "A patron drifted in... He hesitated, then nodded... She watched him wander... A second patron entered... The patron selected." Deductions: −0.6 for density/coherence, −0.4 for template runs = baseline ~6.2.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences ("wind-carved halls," "tide-stranded jellyfish," "cathedral of calcified sea-life," "liquid shadow, swirling in slow, lunar rhythms"), creating a lush but dense texture that slows momentum during high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in the pavilion sequence: "a mother's last lullaby, a soldier's choked apology, a lover's unsent letter"—three parallel noun phrases without variation. Paraphrase loop: "To subsume was to swallow oceans… each contact layering grief upon grief" restates the same content. Minor clarity issues (no pronoun confusion, no syntax breaks) and strong sentence variety in the opening third keep the score above 5.0, but the density and loop artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap this category below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten with figurative density in nearly every sentence: "under the hush of borrowed starlight," "metronome ticks against rusted rungs," "whispered guidance," "airy despair," "runaway thought," "zodiacs mid-dance," "valley's throat," "startled birds," "seismic whispers," "cathedral choirs," "star-seeded soil," "earned sunrise." Mixed metaphors appear ("bridges from silos—not walls" conflates structural and barrier metaphors). Paraphrase loops recur: the elevator's silence is restated three times in adjacent paragraphs ("murmurs," "sighed," "voice buried"). Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("began to sing," "letting each syllable resonate," "answered in kind, weaving"). Template cadence runs: "She carried no lantern... She'd chosen it deliberately... She knew tongues were not barriers... She began to sing... She sang of harvests... She lowered the cuckoo weight." Information density is low; many sentences perform atmosphere without advancing goal, opposition, or knowledge. Artifacts appear in the closure third (the summarized dawn/noon/dusk sequence), disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences ("helix-minded," "canyon's throat," "ghosts in a prism," "synaptic plasticity," "palimpsest," "cathedral of her mind"), creating density but also mild overwriting that slows momentum in a lyric piece where every image should propel. Mixed metaphors: "canyon exhaled" (organic) adjacent to "synaptic light" (technical). Paraphrase loop: "She did not weep for the dreams; she modified them" and "She had not come to mourn. She had come to modify" restate the thesis without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She had not come to mourn. / She had come to modify. / And in modifying, to resurrect." Stock phrases: "heart thrumming," "eyes wet but unblinking." Deductions: −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for loops and stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphors = baseline ~5.9.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries metaphor or ornate diction ("spectral halos that whispered secrets," "pulsing orb of layered crystal"). This density without pattern-teaching or purposeful variation flattens momentum rather than escalating it, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "The doodle was no key" restates the prior sentence's implication; "she seized it; the moment her fingers brushed" doubles the touch. Template stems recur ("She stepped," "She pressed," "She traced," "She followed," "She reached"). Stock metaphors—"tearing silk" appears twice, "blade through silk" and "peeling apart like pages of a book"—and elevated diction ("clandestinely," "vigilance," "latent") cluster without variation. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    High figurative density throughout without pattern-teaching: "roots cradled earth like cupped palms," "frozen smoke," "golden thread," "moth's wing against glass" in most beats. Multiple paraphrase loops: "silence swallowed" echoed in "hollow... resonance vacuumed"; "strummed the air" repeated across beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the carving sequence: "He hollowed... He embedded... When the last shaving fell." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. Clarity remains intact but density without propulsion triggers −0.8 cumulative in Q7, and the concentration in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during meditation and shorter beats at closure ("He didn't look back. He didn't need to."). Information density is high; most lines layer memory, sensation, and metaphor. However, paraphrase loops appear: "translate silence" restated across multiple lines without added pressure, and "not…but" constructions recur (five instances). Template cadence: "He'd been…He'd stumbled…He would find" stems cluster. Stock metaphors: "fractures let in light," "compass calibrated to inner north." These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally; none touch the closure beat directly but they dull propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "frequencies wove together like braided silk," "diary clasp forged from meteorite iron and hummingbird vertebrae." Yet several metaphors blur sense—"jars of petrified silence" and "layers of compressed silence" invite visualization but resist physical logic, and "a lullaby for locked things" straddles the line between resonant and precious. Template-cadence check flags paired sentence openers in the final third: "She packed the final vial… just as the sky detonated," "She smiled… at the symphony within," "Tomorrow, she'd begin again…" creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear: "no grand monologues, no false crescendos, only the quiet truth of listening" echoes the earlier "not fixing, not saving, but resonating." Information density is moderate; the middle beats (frequency adjustments) repeat structure without sharp propulsion. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch closure directly, capping deductions under the non-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; opening lines anchor voice ("clung to ancient boughs like lichen to stone"). Information density is high in the bloom sequence. However, overwriting clusters in exposition: "the undercurrent of wisdom that flows beneath all chaos," "serenity within motion—to find stillness not in stagnation, but in the dance of change itself" stack metaphors without clear vehicle. Figurative language saturates several beats ("sleeping serpents," "silent symphonies," "velvet scream") without pattern-teaching. The wrapping-paper detail is vivid but arrives late as backstory. No major loops, but synonym churn appears in the theme paragraphs ("serenity," "equilibrium," "stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory density is high without clutter. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff ("liquid memory," "whirling silence," "gathering of echoes" all vie for symbolic weight), triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are present: "It didn't pierce. It planted. It resonated" restates the same content across three lines without added pressure. The closure beat is clean, capping non-closure deductions, but the cumulative line-level debt lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Two mild artifacts: "rapidly adapting wasn't just a phrase from my training manual—it was the nature of this place" is a thesis statement that tells what the prior scene has shown, and "Let it learn me too. Let it know I was watching. Let it know I was ready" uses anaphora for emphasis but edges toward rhetorical padding. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, and the closure image remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy overwriting throughout. Nearly every sentence carries figurative density ("breath curling like spectral notation," "liquid sapphire," "silk scarves woven from silence and starlight") without pattern-taught payoff, creating sustained elevated diction that flattens rather than charges the beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "not by decree, but by vibration, by hue, by the courage..." echoes prior enumerations. Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across paragraphs. Register drift into abstract philosophy ("wonder, left unacknowledged, becomes brittle") clashes with the embodied ritual. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; appearance in final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet despite the name" delivers setting, paradox, and voice). Opening and closing lines anchor well: the kneeling keeper and the final koan frame the arc. Minor scaffold appears in the three-realm exposition block where "One realm...Another...The third" cycles through identical stems, costing ~−0.4, and a few lines lean slightly purple ("silence fell like snow after a storm, avalanchingly quiet"). No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. The piece sustains clarity and propulsion through its reflection-heavy middle without stalling momentum, and key beats (stepping through, walking away) remain concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "grief could be graphed, joy differentiated, love integrated" immediately follows "the slope of a sigh, the integral of a sob, the asymptote of longing," restating the same conceit. Template cadence runs dominate ("She didn't distribute them; they found their recipients—left on doorsteps, tucked into library books, slipped between..."). Filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she suspected," "she realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("ink in water," "tongues of fire and frost," "slots between their ribs where new equations took root") cluster without fresh transformation. The final third inherits these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during wonder-extension and shorter beats at the fork and child encounter. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, density artifacts cluster in the opening and middle: "vibrated sympathetically," "attuning to...hidden frequencies," "translating landscape into lullaby, dread into delight" stack metaphoric abstractions without concrete payoff, and "germinate awe in barren moments" repeats conceptually across adjacent beats. The phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" (appearing twice) functions as thematic anchor but borders on loop. "She walked faster now, not fleeing, but seeding—each footfall a tiny tremor, each breath a note" demonstrates strong figurative control under pressure, but earlier sections show template-lyric cadence (dash-linked oppositions recurring mechanically). Clarity remains high; no major ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("mist curling like breath," "frost was its skin, its diary, its confession," "rainbows that tasted of salt") and occasionally stacks without advancing causality—"shifted hush," "rearrangement of stillness," and "velvet" all describe the same atmospheric effect within a few lines. Several paraphrase loops: "not to escape, not to hide" / "neither fame nor redemption"; "not the crash, but the quiet before" / "not regret, but relief." Template openings ("She had come," "She believed," "She saw," "She knew," "She would") create monotonous cadence across eight paragraphs. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty but scaffold persists. Clarity holds; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("raveling silence," "time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). Template cadence appears in the weaving sequence: "The first pass pulled a sigh... the second, a shiver... With each shuttle throw, a piece of her dissolved." Paraphrase loops: "raveling silence" recurs four times; "time's unraveling tapestry" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" is repeated verbatim as a nested descriptor. These artifacts cluster in peak beats (the solstice weaving), dulling propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 for loops and template cadence touching closure. Information density is high but clarity suffers under the figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong figurative language and varied syntax. Information density is high in scene-setting but thins in the middle third, where repeated descent-and-gift cycles paraphrase the same content without added pressure. Template cadence appears: "He descended," "He worked," "He knew," stacking filter verbs and scaffolding across multiple beats. The opening image is strong; the final paragraph overexplains ("He had become the barter. The awakening wasn't behind him..."), summarizing theme rather than trusting the image. Minimal proofreading issues, but the synonym churn around "silk" and "glyph" and the recycled interiority stems lower propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy figurative density in most sentences without breathing room: "dust motes…a ghost of engines," "film peeling from reality's surface," "syrup made of memory," "unbearable lightness of knowing." Multiple mixed metaphors and elevated diction ("cyclically spontaneous," "lodestone," "residual warmth") obscure momentum in peak beats. Paraphrase loops: "not for direction, but for resonance" / "not from wind or magnetism, but from the pull of adjacent possibilities" share the same template stem. Template cadence: "not…but…" and "where it [verb], [noun]; where it [verb], [noun]" recur without taught pattern. Apply −0.9 for figurative muddle and template runs, and −0.4 for register drift touching closure ("unbearable lightness of knowing"). Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies well; sentence openings and lengths create natural cadence. Information density is high in the opening (skipper role, cargo, letters, grief all compressed efficiently). The stone-stacking sequence is concrete and propulsive. However, the final paragraph stacks abstract emotional summarizing ("warmth he carried," "ache...wasn't sharp anymore—it was luminescent," "quiet beacon he himself had lit") where a concrete final image would land harder. Minor filter-verb use ("felt it," "knew someone would") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. The "feathered tax collectors" and "velvet dark" show strong figurative control elsewhere, but the closure beat leans toward telling the transformation rather than showing it through action or perception, applying the −0.6 to −0.8 range for summary in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("wind chimes forged from lightning," "velvet night," "silver needles stitching warnings"), flattening hierarchy and dulling closure charge. Template cadence in the middle third: "Each night, she climbed... Each dawn, she whispered..." Paraphrase loops: "She was accidentally prophetic" is restated in the next three sentences. Mixed metaphor: "inverted shadow, a darkness that illuminated" contradicts physical logic. Register drift into cosmic abstraction clashes with the concrete fisherman beat. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("her shadow stretched long and luminous"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "iridescent caution made manifest" describes the wing while foreshadowing theme). Rhythm varies effectively—long contemplative sentences during observation beats, shorter syntax at the climactic dye act. Minor template cadence in the observation sequence: "She noticed... That was the first clue... By the twelfth sunrise..." creates a chronicle rhythm that slightly flattens momentum mid-piece. One paraphrase loop: "to understand why some people magnetize stories" recurs near-identically without added pressure. The final paragraph's figurative density ("valley mist curled around... like a question") risks overwriting but remains legible and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("Its brass limbs lay twisted, its arc fractured, yet the worker felt it hummed with a quiet grief"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Penalties accumulate: paraphrase loops in the opening (sweat-wiping, trudging, haste-vanishing astronomer all frontloaded without pressure), template cadence in the middle ("How the old maple... How the gnarled yew... How the slender birch"), and elevated diction that clashes with the worker's practical role ("arboreal," "quantified sorrow," "cartographer of witnessed sorrow"). The closure beat itself remains clear, but artifacts in the final third ("mundane, miraculous, and finally, mercifully, mapped") disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("swaddle newborns, soothe the grieving, and stitch neighbors into kin"). Mixed metaphors appear ("roots beneath a forest floor" adjacent to textile weaving; "cradle" and "shroud" used interchangeably). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "She was no longer keeper of fragments. She was the loom" echoes "She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it how to hold itself." Template stems recur: "She remembered… She closed… She let… She wept… She was…" The high metaphor load in peak beats and synonym churn ("resonance… vibration… rhythm… harmony") trigger the artifact penalty pack; total deduction −1.0 in Q7, with artifacts touching closure disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled, with strong images like "moonlight pooled like liquid silver" and "time thinning like old parchment." Information density is high in the library's details. However, the piece carries multiple scaffold and loop artifacts: "She had hidden," "She did not leave. She did not stay as she had," and the triple cadence "no longer hiding, no longer gone" recycle syntax without added pressure. The phrase "not as plea, not as penance, but as presence" and similar parallelism patterns become template-like across the final third. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure, and the line "the deepest libraries are not made of stone and ink, but of compassion willing to dwell in the crumpled places" reads as sermonic summary. Cumulative artifact penalty (template cadence, summary-heavy closure, paraphrase loops) totals approximately −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. However, multiple figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "patience is the grammar of absolution," "silence steep," "memories refusing to settle," "tiny defiance," "prayer whispered into dirt." In a high-density lyric mode this density can work, but here it occasionally obscures clarity (what does "grammar of absolution" concretely mean for her choice?). Minor paraphrase loop: "She doesn't know if they'll grow. That's not the point. The point is the gesture…" restates across three sentences. Stock metaphor: "loss becomes wallpaper" is familiar phrasing. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages but stay under three per cluster. The prose is clean and proofread, with strong verb choices (squats, swallow, muffles, stirred) and no major syntactic monotony. Opening and closing lines are purposeful. Figurative density in non-peak beats and one loop trigger moderate deductions but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high and most sentences advance atmosphere or the measuring process. However, the piece carries significant template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She did not simply read the slide; she listened to it" / "She measured not just amplitude or pitch, but the weight of fidelity"; "not from sadness, but from awe" / "not out of compulsion, but because chaos was the first thief"; "not in devices, but in marrow." These parallel constructions create a drumbeat rhythm that becomes predictable and dulls momentum. Figurative language is dense but controlled—"auroras trapped in glass," "frost-dusted relics," "frequencies […] in hertz and lumens"—yet lines like "some bonds defy even entropy" and "love, loyalty, or courage once burned bright enough" approach stock abstraction. The final third repeats the pattern: "not with emptiness, but with reverence" / "not in devices, but in marrow" / "walked on—toward the next slide, the next vow, the next act." While no single loop obscures causality, the cumulative effect is mechanical and reduces propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats ("The Chain was coming") alternate with longer sensory sweeps. Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems across three consecutive paragraphs, slightly dulling momentum. One paraphrase loop: "She didn't plan to fight. She planned to listen" followed immediately by "The girl edged nearer" restates intent without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat, which remains sharp and imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively. However, multiple figurative phrases cluster without clear payoff: "slow, celestial heartbeat," "terrestrially cosmic," "tuning fork struck by fate," "spiral of his storm, spiral of her doubt unraveling." The taste-progression (copper/ozone/honey) offers purposeful patterning, but the final paragraph stacks abstract terms ("trust," "nostalgia," "grace") and near-paraphrases ("already forgetting the storm, already remembering the rain") that dull closure momentum. Template cadence in the last lines ("how to heal, how to hold, how to converge") triggers a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "not from cold, but from the inescapable callings" / "the callings never ceased. They whispered…"; "corked, polite, productive" restates the faucet/tide metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the "They rise…They whispered…Then the second…Then the sketching begins" sequence. Elevated diction ("mnemonically sovereign," "auroral sorrow") in the final paragraph reads ornamental rather than propulsive. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for register drift in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, and figurative language (sky "pressed like a bruise," silence "pooled like standing water") is vivid without overwriting. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Minor issues: "She realized then" is a mild tell scaffold, and one paraphrase loop near the ending ("not for rescue, but for witness" / "someone who could bear their weight") slightly reduces propulsion. No grammar errors; clarity is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-payoff at closure, creating density drag: "vibration painted meaning too fragile for syllables," "emotional gravity aligned—a meteorology of soul," "color of wonder...that elusive hue between dawn's blush and twilight's sigh." Mixed metaphors ("wind-driven pendulums" + "glacial memory" + "ballad of vanishing cold") pile without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear: "She believed wonder had a color, and that color could be sung into being" closely restates the earlier "preserve the color of wonder...each note tuned to preserve." Template cadence runs: "She moved...her fingers brushing...to coax," "She'd pause...place her palm...and wait," "She'd smile then...with shoulders, with spine, with the tilt." Information density is low; many sentences perform one job (description) without advancing character or conflict. Rhythm remains uniform despite tonal shifts, and the closure beat ("simply stopped climbing") is summary rather than image-driven propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    High information density and purposeful figurative language (desert roses as counterweight, fears as fireflies of dread). However, several paraphrase loops and synonym variations appear: "fragmented, yes, stitched from memory and machine and fire—but whole" echoes the prior "no longer just nostalgic…whole" without added pressure. Template cadence runs: multiple "It [verb]" openings in the final third. The "strangely organic" phrase recurs as decoration rather than causal detail. Metaphor density in the burn sequence (blue flames "transmute," fears "unravel into harmless light") stays coherent but borders on saturation. Clarity remains intact; momentum occasionally slows for textural echo.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sentence openings are purposeful; information density is solid in the opening courtyard beat. However, mid-story summary compresses four mornings into two short paragraphs, flattening momentum. Minor loops: "softly, imperfectly" / "softly, tear-streaked" and "side by side" (envelope and locket, then Leo's multiple relational pairings). "The humming inside had softened, no longer broken—just sad, and seen" stacks modifiers without advancing pressure. The seashell coda feels scaffolded—an emblem rather than a propulsive beat—but clarity and grammar remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked without rest: "silt-choked glass," "static hymns," "tide-bound ghost," "slow certainty of a spider," "narrative arcs," "coded triumph," "sonar through metal and marrow" all within the opening quarter. Many metaphors shift vehicles mid-image—Elira is both tide and spider, both ghost and dancer—creating register drift that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in repeated "not X, but Y" constructions ("not shouted, not shattered," "not to flood, but to redirect," "not dead, not gone, but rewritten") and in parallel "she had" / "she didn't" / "she turned" stems. Paraphrase loops recur: paragraph six recaps the journal-encoding already stated in paragraph five; "calm defiance" and "mastery of timing" are restated across multiple beats without new detail. The final third is pervaded by these artifacts, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "gravity of reunion" and "suspended mid-cheek" in tight succession risk redundancy. "Gleaming silence" recurs as motif but could read as label-only in places. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity is maintained. The closure image—"silence gleamed"—is concise and charged. Figurative density is high but coherent, with one metaphor cluster ("salt crystals chimed...vibration that synced") slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("moonlight draped," "slithered into her dreams," "velvet void," "memory given motion"), creating persistent elevation that flattens urgency in what should be peak beats. Several paraphrase loops: "not to silence prophecies, but to hear them fully, to cradle their tremors until they found peace" restates the prior realization without new pressure. Template cadence: "not [X], but [Y]" appears in seven sentences, mechanically toggling binaries. Sentence openings vary, but information density sags under metaphor weight. Subtract baseline −0.6 for density and template runs, plus −0.3 for paraphrase in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally controlled ("meteors…painting the sky with fleeting silver scars," "lies a scaffold holding up something truer"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She wasn't dead…but dead as in retired, forgotten" restates the same idea; "her motivation, now, was quieter, stranger" summarizes what the next sentence shows. The archivist's confession block stacks exposition without scene action, dulling momentum. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she believed," "he confessed") reduce immediacy in key beats. No mixed metaphors or template cadence, but the prose does not tighten at closure—the final paragraph maintains the opening's lyric register without propulsion shift. Solid craft with scattered scaffolding that prevents entry to the 7.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("sky bled indigo," "tragically radiant," "supernovas collapsing," "silver thread unraveling") with mixed coherence: "memories go to be quarantined" by "the soul's own mercy" is evocative, but "resonance structures" and "lattices of longing" veer toward abstraction in adjacent beats without on-page dramatization. Template cadence appears in the archive sequence ("She did not flinch. She cataloged. She labeled. She archived.") and near-paraphrase loops occur ("Not healed, not whole, but sovereign" / "not locked, not buried, but structured"). Information density is moderate; some scaffold ("This was her alchemy") could compress. No major causality breaks, but elevated diction in peak beats reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and ornamental restatements. "Calibrated treason" appears three times; "as stalactites drip" recurs as a structural marker without adding pressure each time. Mixed metaphors ("ink mixed with her own tears and the powdered petal") strain clarity. Figurative language pervades high-pressure beats without always advancing action, creating drift. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses that reiterate rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "echoes were not reflections but residues" is immediately restated via the three-layer structure. Template cadence runs in the climax ("She sang of children… of lovers… of warriors"). Stock metaphors ("veins of silver," "lean closer") recur without fresh payoff. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") cluster in exposition. No major clarity breaks, but density artifacts and synonym churn ("whispers grew louder," "syllables overlapping," "harmonizing") in peak beats dull immediacy. Line-level control is adequate but not publish-ready without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the dream-cameo constellation paragraph. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not terror, but wonder" / "not to haunt, but to be seen" recurs as template negation across multiple beats (−0.4). "The ghost whisperer" is repeated as subject in adjacent sentences mid-piece where pronouns would serve (−0.2). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, dense figurative language in nearly every sentence creates texture saturation: "curled upward, scintillatingly somber, like starlight caught in a spider's thread—luminous, yet heavy with the weight of unsung labor" stacks metaphors without clarity gain. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to escape, but to witness" / "not loudly, not proudly, but with demure audacity." Adverbial intensifiers ("not literally," "earnestly") clutter peak beats. Stock phrases ("marrow of the stones," "vanished into the alleys") dull specificity. The final third carries multiple metaphor strings without propulsion, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "reassembling shredded letters" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "sharply observant" is recycled; "stillpoint" echoes across multiple lines without functional variance. Template cadence runs through the piece ("She [verb], [gerund]... She [verb], [gerund]..."). Stock metaphors ("truth became a ghost," "diamond... beat like a second heart") and filter-verb stacks ("watching as," "intuiting patterns," "cross-referencing them") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("frozen wave," "origami wings"), but multiple beats stack metaphors without rest: "nest of dials," "oracle bones," "chrome sunrise" in quick succession muddle rather than clarify. Template cadence appears: "She didn't hate him. She pitied him. His dawn was sterile…" loops without added pressure. The paraphrase "not as noise, but as invitation" echoes the prior "not betrayal, but evolution" without differentiation. Loops and synonym churn ("whisper," "murmur," "echo") recur across the piece. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; no paraphrase loops. However, several passages lean into overwriting: "fragile, trembling things sealed beneath cork and wax," "lonesome splendor—positively wistful, endlessly bright" stacks modifiers without added pressure. "He rose not to beg or barter, but to sweeten the silence—with glass jars" is a forced construction. The final poem recites the prompt elements ("gleaned redemption," "lonesome splendor," "positively wistful") in a way that feels like thematic echo rather than earned image. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is strong in the middle third but thins in the reflective blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: figurative density in nearly every sentence ("bleeding amber across fractured ice," "weaver of waves," "sonic entropy," "harmonic grace") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("not to conquer the ice, but to converse with it" / "not defensively, but forgivingly"). Template cadence: "She adapted... She descended... She turned... She didn't panic. She adapted." Stock metaphors ("fierce as a glacier's birth") and therapy-speak ("logically emotional grace") cluster in peak beats. Register drift into abstract academic diction ("mediator," "transmuting," "sonic absolution") violates the immediacy of crisis. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disqualification from 9+ and cap at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised with storm memory," "frost spreading across glass"), but multiple lines loop conceptually: "not conquest, not noise, not fire" and "not by waiting, but by witnessing; not by forcing time, but by folding" are near-paraphrases that restate rather than advance. Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun], once [X], now [Y]" across several paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("roots under stone," "fever of presence") reduce freshness. Register occasionally elevates beyond the on-page action ("unyoke," "cadence," "resonant reconfiguration" feel imposed). Rhythm varies, but information density is low; many sentences restate the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong imagery ("shadows stretch like reaching fingers," "rain greets her at street level, clean and cold") and varied syntax. Information density is high in the investigator's empirical catalog (echo decay, thermal anomalies, shoeprint alignment). However, minor scaffold persists: "she kneels," "she stands," "she walks" template cadence in the tunnel sequence; "not from indifference, but because" and "not with flame, but with silver light" repeat the not-X-but-Y structure within close proximity. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacked ("memories entangle," "knot into accidents," "silent screams in steel corridors") without breathing room. No loops that obscure causality, but cumulative drift lowers propulsion slightly in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, minor artifacts appear: "He deserved this penance—not the prison visits... but this" employs a template construction, and "Hands trembling, he realigned" is a simultaneity slip (trembling continues during alignment, acceptable). The phrase "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" is poetic but slightly ornamental in its meta-commentary. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sentences propel forward through the transliteration sequence with strong verbs and concrete nouns. However, the prose carries noticeable overwriting in figurative density: "gears interlocking mid-air like mechanical fireflies," "cities built from sighs, bells carved from silence," "a spiral shaped like a question mark made of wings." These metaphors are coherent but cluster heavily, applying −0.5. A minor paraphrase loop appears in "Not perfectly. / Not elegantly. / But irreverently, awesomely, gloriously" (template parallelism without pressure gain), applying −0.2. No loops obscure causality, so deductions remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Opening line grounds character and stakes effectively. Line-level clarity is strong in the archive-search sequence and the 07:07 climax. However, patterned artifacts appear: repeated sentence stems ("She found," "She thought," "She lied," "She didn't," "She stopped," "She is"), paraphrase loops (the crew's vanishing is restated three times in adjacent paragraphs with minor variation), and synonym churn around "deleted/scrubbed/erased/vanished." The closure paragraph uses effective fragments and repetition ("They don't go. / They linger. / They wait.") but the scaffold debt in earlier sections and the filter-verb stack ("She'd found... she saw... she thought... she knew") in mid-story accumulate to −1.0. Stock metaphor: "mist" for dissolving leads.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without variation or relief: "shadow-laced," "scar-map," "weighted breath," "courageous anomaly," "trembling on the edge of decision." This density triggers −0.5 for overwriting. Several paraphrase loops appear: "not magical, not prophetic" / "not guiding ships anymore" / "not to fix it. Not to erase the cracks." Template stems recur: "She sought... She pressed... She lifted... She tucked... She walked." Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.9. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty but scaffolding phrases ("It was slow work. The ice shifted. The lighthouse beam swept.") pad transitions. Clarity remains intact but momentum sags under metaphor weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is dense without obscuring causality. Strong lines: "a low, wet chime, like a bell submerged in deep water"; "patience folding inward, finally at rest." Friction: the opening three paragraphs loop conceptually (woke changed, hollow eyes, gripping reality loosely) without advancing situation; "silt" / "slush" / "wind and frost like a ghost's breath" stack metaphors in close succession. Template stems appear mid-piece ("She'd come to…," "She realized then…"). Penultimate paragraph over-explains the thematic turn. Deduction: −0.6 for loops and stem repetition, partial recovery for closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is mostly clean with strong sensory anchors ("crunch of fallen leaves," "woodsmoke clinging to her coat"). Figurative density increases under pressure without becoming opaque, though "souls orbiting the same sun but never touching" and "fertile, intentional, alive" in quick succession approach overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "that's why we failed" / "that's why we mattered" structure recurs later as "keepsake of what was lost" / "map of what could still grow" without added pressure. Rhythm varies; sentence openings show variety. Template cadence appears briefly in the vineyard-row exposition ("how the Merlot vines... how the soil shifted"), a minor drag. No clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is polished but marred by repetitive stems and paraphrase loops: "She did not force… She did not command. She simply remained"; "not of sound, but of essence. / Not the prophet's voice, but the silence that followed it." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("Each clearing was shaped…," "One by one, more clearings formed…"). Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "like smoke clinging to rafters," "like a bird in a thornless branch." High-register diction ("consecration," "parapet," "sanctity") is consistent but edges toward purple without propulsion. Information density is low; many sentences restate the ritual's mechanics without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She placed... then withdrew," "More photographs... More arcs... More silences" creates mechanical parallelism. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-focus beats without pattern payoff (density penalty −0.5). Stock metaphors ("stubborn hope," "quiet magic") and elevated diction ("transmute," "alchemy") clash with scene immediacy (register drift −0.4). Sentence openings recycle "She [verb]" across a dozen lines (template cadence −0.5). Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many sentences do double duty, but figurative language appears densely without always advancing pressure: "silence pooled like ink," "breath... folding into itself like origami," "spiraling into the rafters, where they tangled with the ghosts." Mid-story, metaphor density slows momentum. Minor loops: "not to resurrect, but to understand" / "not with triumph, but with the weathered innocence" share parallel structure that becomes template-like. No major clarity breaks, but the overwriting caps the high band. Opening and closing lines are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("fog sculpture garden," "driftwood arranged like broken compass needles," "static between VHS tracks," "sandpaper dragged across velvet," "syrup poured in slow motion") but the pattern is taught early and consistent with the lyric-accumulative mode, so no overwriting penalty applies. Some template cadence appears in the middle section: "He knelt... He pressed... He dragged..." (three sequential "He [verb]" stems) triggers −0.4 in Q7. Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He wept. Not because he recognized the tune—he didn't—but because its decay felt like his own" embodies both emotion and theme). No paraphrase loops or clarity-obscuring artifacts touch the closure beat. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives punctuating longer lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "not to freeze time, but to restructure it" / "not by thrust, but by tenderness; not by breaking free, but by becoming weightless" recur as template parallelism without added pressure (−0.6). Figurative density is high across most sentences ("luminous ache," "boiling clouds," "filaments of starlight," "mosaic of moments") without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in peak beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: time "braided" then becomes "lattice," then "flow" without coherent vehicle (−0.4). Stock opener "She remembered" introduces backstory. Total artifacts in Q7: −1.5 baseline, touching closure area raises to −1.7.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys figurative language ("cloud-light," "incense," "filament," "motes," "honey on warm toast, salt on a lover's skin") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty. Multiple paraphrase loops: "not grand requiems…but the ordinary turned sacred" restated across three consecutive sentences. Template cadence in the hymn catalog ("the squeak…the rustle…the clink…the sigh"). Figurative muddle: "scent of hope…could be tasted—like honey…like salt" mixes vehicles. Penalty: −1.2 in Q7 for density + loops + mixed metaphors; artifacts touch closure ("motes of light"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("a spoon that never hit the ground—it simply ceased existing mid-fall") and strong concrete nouns. However, figurative density runs high throughout ("barnacle," "tide against cliff," "serpent swallowing its own tail," "tuning fork tuned to forgotten frequencies," "liquid night"), creating a textural saturation that risks numbing impact in peak beats. Several paraphrase loops appear: the key "didn't open locks. It opened thresholds" is restated multiple times, and "quietly deliberate" recurs as a label without fresh variation. Template cadence ("She recorded. She measured. She noted") appears once but is brief. Sentence openings vary well. No severe clarity breaks, but the density and minor loops prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully; information density is high. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without taught pattern or payoff, creating cumulative overwriting (−0.5). Phrases like "shrewdly innocent," "nostalgic innovation," and "quiet architecture of redemption" feel ornamental rather than propulsive. Some paraphrase loops exist ("not to undo the past, but to recompose it" / "not as a monument, but as a marker"). No major scaffold or template cadence, but the cumulative density in peak beats (tooth placement, final walk) slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is often specific (agate burnishers, powdered cerium, seafoam greens). Yet figurative saturation peaks in the first and final thirds (dragons, tides, pearls, windows) without clear pattern-teaching, and several lines paraphrase across adjacent beats ("not to curse the absence, but to learn how stillness could hold its own glow" → "a pearl of stillness"). The closure paragraph includes mild scaffold ("not conquest / not correction / but polishing") and a metaphor stack that dilutes rather than sharpens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. However, figurative density is high throughout—"cathedral of decay," "honeyed hush," "stitching from frayed threads," "veil swallow the words"—without pattern-teaching or purposeful sparseness in peak beats, creating a steady lyric wash that flattens propulsion (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't burn it. She placed it gently…" followed by "not to erase them, but to transform them" restates the same gesture (−0.2). Momentum drag accumulates across reflective blocks that do not alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmosphere work without advancing choice or knowledge. Template cadence appears in the cameo sequence ("A boy... A soldier... A dancer...") −0.4. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent, though "mist curled around it like fingers tucking in a child" and "dawn bruising the horizon" risk stock imagery. The paraphrase loop "not to write, but to solemnize... not to replicate... not to escape, but to begin again" adds −0.2. Rhythm varies purposefully in places but flattens during the catalog of cameos. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high, but repetitive syntactic patterns accumulate: "Not with her voice, but through..." "Not fables, but truths..." "Not from outside, but from within..." "Not in spectacle, but in surrender..." This parallelism reads as deliberate patterning but becomes template-like across the full piece, triggering −0.4 for template-cadence in high-density runs. Stock metaphors appear ("velvet over stone," "mist under morning sun") without fresh transformation. Information density is good; no paraphrase loops or major scaffolding. The overwriting check flags figurative language in most sentences of key beats (the playing sequence, the apparition emergence) without cost or pattern-teaching payoff, applying −0.5 for density and coherence drift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic layering. While the prose is evocative, the relentless lyricism flattens momentum in a piece with minimal escalation. Several lines paraphrase the same concept (patience, silence, waiting) without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm is controlled, but information density suffers under decorative weight. "Flash-paper" is mentioned early and late but never used, a setup without payoff. Minor pronoun ambiguity in "she saw it: a map drawn in pulses" (referent slightly delayed). No major loops, but the cumulative ornamental load dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is densely figurative with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("frost clung like regret," "light as his scribe, angles as his syntax"). However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction, creating a uniform lyric register that flattens urgency—crisis and calm read identically ornate. Paraphrase loops appear ("not a failure but a fulcrum" echoes earlier reframings), and synonym churn surfaces in the closing paragraph ("glimmers"/"resonance," "bread"/"wine"). The final third's summary mode introduces template cadence ("They'd leave... whisper... unaware") that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "drowned fireflies," "whale ribs arching over empty seas," "seashell whorls," "leviathan heartbeat." In the climactic lamp-lighting sequence, metaphors stack without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "The pattern spiraled outward, recursive and infinite, folding sorrow into symmetry until the burden began to calcify—not vanish, but settle, compact, become something manageable" restates the same content three times. Register is consistently elevated but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tessellating lattices," "magnetic seam") without POV anchoring. No major artifacts touch closure, but density throughout flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual breathing room. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Two deductions: (1) Paraphrase loop at "She wasn't sculpting memory; she was trying to contain it" followed immediately by similar phrasing about spillage (~−0.3). (2) Stock metaphor "fine as a lion's whisker" and "watery gold" are competent but not fresh (~−0.2). The kettle's escalation (slow song → whistle → scream → click) is purposeful and propulsive. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "rust-hued peace settling like dust" works, though the piece nears the threshold where metaphor frequency in contemplative beats could dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (setting, interiority, metaphor). A few micro-loops appear: "I regret trusting... I regret not asking... Most of all, I regret believing" stacks parallel structures without added pressure, and "She doesn't speak in words, you see" introduces a conversational filter that slightly distances. The final sequence's propulsion is strong ("A flash — weak, sputtering — bursts like a dying star"), but the envelope's one-sentence wisdom and the ghost's dissolution compress complex closure into summary beats that sacrifice scene momentum for thematic neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and varied sentence rhythm in technical beats ("cannibalized conduit housings…welded them with scavenged plasma torches"), but template cadence appears in mid-story description: "She installed…She wrote…She packed" runs create mechanical rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear ("not through brute force or sentimentality, but through redirected flows" / "Hope wasn't a destination; it was a flow—redirected, repurposed, resilient") that restate concepts without added pressure. The metaphor "maze of intentions" is invoked repeatedly but never physically constrains a choice, weakening its concreteness. Clarity remains high and no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; sentences layer image, character thought, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies and propels without sluggishness. However, figurative density approaches overwriting in peak beats: "silence wasn't absence, but presence thick as velvet," "time pooled like mercury," "notes…ghosts that stirred when the wind sighed." Three adjacent metaphor vehicles (mercury, velvet, liquid sun) in the opening risks coherence drift. Stock phrases appear: "hin of a hidden sunrise," "petrichor nostalgia." Paraphrase loop between "He bore no grudge against the silence" and "It didn't judge his silence" costs ~0.3. No major scaffold, but density and stock phrasing prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("architecture of lies" is extended purposefully; "serene upheaval" recurs). However, runs of near-parallel constructions appear: "not to hunt, but to listen; not to chase, but to wait"; "not fish, not current, but intention"; "not magic, not fate, but physics"; "not proof, but peace." This template cadence becomes mechanical across multiple beats, dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: the final two paragraphs restate the seeker's settled, no-longer-lost state with synonym variation ("settled," "peace," "no longer lost, but found") without adding pressure. Information density is high; grammar is clean. Applying template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and paraphrase loop (−0.2) within Q7 only, baseline ~7.1 → 6.4.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, but the piece carries noticeable scaffold: multiple sentences begin with "She" or "He" in adjacent beats, and some lines restate content without added pressure ("not through lecture, but through silence and gesture, letting her mimic, fail, and try again" feels list-like). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every paragraph includes metaphor or simile—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. The phrase "coax meaning from hemp and memory" and "sleeping serpent of wisdom" are vivid but verge on overwriting. Information density is moderate; some beats (the list of knot names) feel decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with lyric compression in fragments like "Not magic. Memory, yes—but also resonance" and "Tomorrow, someone else would find it." Figurative language is dense—"valleys of absence," "ocean still trapped inside," "horizon forgets to end"—but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two distinct issues: (a) paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("not to mourn death, but to map the spaces where presence once bloomed" restated as "obituaries were an act of intimate cartography, stitching grief into grammar"), and (b) the stock metaphor "ink bleeding like old wounds" in a high-pressure beat feels generic. Filter-verb usage is light and acceptable. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds, though the middle paragraph summarizing the traveler's method dips into expository summary. Proofreading is clean, and the final line propels closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"velvet tunic frayed and stained," "crown dented like a crushed beetle shell," "mineral tears," "marrow of his marrow," "unsung hymn," "honey laced with salt"—creating cumulative overwriting in a high-pressure climax where clarity would serve better. Several metaphors border on mixed: "quaking reverie" applied to chandeliers, "bitterly sweet, like honey laced with salt, like reunion shadowed by loss" stacks vehicles. Template cadence appears: "He worked by hypothesizing… He installed… He calibrated… He closed his eyes and hypothesized aloud" runs a repeated stem across key beats. Paraphrase loop: "Not from the egg. Not yet. But from the air itself" restates the prior line's implication. No major clarity breaks, but density and loops reduce propulsion at closure. Applying −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop; cumulative artifact cap at −1.2 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("kelp-drift peace," "tide-pulled kelp," "watercolor tattoo"). However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "not to fix, not to bury, but to listen" and "not in spite of their depth, but because of it" employ parallel negation that becomes template cadence. The climactic beat—"The coin dips below the surface, thread taut, and the lagoon hums. A low, resonant note..."—stacks two sentences restating the same hum without added pressure. Minor filter-verb cluster: "She doesn't flinch. She leans forward." Clarity is never obscured, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports the lyric-textural mode, but density issues appear: "She believed in the realistically imaginative: the plausible miracle, the scientific ghost, the psychological haunting that bent reality just enough to let truth slip through" reads as a catalog that paraphrases rather than advancing pressure. Several beats ("not glow, but clarity," "not absence, but presence") rely on oppositional formula. The final third maintains clarity and the drop image is clean, so artifacts do not touch closure, but template cadence and near-synonym loops ("forgotten," "neglect," "silence" recur decoratively) reduce propulsion in the middle. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 density penalty). Mixed metaphors appear: "cathedral of gas" / "nebular orchids" / "lighthouse without flame" stack vehicles without coherent tenor. Paraphrase loops: "This is what we carried / This is what broke us / This is what we mend" and "sonar pinging" repeated across beats without added detail (−0.4 template cadence). Information density is low; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Artifacts touch closure ("You do not need to burn"), disallowing 9+ globally per the cap.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is dense and specific. However, several lines loop conceptually: "not to recite but to feel the weight each word bore" is restated in "syllable by syllable, stanza by stanza"; "he carved names he'd never met" is followed by a near-paraphrase "epitaphs for strangers." The phrase "the gravestone carver, Elias Voss" front-loads apposition where "Elias Voss carved gravestones" would be leaner. Figurative language is controlled but dense in every paragraph without clear pattern-teaching, risking over-decoration. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deductions at −0.8 under the non-closure rule.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language is dense throughout ("salt-wind howling through the tidal obsidian ridge like a dirge," "heavier than guilt, smoother than forgiveness," "tongue of liquid night") with little rhythmic breathing room; peak beats stack metaphors without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "incremental absolution" is explained three times across paragraphs in near-synonym phrasing. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" or "[Noun] [verb]" without variation. Information density is high but some lines (e.g., "its black glass surface slick with brine and memory") privilege texture over advancement. The closure beat is legible but the surrounding prose obscures momentum with ornamental layering, triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm is controlled and imagery is vivid, but density issues accumulate. Several lines restate the same content: "not to repair, but to reveal" echoes "untangle...by decoding"; "centuries of stifled yearning exhaled at once" paraphrases the earlier "hollow hum beneath her ribs." Stock metaphors appear: "riot of frayed threads," "velvet gloom." The prose is clear and legible, yet multiple beats lean into ornamental description without advancing plot or character. Filter-verb clusters ("didn't fear," "didn't know," "no longer saw") dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dense figurative language pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "ignorance cartographer," "territories of ignorance where innovation hides, curled like frost inside hollow reeds," "living threads of causality, branching like roots beneath frozen soil." Mixed/competing metaphors (threads branch like roots; innovation curls like frost) reduce clarity (−0.5). Template cadence in the glyph sequence: "The first stroke… The second stroke… By the seventh glyph…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 9–10 restate "constraints focus innovation" without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high but propulsion stalls in the middle third under the weight of ornamental description. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping cumulative deduction at −1.1 and preventing the Text-Artifact floor from applying.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but controlled: "mist curling at the threshold like a sigh," "moth-wing thread," "thistled calm." However, the piece carries paraphrase loops ("not just melody, but meaning" / "not just play; they summoned") and template cadence in the lyric-listing sequences ("a child's lullaby lost in war, a sailor's last toast..."). The opening paragraph front-loads four metaphors in rapid succession without pattern-teaching, and the final broadcast lyric ("The copyist weeps in measured time / and wakes the dust with dotted rhyme") reads as thematic echo rather than embodied pressure. Information density is high, but scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "She realized") summarize rather than dramatize key turns. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction at −0.8 under the non-closure accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and vivid sensory anchors ("powder settles like snowfall on charcoal, clinging to the ridges of cheekbones"). Information density is high; most sentences advance image or character. However, the piece carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "She does not paint completion. She paints absence" immediately restates in the following dash-clause list; "The mirage of safety fades. What remains is truth" in the final paragraph loops the core assertion. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She does not turn… She replies… She allows it"). The closing paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("carefully woven, imperfectly held, gloriously, somberly real") that reduce concrete propulsion at closure. Baseline deduction −0.8 in Q7 for loops and scaffold touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and momentum steady, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or thematic layering. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately (shorter beats during the bell-tower ritual, longer during cataloging). However, pervasive figurative density and elevated diction ("inverted archive," "sedimentary layers," "saboteur of assumptions," "calibrated silence") approach overwriting in several high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching, though the pieces remain legible. Minor template cadence in the parallel "He [verb]" structures (spat/wiped/returned; placed/whispered) and slight synonym churn around "quiet/silent/abrasive calm" lower the score. The final paragraph's clean parallelism (Above/Below, Council/him) rescues closure clarity. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift; grammar is clean. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in early paragraphs (rosette, velvet, autumn) but sags in the middle third with synonym loops ("not bitter, not hopeful, but present"; "not to perfect pitch, but to feel the vibration") and paraphrase across adjacent lines. Stock phrases appear: "the kind of quiet that denoted presence, not absence," "a single breathing instrument," "harmony was never lost. Only waiting." Filter verbs ("she remembered," "she discovered") stack in reflective passages without voice necessity. The final image is clear and propulsive, but template cadence ("not X, not Y, but Z") recurs four times, triggering a −0.6 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally high, but the piece carries noticeable text-pattern artifacts: paraphrase loops ("not to overthrow, but to reweave; not to burn the greenhouse down, but to let new light in"), template parallelism in multiple beats, and stock metaphors ("archives," "threads"). The phrase "synaptic plasticity" appears three times without varied context. Information density is uneven—some beats do double work (tasting memories while pruning), but others summarize without advancing pressure ("By dawn, the sprout had grown six inches"). The final third recaps theme rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high—sentences multi-task (e.g., "She didn't pay. Instead, she placed a matchbox..."). Opening line anchors voice and constraint cleanly. Minor loops: "They're not broken... They're waiting" and "They're not pollinators anymore... They're capacitors" are effective but lean on parallel template stems. "Nectar dusk" in the final paragraph feels slightly ornamental rather than earned by prior sensory work. No major clarity issues, but a few phrases ("her earlier urgency tempered by awe," "faint blue flickers syncing") approach stock metaphor without fresh embodiment. Propulsion remains strong through peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("silence pooled like spilled ink," "houses...their doorframes leaning like old friends"). Two issues: the final two paragraphs loop conceptually, restating intent across adjacent lines ("keep walking, keep noticing, keep sanctifying" then "she would find another object...place it where it didn't belong"). Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("She knelt...placed...closed...pressed"). These artifacts dull momentum in the closure zone, triggering −0.4 to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("marble skin humming," "scalpel dipped in honey," "sugar in tea"). However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "foxglove-stained glass ampoule," "moss-furred shoulder," "kelp on stone," "cascading revelations," "animate lifelessness" stack elevated diction without always advancing urgency. Template-cadence runs appear in the mid-section ("Not collapse, but transformation. Not failure, but choice. Not one fall, but many") and create rhythmic predictability. The ampoule is described as "foxglove-stained" at introduction and "violet dye swirling like captured dusk" three lines later—near-synonym churn. The closure beat's dissolution ("like sugar in tea," "plankton, whispering") is vivid but the preceding paragraph's thematic summary ("Not of ruins, but of rebirth. Not of endings, but of thresholds") loops the parallel structure one beat too many, dulling momentum into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify, and information density is high (each paragraph advances image, stake, or insight). However, several lines loop conceptually: "the texture of that missed opportunity" recurs in near-synonyms ("grain of what might have been," "captured texture," "humid press of a future unlived"), and template cadence appears in the middle ("He didn't mind. The act mattered more than the artifact. Each proof was a rupture..."). Stock metaphor strings ("wound of his indecision," "shell of what he'd accepted") in peak beats and filter-verb reliance ("he'd believed," "he'd tried," "he remembered") dull immediacy. The overwriting is controlled but pervasive enough to prevent high-band entry; apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting strain in the opening: "smog-choked city offered none," "pooled like spilled ink," "glass panes streaked with soot and stubborn dew" stack figurative density without pattern-teaching. Multiple sentences open with "She + verb" ("She believed," "She worked," "She painted," "She smiled," "She kept painting"), creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "not for air…but for silence" and "less a sanctuary and more a confession booth" restate texture without advancing pressure. Information density is high in the brush and glyph mechanics, but the figurative load and repetitive stems dull propulsion in the first third. No causality break, so penalties remain in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful in most beats, creating vivid images like "emerald-tinted opera glass lens" and "mnemonic architecture, edible archives." However, several sentences loop or restate without added pressure: "The bread was more than sustenance—it was mnemonic architecture, edible archives" immediately follows the previous paragraph's detailed bread-letter ritual, paraphrasing rather than advancing. Template cadence appears in the catalog of performances near the end ("children singing in rounds, elders dancing with canes, bread shaped like musical notes"). The opening beekeeper reference is elegant but never paid off, leaving scaffold. Minor density loss and one paraphrase loop in a non-closure beat warrant modest penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is syntactically varied and commits to a lyric register with moments of strong imagery ("petals of obsidian unfolding," "cold. Alive."). However, heavy overwriting in high-pressure beats undermines momentum: "latent radiance bloomed—not light, but presence, a glow that cast no shadow yet bent perception" stacks metaphors without clarifying the phenomenon. Paraphrase loops appear ("The moment he lifted it free, the latent radiance surged outward" after "latent radiance bloomed"), and several beats rely on stock poetic constructions ("coiled around him like smoke," "threads... snapping like over-tuned violin strings"). Template cadence in the climax ("The ground trembled. / The lighthouse beam... stuttered... / He felt fate's design strain... / Memories... flooded in... / He gritted his teeth.") flattens propulsion. Figurative density in most sentences of the stone-opening sequence (−0.5) and paraphrase loops (−0.4) compound to material line-level debt.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated diction ("vibration, the kind that makes molars ache," "toxic film negatives," "hues of bile and twilight"), creating density without corresponding information gain. Paraphrase loops appear (the clasp's description is repeated across multiple beats with synonym variation; "lingering luminance" is defined, then re-explained). Template cadence in the confrontation sequence: "It recoiled... The luminance burned... 'You're… me,' it whispered... Its form began to dissolve" follows mechanical action-reaction-dialogue beats. Filter-verb stacks ("I clutched," "I flipped," "I gasped," "I held") flatten immediacy in high-pressure moments. The final-paragraph artifacts ("no longer cursed, no longer hunted—just unbosomed, luminous, and finally awake") summarize rather than image the transformation, undercutting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor and synesthesia ("sound could be drawn like charcoal," "visible as a golden helix") nearly every sentence. While the pattern is taught early, peak beats layer vehicles without clarity gain: "emotional timbre," "resonant imprinting," "audible geometry" stack without grounding. Paraphrase appears: "not from wind, but from subsonic pulses" echoes "not with water, but with sound." Template stems recur: "The Prophet [verb]" across multiple beats. No loops touch closure directly, capping deduction at −0.8, but density and register drift lower the band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high: most lines serve character, world, or pressure simultaneously. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm breathes with the scene's needs. Minor template cadence appears in the middle section ("She'd spent… She theorized… She'd cracked…") but does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. One paraphrase loop: "Enough to confirm / Enough to prove" adds emphasis rather than churn. No metaphor muddle or register drift; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with vivid images ("ivy strangling the iron beams," "roots cracking through the platform's concrete like veins of forgotten time"). However, the final third shifts into expository summary with repetitive sentence stems: "She'd write… She'd speak… And when the skeptics called…" This future-tense scaffold flattens momentum and dulls the closure beat. The extended reflection on noble lies, while thematically rich, loops conceptually without advancing scene pressure. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "archives could bleed" and "lantern in a hurricane" verge on stock metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful: "ghosts around her ankles," "teeth in a slack jaw," "sleeping serpent." Some metaphors border on overwrought ("chandeliers now crusted barnacle-crowns dangling above silent waltzes") but remain legible. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports pacing. Minor scaffold appears in repeated syntactic stems ("She carried," "She wrested," "She found," "She copied") across the middle third, creating mild template cadence that does not obscure causality but dulls immediacy slightly. No paraphrase loops or clarity failures at closure. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with vivid imagery (kelp, silt, bone stylus) and varied syntax. However, persistent filter verbs ("she knew," "she found," "she noticed") and synonym loops ("stillness reclaimed," "stillness had been reclaimed," "reclaimed stillness") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase cycles appear: "not just facts, but the weight of..." echoes earlier "not by chance, but by design" and "not to condemn, but to witness." Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "not X, but Y" constructions and "she [verb]" stems. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, applying the −1.7 artifact deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but coherent within the lyric mode. Several template cadences appear: "He'd tried to transform… but it always returned," "not as a thief, but as a mirror," "not downward, not upward, but sideways." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3 (shadow detached → retreated to isle → glass basilica rises) restates location without advancing pressure. The sapphire striking "not with a crack, but a chord" and the crane "not to rise, but to hold the air still" are elegant parallelisms but push into overwriting at the closure beat. No major opacity or confusion, but density without propulsion in the opening third costs momentum. Line-level control is strong; no grammar or continuity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and many lines carry dual function (e.g., "the geode throbbed...as if holding the memory of a universe that chose differently" advances both object and theme). Clarity is generally high, but patterned overwriting clusters in the first half: "intangibly tangible—a paradox she could feel in her bones," "whispering in frequencies only trauma-tuned nerves could interpret," and "threading equations through grief like sutures through flesh" stack figurative language without rest, creating density drag (−0.6). A paraphrase loop appears: "She wasn't mad. Not anymore. Madness implied chaos; she operated in calibrated desperation" restates the same stance across adjacent lines without pressure gain (−0.2). The closure beat is clean—"The stars bent" and "the observatory leapt into the dark" propel without muddle—partially offsetting non-closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Paraphrase appears once ("It was never out there" / "It was in the pull") and conceptual redundancy surfaces in the final paragraphs where "belonging wasn't a signal" and "resonance" are restated. Filter verbs ("her breath catching," "she saw") appear but remain voice-motivated. No severe loops or template cadence; clarity and momentum hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and imagery is often striking ("truth strained through grain and tide"), but the piece carries heavy overwriting in high-pressure beats: "sacrifice," "vomited into the surf, salt and bile mingling," and "tempered regret" stack metaphor and abstraction densely without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "not to deceive / Not to escape" and "Not for profit / Not for penance" recycle structure without adding pressure. The final third ("She walked until…") extends closure with repetitive syntactic stems and abstraction ("understanding was the only compass") where image alone would suffice. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she now knew") dull immediacy. Template cadence and elevated diction in peak beats trigger cumulative deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and lyric; sentence openings vary. However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "moon phases," "furrowed hush," "synchronizing," "seeds neither had dared plant alone." Mixed metaphors appear: "mist swallowing" and "wind stitching silence" operate in adjacent beats without coherent vehicle. Template cadence in the final third: repeated "They [verb]" and "No [noun]" constructions. Information density is moderate; many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (every line advances character or atmosphere). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "She didn't need perfect stars. / She needed imperfect motion." and "She wasn't broken anymore. / She was becoming." compress emotional turns into parallel declarations without fresh imagery. Filter-verb stacks ("She didn't look back," "She didn't need it to point north") and synonym churn ("collapsed expectations," "shattered," "broken beyond recalibration") dull immediacy in multiple beats. Figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("regret had magnetized the air," "backlash of regrets... pinned her"), and the final third carries several loops that reduce propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent lines in closure beats warrant −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Imagery is often vivid ("face mapped with scars that looked like subway routes"), but several sentences loop or paraphrase: "They'd undergone the procedure—memory excision, voluntary, brutal—and emerged hollow" restates rather than advances. Template-cadence runs appear ("They knelt…They pulled…They didn't turn"). Overwriting clusters in early paragraphs with stacked metaphors and near-synonym churn ("fractured by ripples that whispered"). The closure beat is cleaner, though "glowing, quiet, and fiercely alive in the dark" stacks modifiers without concrete anchoring. Paragraph cut test: some transit and archive exposition could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("wind through canyon flutes," "smoke serpents," "ember-feathers and starlight eyes"), creating density without corresponding causal propulsion. Paraphrase loops abound: "not grief, nor vengeance, but something quieter, hungrier" / "not fear, not excitement, but the quiet certainty"; "not to command, but to remember" / "not to choke, but to lift"; "not by force, but by faith; not by breaking, but by bending." Template negation stems recur across six distinct beats, flattening rhythm (−0.6). The closure beat ("not out of the orchard, but into its deeper truth") continues the pattern, dulling the final image (−0.3 additional). Stock metaphor strings ("pulsed brighter," "cradles seeds") and therapy-speak inflections ("surrendered—not to loss, but to reciprocity") further reduce precision. Apply −1.2 total in Q7 for patterned artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is lyric and imagistic but suffers from density overload and paraphrase loops. "Lost time did not vanish—it ascended" and "not to bury, but to remember" and "not to reclaim, but to bless" create a repetitive "not X, but Y" template cadence across multiple beats. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, muddling high-pressure moments: "spectral hands," "vapor," "amber air," "shimmering," "silver mist" stack without clear referents. Adjacent lines restate: "lost time did not vanish—it ascended" is immediately followed by explanation of the same concept. Register drifts into abstract elevation ("transmute regret into grace") that clashes with concrete ritual action. Artifacts touch closure ("sealed not by glue, but by surrender"), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and −1.2 deduction for template runs and opacity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high but largely coherent (tears crystallized into light, impossibility as wound, rage as anchor). Sentence rhythm varies and paragraphs modulate length purposefully. Minor scaffold appears: "Each photo held... each tear" and "Her motivation was neither... but reunion" follow template parallelism, and "she sang—an old lullaby her mother never got to finish—her voice trembling but clear" uses em-dash filter construction during a peak beat that could be more immediate. The closure sequence maintains momentum, but the mist-dissolving locket in the final beat feels like a soft exit rather than a charged final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "She opened... she released... she received" recurs without added pressure; "whispering hush" is restated as "vibrant hush" then "deepened... fuller" across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative language stacks in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching ("velvet stage for silent miracles," "schools of silver fish," "sugar in warm tea"), creating density that obscures rather than propels. Template cadence ("She opened the fourth bottle. The bug inside didn't move. She waited.") flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("tears evaporated... turning instead to mist") and therapy-speak ("fear was a luxury") dull specificity in peak beats, triggering cumulative artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and opening stems shift across paragraphs, avoiding template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: "The revolution required patience" (¶9) restates the opening's "vigilant... humming with latent purpose" thematically without added pressure; the lines between "cradle of sparks" (¶10) and "Just the cradle of sparks, gently rocked" (¶21) recycle the phrase as a thematic refrain rather than advancing action—apply −0.2 for conceptual redundancy. Stock elevated diction in peak beats ("fingers tracing the grooves," "sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies," "the cradle of sparks, gently rocked") leans on poetic ornament where concrete action would sharpen momentum. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance choice. No major clarity breaks, but propulsion softens in the long middle passage (¶6–18) where the mechanics are recounted without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and several sentences perform multiple jobs (e.g., "She'd promised him understanding before she vanished into the salt fog, a lingering promise he'd carried like a stone in his chest ever since" layers motive, memory, and emotional state). However, the piece suffers from mild overwriting: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries figurative language ("liquid mercury," "living mandala," "silent syntax"), creating density without corresponding escalation. A paraphrase loop appears ("the patterns weren't meant to be solved like riddles, but harnessed like reins" / "not to control the eels, but to align"). Opening and closing lines are strong; no loops or scaffold elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: "rarefied her grief," "oracle of ink and bone," "chorus of exiled muses," "quartz fractured to reveal its inner fire." In peak beats (timer reaches zero, final window scene) the metaphor stacking continues unabated, dulling propulsion. Mixed register: "darkroom timer" and "bus timetable" sit beside "cartography of wounds" and "suspended between heaven and oblivion." Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "not endpoints but waypoints, not wounds but coordinates." Paraphrase loop: "The vigil was in pause" restated as "The vigil in pause was not waiting." Clarity remains intact, but density and loops reduce momentum. Information density is moderate; many sentences elaborate a single image without advancing situation or choice. Applying density penalty (−0.5), loop/scaffold (−0.4), and register drift (−0.3) within Q7 only, total deduction ~−1.2.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is high in the sundial-and-cipher beats, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("prismatic shards," "herald of the hidden overture," "symphony tuned to the tension," "shadow's silent song," "counterpoint"), creating textural density that slows rather than propels. Template cadence appears in repeated "The…" and "He…" sentence openings across the first third. Paraphrase loops: "not to argue, but to fence—not with steel, but with silences" and "diplomatically fierce: never cruel, never loud, but unyielding" restate concepts without adding pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap holds penalties to −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but metaphor saturation in the opening third risks overwriting ("burrs in her coat lining," "beauty could sprout in the cracks of anarchy"). Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "He'd shown her... He'd taught her..." runs across multiple sentences without variation. Paraphrase loops cluster around "rebuild" and "molt" language—"another molt begun, not by calendar but by grief" closely echoes the opening premise without advancing pressure. The candle/seeds/song sequence is propulsive, but the "by dawn, someone would find" paragraph abstracts momentum into summary rather than staying in present action. No causality breaks, but the scaffold and density issues prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language ("ripples across the cloud-sea," "jagged shadows through the arbor's lattice," "threads of starlight from below the clouds"), triggering −0.5 for density without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors: "fate was a meticulous archivist" filing "deviations" under "anomalies to be corrected" clashes with "She composed around its edges, slipped between its ledger lines"—fate shifts from filing cabinet to musical staff without coherent vehicle. Register drift: "bureaucrat of causality" and "emotional coordinates" are academic abstractions outside a crisis POV. Template cadence in the buildup: "She played faster. / Not with desperation, but precision... / Each note was a calculated risk... / The broken anniversary clock began to tick..." uses parallel stems across four consecutive beats, applying −0.4. Paraphrase loop: "The flickering compass materialized" / "The flickering compasses—now a constellation" restates without adding pressure, −0.2. Total artifact deduction −1.1 in Q7. Figurative muddle in the climax (the chord that "shatters" the horizon "into dawn" while the reel "burst into flame, harmless and bright") obscures causality, but the closure image lands legibly enough to avoid routing the break to Q2. Information density is high but momentum drags under ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    **Overwriting and patterned artifacts** pervade: figurative density is high throughout (opal petals, liquid metaphors, star-drunk, luminous doubt), reducing clarity in peak beats. **Template cadence** appears in the opening paragraphs (repeated "He had" constructions). **Paraphrase loops**: "doubt, luminous and sharp, pricked him" is restated conceptually in the next sentence. **Filter-verb stacks** ("felt it too," "saw villages forget") dull immediacy. The climactic beat (seed splits, fractal ridge emerges) is vivid but surrounded by scaffold ("not into sprout, but into…"). Applying **−0.8 baseline** for spread artifacts, escalated to **−1.2** because overwriting touches the closure sequence. The final third's lush diction disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is densely figurative with vivid imagery ("salt-laced wind combing through wet grass," "indigo bleeding upward, swirling like ink in milk"), but the metaphor density is high throughout, risking overwriting in peak beats. Several paraphrase loops: "remorse" restated as "regret pooled thickest," "diffuse" echoed as "gently scatter" and "redistributed." Template cadence in the ritual sequence ("He placed... He turned... He found... Kneeling again...") flattens momentum. The closing "breathe" echoes the opening "breathed," creating a purposeful frame, but scaffolding dulls mid-section propulsion.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely free of scaffolding or loops; nearly every sentence adds character, atmosphere, or theme. Imagery is clear and often striking (“greenhouse creak like a ship hull,” “time as texture”) without devolving into muddled metaphor. There is some reliance on abstract summary (“civilizations eroded grain by grain; even love decayed…”) that could be sharpened into more scene-bound texture. Overall, rhythm and clarity stay strong, but a slight essayistic sheen in places keeps it just shy of top-band line work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, interiority, theme) with high information density, and repetition is used as deliberate patterning rather than filler. The figurative language is rich but mostly controlled and coherent (frost as filigree, ledger as testament, canyon as secret), avoiding mixed metaphors. A few lines approach purple or overtly epigrammatic, but they don’t obscure sense or dull the closure image, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding phrases. Pacing remains fluid, with paragraph breaks and sentence length shifts aligned to emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Laughter, fossilized in frost” is emblematic: compact, precise, and resonant). There is some density of figurative language—ice as song, warmth as music, silence as fabric—that edges toward lush, but it remains largely coherent and pattern-consistent rather than purple. Repetition is mostly purposeful (lists like “Love. Loss. Longing.”) and creates cadence rather than drag, and there’s no major scaffolding or synonym-churn. A slight trimming of explicit restatements of the core idea could heighten propulsion, but clarity and rhythm are never seriously compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are generally precise, multi-purpose, and propel both mood and meaning (“ink bleeding into whispers of forgotten law and drowned poetry”). The prose sustains a dense lyricism without major metaphor clashes or confusion, and paragraphs mostly avoid redundancy. There is some risk of overrichness (stacked metaphors, repeated cadences like “Not a grave. / Not a marker.”), but these feel intentional and rhythmically effective rather than scaffolding. Information is compact, with few lines that could be cut without losing atmosphere or thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “bruised twilight” and “hunger followed like a shadow” are vivid without stacking into purple prose, and most sentences carry more than one job. Rhythm varies well between longer, flowing descriptive lines and tighter, declarative ones at turns (“The sound was enough.”). There are no noticeable scaffolding loops, mixed metaphors, or clarity issues, and the closing sentences land cleanly. Information density and momentum are high for a quiet, lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is unusually polished: sentences carry multiple loads (setting, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and metaphors (“inverted blossoms swam across parchment like drowned stars”) are vivid and internally consistent. Rhythm varies well, with long, incantatory lines offset by shorter emphatic beats, and information flow is clear despite the density. Figurative language is frequent, but it feels patterned and controlled rather than indulgently purple, and there are no significant loops or synonym churn. A rare phrase or two (“a quiet, gnawing question”) leans slightly generic within such an otherwise idiosyncratic field, which is the main thing holding this just shy of absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is dense, musical, and highly image-driven, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Metaphors (“seconds pooled like mercury,” “gravity into a question mark”) are largely fresh and coherent with the story’s logic. There is some risk of saturation—so many striking metaphors in succession that a few land with slightly less force—but clarity and momentum are preserved, especially around the pivotal inversion beat. Minimal redundancy or scaffolding appears; the prose is largely publication-ready at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and purposeful, images are precise (“dust motes that danced like pollen”), and most metaphors work double duty for atmosphere and theme. There’s high information density with little scaffolding or redundancy, and syntax tends to support forward momentum even in lyrical passages. Some phrases and metaphors cluster toward the purple, and there’s mild intensifier stacking (“quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative”) that could be tightened at elite-publication standards. Still, there are no meaningful loops or artifacts, and closure imagery lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but controlled: metaphors (burning absences, time as cellular, shipwreck ribs) are coherent and generally non-redundant, with most lines doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Sentence rhythms shift purposefully, especially around the moment of the crack, which sharpens the climax. There is some risk of overload—nearly every sentence carries figurative weight—but clarity remains high and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Line-level craft is strong enough for elite venues, with only minor tightening needed if placed in a very prose-sparing magazine.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and mostly economical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character/world-building. Imagery is frequent but not so stacked as to blur sense, and metaphors are largely coherent and apt. There’s mild risk of purple excess and a few places where ideas are reiterated in slightly different phrasings (e.g., variations on fate speaking in patterns, her art as revelation) that could be tightened. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum never significantly suffer, and the closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong imagery (“quiet glow of molten silica,” “fossilized prayer”) and an ear for cadence that supports the contemplative mood. Most sentences do double duty—advancing setting, character, and theme simultaneously—and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. There is some risk of over-saturation in figurative language and a few repeated constructions that verge on purple, but clarity and momentum are never compromised. Tightening a handful of overtly explanatory phrases would elevate an already strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, high-density, and purposeful: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Imagery is vivid and coherent, and the final sequence (threading the reel, the film catching fire, the library painted in gold) lands with clarity rather than muddle. There is some figurative overgrowth—metaphor packed into line after line—that risks purple, especially in reflective sentences, but it doesn’t obscure cause/effect or closure. A modest pruning of the densest metaphors would elevate flow without altering substance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (image, mood, character) and the metaphors are mostly clean and non-muddled. There is some repetition of motifs (silence, hush, mapping) but it functions as pattern rather than looped redundancy, and paraphrase is minimal. The primary limitation is slight overwriting risk—figures like “like honeyed resin trapping ancient breath” and “marbled hush: striated” stack across the piece, which might fatigue some readers at elite-venue standards. Nonetheless, clarity is never lost and the closure image lands intact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, most images do double duty (atmosphere + theme), and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful, avoiding mixed metaphors or confusion; the prose reads smoothly aloud. A few phrases (“slow accretion of meaning,” “internal thresholds”) edge toward abstraction or familiar critical vocabulary, mildly thinning the sensory immediacy. Overall, momentum is maintained and the final paragraphs land cleanly without being smothered by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: dense, image-rich sentences that usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and action) without becoming opaque. There is some risk of purple or over-saturated imagery, but metaphors remain coherent and the syntax stays readable. Repetition and parallelism feel purposeful rather than looped scaffold, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric register. Minor grammatical slips (“had spent months eavesdrop”) and occasional over-stacking of descriptors keep it just short of top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense images that often do double duty, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphor is generally precise and thematically aligned (metrics vs memory; marbles as anti-data), and the firefly spiral is an excellent culminating image. There is a mild tendency toward saturation—nearly every sentence carries figurative weight—which occasionally nudges into ornament rather than pressure. Despite that, clarity and momentum remain intact and the closure beat lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and largely economical despite its lyric density; most metaphors (“peeling like layers of an onion… revealing lateral folds”) are both intelligible and on-theme. Information density is high and sentences often do double duty, advancing both atmosphere and concept. There is some repetition of favored constructions and adjectives (“mechanically warm,” “twilight,” variations on hush and wings) that occasionally skirts purple-prose territory but doesn’t obstruct clarity or momentum. Line-level control holds through the climax and ending with no major scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is dense but mostly efficient, with many sentences doing double duty (advancing both atmosphere and character) and very few true redundancies. Imagery is often striking (“each stain a note, each blotch a rest”), and the rhythm carries momentum through what could have felt static. There is some risk of over-saturation in repeated silence/absence metaphors, but clarity and closure remain intact and no major scaffolding artifacts appear. Overall, this is polished, publication-ready prose that might benefit from a light trim rather than structural revision.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with layered metaphors that stay coherent (silence as glacier, aurora as mourning light) and avoid mixed imagery. Sentence rhythm varies and supports mood, and most lines do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. A few phrases flirt with purple (“chorus of alpine rage,” “auroral sorrow”) but the piece has taught its lyric mode early, so they land as deliberate, not overwrought. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final image is crisp rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, dense but mostly efficient imagery, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors (e.g., “looms clattering like chattering teeth,” “dust falling…like silent applause”) are vivid and coherent, enhancing mood rather than obscuring sense. Prose keeps good momentum despite reflective content, with nearly every line advancing character or atmosphere. The closing thematic statements are slightly more abstract than the rest, but they remain clear and don’t significantly drag the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is lush and information-dense; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors are generally vivid and internally coherent, and syntax is clean and readable despite its complexity. That said, the figurative density is very high almost throughout, which can slightly flatten momentum and make some images feel interchangeable rather than sharply necessary. A bit more spareness at key beats would likely give the best images even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, rich with sensory detail and metaphor (“silver ring,” “velvet pause,” “quilt of moss,” etc.), and there are no clarity issues or obvious scaffolding/loops. Many sentences work double-duty, advancing both atmosphere and theme, and the final paragraph lands cleanly. However, figurative density is very high throughout; nearly every line is adorned, which can blur emphasis and feel slightly over-lush for top-tier markets. A bit more sparseness or modulation, especially in peak beats, would give the strongest images more room to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose shows high-level craft: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little scaffolding, and the read-aloud rhythm is pleasingly modulated. Metaphors are frequent but largely coherent and motif-consistent (teeth, threads, wounds, weaving), avoiding true purple muddle. There are no evident loops, clunky transitions, or syntax confusions; each paragraph advances texture or stakes. It stops short of the very top band because the density of figurative language occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than strictly necessary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and generally efficient, with many lines doing double duty for character, theme, and setting (“fog thicker than regret,” “cartographer of emotional coastlines”). Information flows clearly despite lyricism; there are no serious scaffold loops or structural artifacts. At times, metaphor and abstraction stack (“transposing life into a new key…existentially”) to the edge of purple, risking slight distance from concrete experience. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and control hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally excellent—densely imagistic, with many sentences pulling double duty for atmosphere and theme (“He decorates with silence, not as absence, but as architecture”). However, figurative density is very high throughout, with near-constant metaphors that occasionally feel stacked rather than escalatory, risking reader fatigue at elite-publication standards. Clarity remains intact at closure, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy, but judicious pruning of a few ornamental clauses would sharpen momentum. Line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs, moving image, world, and emotion at once, and the rhythm modulates effectively from hushed to crescendo and back. Figurative language is frequent but, for the most part, precise and coherent with the musical/mnemonic conceit; there are very few strained or mixed metaphors. There is mild purple density in spots (“upturned hush,” “trapped breath”), but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or momentum. The final movement, from vibrating spire to reverent silence and a warm shell, reads clearly and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) and the imagery is generally fresh (“between the drop and the ripple,” “runes peeling open like petals”). There is some density of metaphor and abstract language that edges toward purple, but it remains mostly coherent and does not obscure causality or closure. Repetition is used purposefully (“She wasn’t flying—she was unclaimed”; “not with defiance, but with weary recognition”) rather than as scaffolding. Further tightening could prune a few near-duplicate conceptual gestures around fear and recursion to increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense but not muddled, metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned with inversion and sound, and there’s little to no scaffold or synonym-churn. Figurative language is frequent but well-controlled, usually doing multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, theme). Pacing holds; no paragraph feels redundant, and the climax is shown rather than summarized. Minor copy issues (e.g., “enthrall” usage) are the only noticeable blemishes.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense with information, and generally free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences do at least two jobs (mood, character, or world-building). Rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical, and imagery like “rewriting of reality’s edges” is strong without being incoherent. There is a mild tendency toward repeated sentence openings (“He…” “He…”) and occasional near-ornamental abstraction, but they don’t significantly drag momentum or blur sense. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the story’s conceptual palette.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty (advancing scene and theme together). Images are often striking and coherent, especially the UV glyphs and the lanterns catching ghostly blue. That said, figurative language is frequent enough that it occasionally borders on purple, and there are minor redundancies (e.g., phrase-level repetition of “as the transformation completes”) that could be trimmed for even sharper momentum. Despite this slight overwriting, clarity and closure remain intact and the reading experience is fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid figurative language that often does double duty for atmosphere and theme. Some metaphors are excellent and grounded (“its story seep into her palms like tea into bone”), while others risk purple-prose overload across the piece. The line-level rhythm remains readable and mostly propulsive despite heavy ornamentation, and cause/effect is never obscured. A modest trim of thematic restatements and a few metaphors would lift it into a more rarefied register.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often gorgeous and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the violin “hums…with the ghost of song—unfinished, aching, alive”). Syntax varies, transitions are smooth, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. However, figurative language is packed into a high proportion of sentences, risking a sense of over-richness that could slightly dull impact for a very demanding market. Trimming a few metaphors would heighten propulsion, but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously) without obvious scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and apt (“wind through cathedral glass,” “stitched from static and sacrifice”), and syntax supports the emotional contour of each beat. There are moments that flirt with purple or conceptual stacking, but they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall line-level craft is strong enough for high-end venues with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, largely concise, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty in advancing atmosphere and character. Recurring images (tides, stars, harbor sounds) create a cohesive texture, and syntax is generally varied and readable aloud. There are spots of mild purple or redundancy (“whimsically attentive,” “harbor’s heartbeat”) that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness. Nonetheless, no major scaffolding or figurative muddle obstructs momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and the rhythm alternates well between long, lush lines and shorter emphatic beats. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and sensorially grounded (“moss that glowed like drowned constellations,” “glyphs swirling like startled fish”). There is mild purple-prose drift and some paraphrastic reiteration of the same emotional idea (loneliness/belonging) that a top-tier editor would likely trim. Nonetheless, clarity remains strong and momentum is not seriously compromised, keeping this comfortably publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and image-rich—“raw vibrations curled like embryos in amniotic silence” typifies its ambition—yet generally clear and propulsive, with each sentence adding either world logic or emotional/coloristic weight. Figurative language is frequent but thematically unified (sound, time, bodies), avoiding major mixed-metaphor confusion. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition; action order is easy to follow even in the more abstract moments like sculpting time around the chime. A slight tendency toward saturation in imagery keeps it from feeling absolutely taut, but craft is well above typical submission level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined: images do multiple jobs, and most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm and paragraphing are well modulated, with a satisfying cadence into the final lines. There is some risk of over-density in figurative language, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum and does not obscure the closure beat. No obvious scaffold, loops, or syntactic templates undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character and atmosphere (“an archaeology of abandonment,” “it fit in her palm like a broken promise”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent, building a motif set rather than a grab-bag of metaphors; momentum rarely stalls despite the lyricism. There are no notable loops, scaffolding phrases, or figurative muddles that blur cause and effect, and the final image resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and imagery that usually pulls double duty (atmosphere plus psychology). Metaphors tend to be coherent and character-anchored, such as moss taking on “absorbed sorrow” or veins glowing like “liquid circuitry.” There is some risk of overload—figurative language appears frequently and occasionally leans purple—but momentum largely holds and closure remains crisp. Minimal redundancy or scaffolding appears, and transitions between beats are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like the ocean as “a librarian of loss” and the brooch “glowing like a trapped sunset” are vivid without becoming muddled or overwrought. Sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, mood) with high information density and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and thematically cohesive (water, light, archives), and the prose accelerates or softens appropriately around key beats. I see no grammatical issues or rhythmic artifacts that obscure meaning or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines carry more than one function (world, mood, and character together). Figurative language is generally apt and sensory, and the rhythm supports the accumulating pressure. There is slight tendency toward purple/over-ornate phrasing and thematic restatement near the end, but not enough to stall momentum or obscure sense. The prose remains clear, musical, and well proofread.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: images are precise (“salt clinging… like forgotten prayers”), sentences carry multiple jobs, and there’s minimal redundancy. The figurative density is high but largely coherent; motifs of tide, silt, valves, and charts recur with discipline rather than decorative churn. Momentum holds despite the lyric mode, in part because nearly every sentence advances either method, world-building, or thematic patterning. It flirts with purple in a few abstractions (“resonant with implication”), but not enough to materially dull clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many images doing double duty for setting and theme, and grammar/sequence remain clean. However, figurative density is consistently very high—nearly every paragraph contains multiple metaphors or abstractions (“air hummed with withheld confessions,” “sky stitched with cold stars”), nudging the prose toward decorative excess in places. Despite that, causality and closure stay clear; the purple-leaning moments don’t obscure what’s happening. A slight pruning of metaphor and abstract phrasing would likely lift this into an elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty, advancing both scene and thematic texture, and the “not with X, but with Y” patterning feels deliberate rather than formulaic. Imagery is vivid and coherent (whales as cello, tile as rhythmic breathing), with few if any mixed metaphors or clotted constructions. There is some minor redundancy and abstract phrasing that could be trimmed for even tighter momentum, especially around explaining Elira’s motivation. Nonetheless, the prose reads polished and publication-ready with only light line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and purposeful, with strong verbs and images doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., “magnetic tendrils lashing the void like whips of ionized regret” sets tone, world, and mood). There is a high rate of figurative language, but it mostly avoids mixed metaphors and maintains clarity, and scaffolding or synonym loops are minimal. Rhythm varies well between long, baroque sentences and shorter, grounding beats like “He didn’t flinch. / Method mattered.” A touch of purple in places slightly softens impact but doesn’t dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and vivid, with good information density—many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “calculated the viscosity of human distraction”). Sentence rhythm varies and reads smoothly aloud. There is some repetition and near-loops in conceptual phrasing (“calcified,” “fortress of unfairness,” “mathematics of fair trade,” and variants of “not with X, but with Y”), which risks slight overwriting and dilutes impact. Still, clarity is never lost, metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded, and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet largely precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffold. Metaphors tend to be coherent and thematically aligned (rings, hums, archives, quilts), and the rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. At an elite-lit standard, the constant high-density figurative mode edges toward overrich in places, with few “clean” lines to provide contrast, which slightly blunts impact. Still, clarity is preserved and the final beats land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences tend to carry multiple jobs (image, theme, character) with few true redundancies, and metaphor is largely coherent (“sediment,” “residue,” “quilt of whispers”). There is some density of figurative language, but it’s pattern-consistent rather than purple for its own sake. The prose maintains clarity under its lyric load, and the final image is sharp and legible. Minor repetition of motif clusters (rust/salt/steel) and occasional abstract nouns slightly dull the edge but don’t impair momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is strong: most sentences do double duty (image + emotion or image + theme), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent within the observatory/music/ocean lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. Momentum holds through the ritual description into the climax, with no major clarity issues around who is doing what, when. The main drag on a higher score is that the prose sometimes verges on uniformly lush, reducing contrast and risking a slight sense of over-ornamentation rather than sharp modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is precise, vivid, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. The figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and sensical, sustaining a lush carnival texture rather than devolving into mixed metaphors or redundancy. Momentum is maintained through varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraphing; there’s very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At a top-tier level, some high-intensity passages could benefit from strategic simplification to let a few images hit harder without competing metaphorical noise.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do double duty advancing atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned rather than overwrought. There are minimal paraphrase loops, and each paragraph shifts or deepens the emotional charge rather than restating. The closure beat (“You outlasted them all.”) lands cleanly without syntactic clutter, and nothing in the final third muddies the image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, and there are no obvious loops, scaffolds, or mechanical artifacts. The figurative language is often striking and multi-functional, layering atmosphere and theme. However, metaphors are frequent enough that the prose edges toward lushness that slightly softens momentum and contrast; nearly every sentence in some stretches carries an image. Tightening a few figurative clusters, especially in less pivotal moments, would sharpen the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is highly crafted: strong verbs, layered images, and sentences that usually carry multiple functions (voice, worldbuilding, theme) without padding. There’s a clear rhythmic sensibility and momentum rarely stalls despite reflective passages. However, figurative density is near-constant—metaphors in almost every line in places (“stars that hadn’t moved in centuries,” “bookmark in the fabric of reality”)—which occasionally edges toward purple and risks numbing impact. Trimming a few metaphors or intensifiers would sharpen the best images and lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level writing is polished and musical, with high information density: most sentences carry setting, mood, and thematic charge at once. Repetition (“Not resurrected. Not restored...”) is used as a purposeful rhythmic device rather than scaffolding, and there are few if any redundant paraphrase loops. Figurative language is generally precise and grounded in the story’s sonic/mnemonic lexicon. A few spots flirt with purple or conceptual stacking, but they don’t materially blur sense or slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a scent bloomed…salt and sorrow and starlight, the distilled essence of a thousand drowned prayers”). However, figurative language is nearly constant, sometimes stacking metaphors in ways that risk purple prose and slightly dull momentum in high-pressure beats. There is also at least one noticeable grammatical slip (“designed to touches memories”), which undercuts polish for an elite venue. Overall rhythm and clarity hold, but a light pruning of ornament would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and dense with meaning; most sentences multitask on mood, worldbuilding, and theme without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and on-theme, and there are no major loops or syntactic stumbles to slow momentum. A few phrases (“copperlight repose,” “thread a labyrinth with his own story,” “chased hush into a prison”) flirt with purple abstraction, but they don’t obscure causality or the climax. Overall, the piece reads like finished literary work rather than draft-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and many metaphors are apt and memorable (“tears steaming on her gloves,” “a kiss that tasted of arsenic and absolution”). Rhythm is varied, with good use of short sentences to punctuate the awakening sequence. There is some tendency toward overload—figurative language in a high proportion of sentences and a few near-redundant intensifiers—which verges on purple at moments but does not materially obscure sense or closure. A rigorous line edit trimming a handful of stacked modifiers and reiterations would align it with top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, multi-tasking images, and rhythmic variation that keeps the lyricism from bogging down. Metaphors are mostly coherent and fresh (e.g., “rebellion dressed in lace,” “storm’s clouds…hauling up drowned constellations”), and momentum is preserved despite reflection. A few lines edge toward purple or platitudinal abstraction in the final paragraph, but they do not materially blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are generally tight yet rich, with well-controlled imagery and a good sense of cadence across the paragraph blocks. Metaphors usually cohere to the root/bone/time palette, and many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme. That said, figurative density stays high throughout, and the closing section drifts into abstraction and slogan-like phrasing (“the diaspora returnee became the orchard’s quiet compass”), edging toward purple and slightly sapping momentum. Trimming a few thesis-y or redundant phrases would sharpen the already potent images.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with vivid metaphors (“brass mail chutes polished to nostalgia,” “ticker tapes long silent”) and high information density; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Rhythm is well controlled and paragraphing supports the accumulative, meditative mode. There is some repetition of concepts (“meaning in the margins,” analog vs digital) and frequent figurative language that risks slight purple-tinge, but it rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum at this length. A touch more restraint—trusting images over reiterating the thesis—would push this closer to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density and many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding plus character plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and image-specific (“needle flashing like a comet’s tail,” “echo-chamber of almost-was”), and there are few if any outright mixed metaphors or loops. That said, nearly every line is metaphorically loaded, risking saturation and occasional purple overtones that a top-tier editor would likely trim for contrast and impact. Clarity remains strong throughout, and the final paragraph lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musically varied, images are mostly fresh (“wax that cracked like frozen regret,” “seed of stone waiting to sprout watchful eyes”), and each paragraph advances either emotional pressure or worldbuilding. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and multi-functional, and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. The rhythm tightens appropriately toward the end, with shorter lines carrying the closure image. A handful of moments verge on purple (“threads of silver resolve,” “fierce tenderness”) yet stay within control; trimming one or two such phrases would push the prose into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, information density is high, and most metaphors pull their weight thematically as well as atmospherically. There is little scaffolding or repetition; each paragraph genuinely advances mood, image, or insight. However, figurative density is very high, and a few constructions (“lotus-hearted ache,” “peace is never signed, only sutured”) feel a shade ornamental or aphoristic, slightly blurring immediacy. Tightening or pruning a handful of showy lines would likely be required at an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished and deliberate: most sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Metaphors—fog as gauze, atmosphere as emulsion, blossoms as snow—are coherent and thematically aligned rather than mixed. The prose verges on purple density in spots, but it remains intelligible and rhythmically varied, and key beats (the projection, the laughter, the pocketing of the fragment) land clearly. Some minor trimming of adjectival weight could sharpen momentum further, but there are no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“Sound became shape. Shape became scent—…”). Line-level clarity is high despite the conceptual ambition, and there are no obvious loops or scaffolding artifacts. Some stretches verge on purple—dense with metaphor and triadic structures—that slightly risk saturation at this length, especially for ultra-competitive markets. Still, momentum largely holds, and the closure image is sharp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that is generally purposeful and coherent with the insect/plant/grammar motifs. Lines often do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, character) without feeling padded. The prose edges lush but rarely spills into true purple; momentum holds from first to last image. A few metaphoric clusters (“converging chaos of winged things and whispering vines”) repeat texture rather than adding pressure, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense and purposeful: most sentences carry worldbuilding, emotional color, and theme simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and of a piece, and there is little true scaffolding or repetition. However, the figurative saturation is very high across the whole piece, with almost every line reaching for imagery; for some readers, this risks sensory fatigue and occasionally blurs sharpness of individual beats. Tightening just a few metaphor clusters would likely push this into clear elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is tight for this lyric mode: most sentences do double duty, advancing world, mood, and character together, and there’s little paraphrase or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and fresh, and it doesn’t obscure the core action of hanging the chime, naming, and following the light. There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every line is metaphorically charged—which can dull impact for a very exacting market, but clarity and momentum survive. Syntax is varied, mechanics are clean, and the closure image lands crisply.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is consistently high: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuild, theme, emotion) with minimal redundancy, and rhythm modulates well between contemplative and ritual intensity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent (“dust motes into spirals,” “walls themselves seemed to exhale”), avoiding metaphor muddle. There are no real scaffold loops or clunky transitions; each paragraph adds new information or pressure. The slightly lush density skirts purple but remains under control, and does not blur clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is impressive: sentences are varied, precise, and information-dense, often doing triple duty for atmosphere, character, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and motivated; images like “caramel smear…smelling faintly of bergamot and regret” and “tuning fork struck against grief” feel fresh rather than generic. At times, metaphor density skirts purple, but it rarely muddies sense or drags momentum, so the piece remains clear and propulsive for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly multi-tasking: images advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously (“dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets” encapsulates memory, language, and space at once). Figurative language is frequent yet consistent in its lexicon (books, stars, music, maps), avoiding mixed metaphors or confusing vehicles. There’s minimal scaffold or redundancy; nearly every sentence earns its place and momentum never stalls despite the lyric mode. A very slight risk of purple excess in a few lines is the only thing keeping this from the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely precise: metaphors are coherent, multi-functioning (bench as anchor, chronologer, conduit), and rarely feel strained. There is minimal redundancy; almost every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or character. The high figurative load skirts purple in places but does not blur sense or undercut the closure image. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the final lines land cleanly without scaffold or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are fresh, syntax varied, and most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and purposeful (e.g., “shadowseam wonder—beauty stitched into fracture”), and I didn’t find paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. A few constructions verge on purple or concept-heavy, yet they don’t significantly blur sense or stall momentum. The closing paragraph’s abstractions are the weakest stylistically, but they don’t damage the closure image enough to warrant a major deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have musical variety, and most metaphors are apt and sensory (“sketch the wind by watching how it bends the grass”). The prose is dense but usually multi-functional, advancing setting, mood, and theme at once. There are moments of near-purple or conceptual abstraction that don’t add much new information (“even in vanishing, a kind of music”), and some end-of-story lines reiterate already-earned insights. Still, momentum and clarity hold, and no major artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, syntactically clean, and consistently doing double duty (worldbuilding + theme, character + atmosphere). Figurative language is frequent but usually apt and controlled; the piece skirts purple prose without tipping over, thanks to clear images and grounded objects (coins, shells, pebbles). There is some conceptual redundancy near the end where Elias’s philosophy is re-explained, slightly blunting momentum. Still, clarity and rhythm are preserved throughout with no major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and multitask (worldbuilding, emotion, and image at once). Some metaphoric clustering—especially repeated references to tides, verses, and “sighs”—comes close to purple prose and risks slight saturation, and a few phrases verge on redundancy (“gravitational sighs and stellar sighs”). Nonetheless, clarity is maintained throughout; cause/effect and spatial relations remain legible even in the densest lyric passages. Tightening a handful of overlapping metaphors and trimming echoing constructions would elevate this to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and many images doing double duty for setting and theme (“fog clinging low over the water like breath held too long”). Sentence rhythm is varied and generally propulsive for a contemplative piece. There is a heavy concentration of metaphor and abstraction that edges toward purple in places, but coherence is maintained and the key images remain clear. Very little feels redundant or scaffold-like; almost every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and many lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., “The ridge path became an altar—not of stone, but of surrendered sorrow”). Imagery is often striking and coherent, and grammar/usage are clean. That said, figurative density is very high—metaphor stacks appear in many consecutive sentences—and several abstracted thematic lines feel like mild purple prose or repetition around “pain” and “translation.” This slight overwriting trims the score in an otherwise strong stylistic performance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and motion) with few redundancies, and the rhythm supports the meditative mode. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled and internally consistent; images like timelines as “silk scarves in a slow wind” align with the story’s physics. There is some tendency toward abstraction stacking (“probability of grace under temporal duress”) that slightly dulls immediacy. Still, clarity at key beats—the obsidian disc, needle swing, and multiverse sigh—is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and multilayered, often doing character, setting, and theme work simultaneously (“Each fragment a stone dropped into the well of legacy’s burden…”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, with no major mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. A couple of lines verge on purple or thematic over-assertion, but they don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Information density is high without feeling cramped, and paragraphs cut cleanly around shifts in focus and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and densely imagistic, with most lines doing double duty for mood and concept. Extended metaphors (light, heartbeat, lullaby, mirrors) remain consistent without collapsing into mixed or incoherent imagery. The prose flirts with ornateness—nearly every sentence is figurative—which risks saturation but rarely impairs clarity or momentum in this contemplative mode. There is little scaffold or repetition; the rhythm carries smoothly into a well-landed final line.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing action while layering atmosphere—and a largely effective rhythmic variety. Metaphor and elevated diction are rich and mostly controlled, with recurring “not X, but Y” structures that create a recognizable cadence. That said, the density of figurative language and thematic statement occasionally verges on purple, risking slight momentum drag in what is already a static physical situation. Tightening a few abstract or redundant lines would sharpen impact without losing the lyric quality.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: high information density, clean syntax, and metaphor that generally coheres to the sensory and emotional situation (“cracks that remembered how to hold beauty”). Repetition is purposeful and rhythmic rather than scaffolded, and there’s no significant synonym churn or paraphrase loops. The prose does edge into purple in a few spots (e.g., “windshield smudged with salt and starlight”) but not enough to blur sense or slow momentum. Overall, the language feels controlled and intentional, with only minor risk of over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is rich, dense, and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“Snowflakes settled on her shoulders like benedictions, melting not from warmth, but from the heat of her intent”). There is, however, a near-constant use of figurative language and ornate phrasing that edges into purple in aggregate, slightly blurring impact and risking reader fatigue. Some concepts are restated (lullaby, echoes, refusal) where a leaner pass could heighten propulsion. Still, clarity remains intact and the closing image is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is vivid and information-dense, with metaphors that are largely coherent and grounded in the story’s imagery (ink, fire, cold machinery, performance). Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing history, atmosphere, and psychology at once—without much redundancy or scaffolding. A few phrases verge on purple (“meteor hush,” “velvet fog”), but they’re thematically in-key and not piled to the point of muddling clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing support a sense of accumulating quiet pressure rather than drag.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, with many images doing double-duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or personification (“history forgets to breathe,” “stories stitched with silences”), which edges toward purple and occasionally feels redundant. There are a few conceptual overlaps (indifference/forgetting/erasure) that could be tightened without loss. These are finesse issues; closure remains clear and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is highly crafted: images are fresh (“ceiling glows like a bruise healing into dawn,” “snowmelt ardor”), syntax varies, and most sentences carry multiple layers of work (world, emotion, and theme at once). Despite abundant figurative language, there’s little true purple or muddled metaphor; the rope, bell, and helix keep imagery disciplined. Momentum is meditative but not stagnant; each paragraph adds a concrete step or reweights an image rather than looping. The only slight drag is the occasional over-articulation of concepts already dramatized, which could be tightened without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, multi-functional, and rhythmically varied, and the diction is purposeful and evocative. Figurative language is abundant but coherent, with only occasional drift toward purple (“chlorophyll patience,” “blooming in her chest like a slow detonation”) rather than outright muddle. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines add genuine new texture or meaning. A hard-nosed edit would likely pare a few metaphors and intensifiers to sharpen impact, but the prose is already near-publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character simultaneously), and the rhythms generally support the slow, ritualistic mood. Some repetition and metaphor stacking (“dusky harmony,” “syrup under moonlight,” multiple “encrypted” / “covenant” invocations) flirt with purple prose but don’t significantly obscure sense. There are no serious clarity issues or loops; each paragraph adds new nuance or pressure. Still, the persistent high-flown register and figurative saturation would likely prompt line edits in a top-tier venue, holding it under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong—dense with purpose-driven images and minimal outright scaffolding; many lines do double duty in theme and atmosphere. Repetition is often effective as pattern rather than loop (“Not catharsis. / Not healing. / Release.”). There is some conceptual redundancy and near-therapy jargon (“stored fury,” “cellular memory,” “resentment… unspools”) that flirts with abstraction and could be pared for even greater sharpness. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, sensory, and often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) at once. However, figurative density is high, with stacked metaphors and lush modifiers that risk purple prose and occasionally slow momentum. Some parallel constructions and list-like reiterations feel more ornamental than pressured. Even so, causality and closure remain clear, and there are no major scaffolding or redundancy artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are often striking, and most metaphors (“deciduous vows,” “captured sky”) are coherent and multi-functional. Prose density is high but purposeful; description generally advances character, theme, or action rather than stalling momentum. There is minor risk of purple prose and thematic overstatement near the end, but no serious loops or muddled figurative runs that obscure clarity. The final image is clean and well-framed, giving a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and imagistic without collapsing into total purple; most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) efficiently. Metaphors are generally coherent and thematically aligned (tuning fork bones, embryo stars, origami traps), and repetition is purposeful rather than looped. Line-level momentum holds; there are few, if any, true scaffolding sentences or synonym churn. The density of figurative language is high enough that one or two images feel slightly ornamental, which lightly blunts sharpness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and economical for its density; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Imagery around language, time, and botany is generally precise and non-generic, and syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged. A few constructions and aphoristic statements (“every gap is a rest waiting to be filled with meaning”) flirt with over-written or didactic territory, slightly blunting impact. Still, clarity and momentum remain strong, and no figurative muddle undermines the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is strong, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density; most sentences perform multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and characterization) simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, e.g., “vines thick with petals shaped like letters” richly embodies the premise. A few lines border on purple or conceptual redundancy (“solace unkindled—a peace not yet lit”), but they do not materially obscure action or stakes. There are no obvious scaffolding phrases, loops, or mechanical cadences that drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, well-paced, and usually do more than one job (world-building, character, and theme at once). There’s some repetition of similar syntactic structures and abstract phrasing (“not by force, but by reconfiguration”) that edges toward mild thematic echo, but it doesn’t meaningfully drag momentum. Imagery is concrete when it needs to be and rarely purple; there are no serious metaphor clashes or loops. Tighter pruning of a few near-duplicate conceptual statements could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but generally precise; most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, atmosphere, character) without collapsing into muddle. Metaphoric language is frequent yet largely coherent and pattern-consistent, and there’s little true redundancy or scaffolding. Momentum holds despite the lyricism, and the closure image is clear. A few lines flirt with purple or conceptual abstraction, but they don’t materially obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or action plus theme), and figurative language is rich yet usually precise (“shard of hush,” “core cracked like a frozen tear”). Rhythm varies organically, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode; there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Some metaphors stack a touch heavily (“thistle-blown hope, that stubborn weed-rooted optimism”) and a few late lines tilt toward purple or slogan-like, but they don’t obscure clarity or blunt the closure image. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for image and concept, and the rhythm flows smoothly, especially in the closing paragraphs where the hush internalizes. Figurative density is high, but the metaphors are largely coherent and controlled (“shadows…like slow hands of a clock counting griefs” is a fine example). There is minor redundancy and a touch of purple—certain phrases and constructions recur without always adding new pressure—which slightly blunts momentum in a few spots. Overall, though, clarity remains high and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly precise: images like “stone battlements have split open like overripe fruit” and “dust…like a constellation waiting to be named” are vivid and layered without collapsing into muddle. Sentences tend to do multiple jobs at once (world-building, emotion, and motion), keeping momentum despite the lyricism. Figurative language is frequent, yet the metaphoric field (combustion, bloom, sound, stars) remains coherent, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding lines. The only constraint on a higher score is that the high figural density occasionally risks feeling ornamental rather than pressure-driven, even if it never fully bogs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; images like “moonlight fractured…like memory shards” and “the wind…hummed a minor chord that vibrated in her molars” are vivid and precise. Line-level rhythm is strong, with varied openings and paragraphing that tracks shifts in focus. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—figurative language appears very frequently—but it rarely muddies clarity or feels like mere ornament. A top-tier venue might suggest slight trimming of abstractions in the final third, but the overall craft is high.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is densely imagistic yet generally precise, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and a strong read-aloud rhythm. Recurrent motifs (“gilded hush,” “intangibly tangible,” flavored silences) feel patterned rather than redundant, and major metaphors are coherent with the story’s sensory logic. There are no obvious scaffold sentences or paraphrase loops; momentum carries through to the charged final image. The only minor limitation is that sustained metaphorical richness borders on over-lush in places, which might be trimmed slightly for maximal sharpness in an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory, and generally efficient, with metaphors (frozen auroras, clockwork sigh) that enrich rather than obscure. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; most lines perform multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and emotional tracking at once). The prose occasionally edges toward overstatement in thematic lines and dense modifiers but remains clear and sonically pleasing. Rhythm tracks the scene’s calm pressure well, with no artifacts that muddy the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and multi-function sentences that advance plot, world, and mood simultaneously. Metaphors are often striking (“stairway of ascension—not stone, not steel, but solidified memory”), and prose remains clear despite conceptual ambition. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, with stacked modifiers and elaborate images in many consecutive sentences, especially early on, creating a mild sense of purple excess that could be sharpened by a few plainer beats. There are no significant clarity errors or loops, but some restraint would better match elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and the prose generally reads clearly despite density. Yet figurative language is packed into nearly every line—“tasting of burnt sugar and old tears,” “silence shaped like sanctuary,” “each severed tie a stitch pulled from a fraying tapestry”—creating a persistent purple hue. A few paraphrase-like reiterations (burning bridges, suffocation/breath framed multiple ways) slow momentum. The closure image remains sharp, but trimming and varying density would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, compressed, and usually do multiple jobs at once, balancing worldbuilding with emotional charge. Figurative language is vivid yet mostly controlled; images like “shadowseam wonder” and “lattice of pure, resonant clarity” feel fresh rather than generic. There’s minor redundancy in explicit explanatory lines (“It wasn’t about wealth. It was alchemy of the soul.”) where the prose tells what the images already show, and a few abstractions could be trimmed for even more impact. Overall, though, clarity, rhythm, and information density are high without slipping into muddle or purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (setting, mood, characterization) with relatively little scaffolding, and rhythm varies effectively. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally borders on purple, yet metaphors are mostly coherent and thematically aligned with sound and light; they rarely feel arbitrary. The explanatory block about standing waves and training in the caves is the densest and most expository stretch, flirting with over-explanation but not enough to break momentum. There are no obvious loops, mixed metaphors, or mechanical artifacts dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) with strong imagery and momentum, and the closure image is clear and potent. There is a high density of figurative language, but most metaphors cohere and extend established motifs rather than feeling random. A few phrases verge on purple or concept-heavy (“factually mystical,” “new grammar, a new syntax of becoming”), adding a touch of overstatement without derailing clarity. No major loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied rhythm, clear syntax, and high information density where most lines do at least two jobs. Phrases like “Dust, she’d learned, was never random” and “each entry was a counterweight to despair” are compact and evocative. There is some drift toward purple and thematic repetition in the final third (“sanctuary of examined unknowns,” “unwritten anthem for the unseen”) that feels a bit on-the-nose. Still, momentum and clarity never suffer, and obvious scaffolding or loops are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, information-dense, and generally free of scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery (“sun bled into shadow,” “water cool as forgotten truth”) is vivid and mostly coherent, with figurative language doing real work instead of mere ornament. The prose occasionally skirts purple with stacked modifiers and repeated intensifiers, but not to the point of obscuring sense or slowing momentum. No major syntactic or clarity issues interfere with the climax or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and sonically pleasing, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“ink in milk,” “threading the gaps between breath and echo”). Clarity of action and causality remains intact despite the density of figurative language, and the closure image is sharp. That said, metaphor and lush description are nearly continuous, with occasional redundancy or near-synonymous restatements that edge toward purple and slightly dampen momentum. A touch more austerity or variation in texture, especially at peak beats, would give the strongest images more room to land.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is dense yet mostly precise; metaphors are apt and extend core images (arbor as cathedral/loom, memory as seeds and dust-specks). There is some flirtation with purple (“air tasted of petrichor and starlight,” “moonstone cabochon dust speck, no larger than a mite’s eyelash”), but it seldom muddies meaning or stalls momentum. Sentences generally do double duty—worldbuilding and emotional shading at once—and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The lushness would need only minor trimming for certain elite venues, but the craft is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and meaning; there are few if any true scaffolding or redundant lines. Rhythm and paragraphing maintain momentum despite a reflective mode. At times the figurative density pushes toward purple, and a handful of near-aphoristic lines could be tightened or grounded more concretely. Still, clarity remains high, and the closing images (the watch sinking, the greenhouse return) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is rich and musical, with strong imagery and generally efficient sentences that multitask atmosphere, character, and theme. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and earned, and there’s little in the way of scaffold, repetition, or clunky exposition. At times, the density of figurative language and abstract nouns (“architecture of her soul,” “gravity of unresolved purpose”) edges toward purple, softening the impact of the simplest core images. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that mostly cohere with the established imagery of sound and geology. Phrases like “luminous ache” and “turning every fissure into a vein of gold” are evocative and support the tone. The prose does flirt with purple—there’s a high density of figurative language—but the pattern is consistent and legible rather than muddled, so momentum holds. Trimming one or two expository-theme lines and a couple of stacked metaphors would sharpen the impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs of image, emotion, and theme; rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum in a largely interior piece. Metaphor chains (topology, equations, light, trauma) are generally coherent and not contradictory, and there are few outright loops or scaffolding phrases. That said, figurative language appears in nearly every line, which edges toward purple and occasionally blurs immediacy, especially in peak beats where a plainer sentence might hit harder. The line-level craft is strong and nearly publish-ready, but would benefit from a touch of pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, carry multiple layers of information (worldbuilding, emotion, theme), and read smoothly aloud. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and apt (“edges sharp as regret,” “stories folded into origami birds”), maintaining clarity even in dense passages. There is a mild risk of saturation—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which could be pared back for even sharper impact, but it doesn’t materially obscure action or closure. No noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical artifacts interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty advancing atmosphere and character. Metaphors are generally clear and apt, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is some flirtation with purple prose (e.g., “the ghost of glitter,” “analysis was his liturgy; observation, his prayer”) but it remains controlled and coherent rather than muddling sense. A slight tightening of a few ornate constructions could sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense yet controlled, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and atmosphere (“books bled ink into the air, forming sentences that hovered like startled birds”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there is little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly coherent and legible, and the closure image is clear and strong. The high metaphor density edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t significantly obscure action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“marble veined with fossilized starlight,” “burnished sorrow”). Despite the lushness, syntax remains clear and momentum rarely stalls; there are no significant paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. A few lines edge toward purple or explanatory (“not to restore, but to reimagine an entire civilization from its broken pieces”) but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Overall information density and rhythmic variety are strong enough for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is lush, information-dense, and mostly efficient—many sentences do double or triple duty in image, worldbuilding, and emotion (“each note a pebble dropped into still water”). Rhythm is varied and read-aloud friendly, with few scaffolding or filler constructions. There is some risk of ornament saturation, as figurative language appears in a high proportion of lines and occasionally edges toward reiterating the same emotional note. Still, clarity remains high and the closure imagery is crisp rather than muddled, keeping the prose comfortably above typical “purple” territory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and largely purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. Some metaphors are striking (“like the first sigh after creation”), though at times the figurative layering approaches saturation and risks preciousness. There is little obvious scaffolding or repetition; momentum is maintained despite the lyrical pacing. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in peak beats keeps it just under the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “signal dissolving like salt in seawater” and “turbine-hum reverie” are fresh, and most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, characterization, theme) without bloat. Figurative density is high but generally controlled and coherent, with minimal mixed metaphors or redundant phrasing. A few lines veer toward conceptual abstraction or repetition (“perpetually learning,” reiterated thesis statements), but they don’t significantly drag momentum or obscure action. Rhythm on the page supports a meditative yet forward-moving cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are often doing double duty (atmosphere plus theme), and syntax varies enough to maintain momentum in a lyric register. However, there is some piling of metaphors and near-redundant abstractions (“umbral tenderness,” repeated invocations of hush, breath, and velvet shadows) that edge toward purple and could be pruned for even greater impact. Despite this, clarity remains high and the closure image is sharp rather than muddled. The piece passes the read-aloud test, but tighter economy would be needed for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with many lines doing triple duty for image, theme, and mood (“obsidian lagoon… like spilled ink under moonlight”). Rhythm mostly avoids mechanical patterns, and there’s little outright redundancy or scaffolding. At times figurative density approaches purple—stacked metaphors and long strings of modifiers—but coherence survives and the closure image remains sharp. A light line edit to prune a few intensifiers and slightly varied constructions in repeated clauses (“not as text, but as…”) would increase propulsion without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but mostly purposeful; images do multiple jobs, and there’s little outright scaffolding or repetition. The metaphor of the bottle as “working memory made manifest” is both conceptually fresh and clearly explained without clogging momentum, and the sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony. A few lines push toward over-explanation or slogan (“nostalgia was a narcotic, not a blueprint”), flirting with didacticism rather than letting the images carry them. Overall, clarity and propulsion hold, and figurative language remains coherent and grounded in the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density and minimal redundancy; nearly every sentence does atmospheric or conceptual work. Metaphors are mostly apt (“dissolved time like sugar in tea,” “velvet disquiet”), though the frequency of figurative language approaches purple in places. Rhythm varies well, and there are no obvious scaffold phrases or loops dragging momentum. Line-level craft is strong but not quite spare or surprising enough under peak pressure to push into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and world-building at once), and the rhythm modulates effectively from stillness to movement. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and legible; images like droplets rising and “flowers opened like fists relaxing” are precise and apt. There is a mild risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition (entropy, time, tenderness) that could be shaved for maximal impact, but it does not significantly obscure causality or dull the ending. Overall, the prose passes a high bar for clarity and musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and character while maintaining clarity, and there are no obvious scaffolds or repetition loops. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified (breath, sound, weather, ritual), giving the piece a strong textural identity. At times the density of imagery edges toward purple, which slightly softens momentum in mid-paragraph stretches. Overall, though, syntax, punctuation, and pacing are clean and purposeful, especially in the storm-approach and bell-toll sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and generally purposeful figurative language (“a silent bloom of light, spreading like ink in water”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and most lines carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, characterization). There is mild risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition around stillness, vulnerability, and reverence, but it doesn’t materially drag momentum or cloud meaning. No major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush, with high information density and many sentences doing double-duty for atmosphere and theme; rhythm generally carries momentum despite a contemplative mode. Some figurative density approaches purple—ghosts “draped in the residue of unspoken words,” “architecture of silence”—yet remains mostly coherent and purposeful. Redundancy is minimal, but there are small paraphrase echoes and stacked modifiers that could be trimmed for maximum sharpness. Line-level craft is strong enough for competitive venues, though just slightly over-rich for absolute top-tier minimalism standards.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). Imagery is rich (“cracked open the earth like an old book,” “numbers… whispered textures”) yet generally precise and non-contradictory. There’s some risk of over-ornamentation, but it doesn’t significantly obscure sense or momentum, and there are no notable loops or scaffold sentences. Opening and closing lines are especially strong, framing the piece with resonant images rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is excellent: images like “cobalt lagoon…like spilled ink beneath a bruised sky” and “kite bobbing above him like a jubilant ghost” are striking and apt. Most sentences multi-task—advancing action, mood, and theme simultaneously—without obvious scaffolding or loops. There is a slight tendency toward over-articulation in metacommentary lines that explain what the images already show, which edges into mild over-writing. Tightening those expository statements would easily raise this into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and often do double duty—advancing scene while building motif or atmosphere. Figurative language (e.g., wind as a curious child, lizards as living coins) is vivid and mostly well-chosen without sliding into muddle. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; the prose sustains momentum even during reflective passages. A few metaphors and abstractions cluster, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful repetition (“The tower did not answer. It absorbed.”), and largely clean syntax. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding muddle; metaphors (chemistry, vectors, equations) stay within a tightly chosen field. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym churn; most sentences advance both atmosphere and theme. A few lines verge on conceptual summary, but they don’t materially drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are varied in length and structure, images are vivid and mostly unmuddled, and almost every line carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, theme). The figurative density is ambitious but largely coherent, with very few strained metaphors; rhythm holds up well read aloud. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between images and actions remain clear. A touch of purple is evident, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or blunt the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly doing multiple jobs at once (world, emotion, theme) and the rhythms vary enough to keep the paragraphing from becoming sludge. Imagery is vivid and mostly precise—“ghost of ozone clinging to broken transmission towers,” “leaf…curled like a sleeping bat”—and avoids mixed metaphors. There is some redundancy and slight purple excess (e.g., repeating the long clause “scrapyard settlement spanning a cracked wasteland”), and several sentences could be tightened without loss, which undermines momentum a bit. Still, clarity is never in doubt and the final cadence on “resonance” is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, with high information density—most sentences are doing double duty for image, theme, and character. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; motifs repeat with variation rather than in loops, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative lines and shorter pivots at key moments (“Her breath caught. Not fear—recognition.”). A slight tendency toward lushness in spots doesn’t materially drag momentum or blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, tone, character) and the imagery is often striking. However, figurative language is nearly constant, leading to moments of purple density where fresh metaphors pile up without additional pressure (“gambits that sang like lullabies and endgames that wept like widows”). There is some conceptual redundancy around Elric’s ethos (apprentice of wonder, surrender, sacred playfulness) that could be trimmed for sharpness. Despite this excess, clarity remains high and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing thematic and atmospheric work simultaneously. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and constructs (“benevolently ruthless,” “luminous absence,” role-defining sentences), and a tendency toward abstraction that occasionally borders on pseudo-profundity. These habits don’t break clarity, but they slightly slow momentum and create a mild sense of sameness in texture. With a bit more pruning and variation, the line-level could rise to truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense with meaning, often doing multiple jobs at once, and metaphors are mostly precise and thematically coherent (books as tectonic plates, an egg hatching backward into sanctuary). A few moments flirt with excess or stacked imagery (“obsidian wind,” “dew-slicked tile,” “stormcloud leather”) that slightly risk saturation but do not obscure sense. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping, and momentum carries cleanly from start to finish. Tightening a handful of overly ornate phrases could elevate this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty for atmosphere and interiority (“That hush wasn’t absence—it was presence compressed…”). Metaphors are largely coherent and thematically linked to weaving, pattern, and breath; repetition patterns (“She…”) read intentional rather than mechanical. There is mild risk of density/purple-tinge in a few late abstractions (“a place where silence learned to speak, and mistakes learned to breathe”), but they remain legible and don’t obscure closure. Momentum never stalls; each paragraph adds new pressure or reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is notably strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, blending worldbuilding, mood, and character without visible scaffolding or loops. The figurative density is high but generally coherent (“glass birds nesting in rib cages” aligns with bone/fragility motifs) and rarely lapses into mixed metaphors. Rhythm supports pressure, tightening around the ritual beats and relaxing for dreamlike transitions. A couple of abstract generalizations could be compressed, but they do not significantly drag momentum or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in advancing setting, emotion, and theme. The figurative language is lush but largely coherent and purposeful, and syntactic variety keeps the piece from feeling mechanically patterned. That said, density of metaphor and abstraction is very high, especially in peak-pressure beats, edging toward purple and occasionally softening immediacy. Some trimming or grounding in more concrete, moment-to-moment sensation would sharpen impact at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally concise yet layered, doing multiple jobs (advancing scene, revealing character, building motif) without obvious scaffolding or repetition loops. The prose passes the read-aloud test with varied rhythms and purposeful paragraphing, especially around the shift into and out of the cave. Some metaphors sit close together and verge on purple—“temporary eternity,” “tidepools…deep enough to drown in, shallow enough to step out of unchanged”—but they don’t materially obscure sense or closure. Information is cleanly sequenced, with no noticeable grammar or clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, sensory-laden, and usually do more than one job, with few if any outright scaffolding or clarity issues. Images like “dawn was not yet light, but pressure—thick and expectant” are vivid and precise. That said, figurative density is high and occasionally borders on purple or repetitive thesis-restatement (“whispers traveled farther,” “this was how the world healed”), which slightly dulls momentum. Tightening a few redundant or over-explanatory lines would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, interiority, and theme) without obvious scaffold or repetition, and the figurative language is largely controlled and non-muddled. Recurrent motifs are purposefully echoed rather than looped, and the closing lines land with clear, precise images instead of purple haze. There is a high density of metaphor throughout, which flirts with saturation but rarely tips into obscurity or contradiction. A touch more restraint or variation in figurative weight at a few mid-paragraph points would sharpen momentum even further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are striking, and most carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, character) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but rarely feels gratuitous or muddled; metaphors like the orchard as an old ship or lung feel coherent and motif-driven. There are no notable paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. A few lines verge on abstraction (“the fractured grace of letting safety grow wild”) but remain anchored enough in prior imagery to avoid derailment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, with strong verbs and specific nouns (“crackled faintly,” “veil of mist,” “blade through gauze”) doing layered work for mood and meaning. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or ornamental padding. Information density is high; most sentences carry both atmosphere and character insight, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym-churn. The only ceiling here is that the descriptive lushness stays at a similar intensity throughout, so there’s less rhythmic contrast between discovery beats and quieter connective tissue than absolute top-tier work often achieves.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences vary in length and rhythm, images are generally clean and non-redundant, and nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. The prose leans dense and figurative but avoids mixed metaphors or obvious purple excess, and there is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping. Key beats—the chip’s inner glimmer, the breathing cavern, the final pack-and-leave—are rendered with clarity and momentum. A small trim of explicative phrases (especially in the last paragraph) could further sharpen the already strong cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most images do multiple jobs (world-building plus interior reflection). The prose leans lush—nearly every line is figurative—but metaphors are coherent and rarely mixed in a confusing way, so momentum holds. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; information density is high without becoming opaque. A few formulations (“a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer”) are slightly precious, but they don’t materially obscure cause/effect or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, often doing multiple jobs at once, and metaphors are generally apt and striking (“the shimmer between heartbeats,” “liquid starlight”). However, figurative density is very high throughout, with frequent stacked images (“burnt saffron, bruised indigo, the ghost of green”) that risk tipping into purple and slightly slowing momentum. There is some conceptual repetition around “presence,” “revaluation,” and “density” that could be trimmed for sharper impact. For an elite market, a bit more spareness and reliance on concrete emotional beats would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are mostly precise, and nearly every line advances either atmosphere, character, or thematic weight. Metaphor density is high but generally coherent and non-redundant; moments like “cartography of collapse” pull significant load. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the prose sustains momentum despite being reflective. A few phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t blur sense or harm the clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong, with vivid images (“glass reservoirs half-empty, waiting like lungs between breaths”) and efficient interleaving of description, thought, and action. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). There is a risk of purple density and slight repetition in certain motifs (“occluded views,” “map the emotional terrain”), and a few aphoristic lines in dialogue edge toward over-articulation of theme. Nonetheless, clarity holds throughout and momentum is acceptable for a lyric piece, with no significant scaffolding or loops dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose shows strong line-level craft: dense but generally efficient metaphors, varied syntax, and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Phrases like “wool soaked in honey” and “a bird’s beak parting fog” are vivid and sensorially precise, and most sentences do more than one job. There is a lot of figurative language per paragraph, which edges toward purple at points, but it rarely muddies clarity or slows momentum enough to harm the closure. With a light trim, this would be fully publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally free of redundancy or scaffolding; most lines do at least two jobs. The figurative language is thematically coherent (music, scent, imperfection) and rarely feels mixed or strained. There is a high density of metaphor, especially early on, which edges toward purple in spots and slightly risks numbing impact over the full piece. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the closing cadence is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, tone, and theme at once) and maintain momentum despite density. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful; images echo each other (spirals, breathing, hush) rather than stacking randomly. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding, and the final lines deliver a clean, potent cadence. A reader sensitive to purple prose might quibble at saturation, but clarity and control hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally excellent: dense, image-rich lines that do multiple jobs and maintain momentum, with strong control of sound and syntax. Repeated motifs (“razor edges,” squinting, surrender) and some near-parallel constructions flirt with over-insistence, but they form a legible pattern rather than mere redundancy. Sentences remain clear, and the closure image is not muddied by figurative overload. It’s high-level line craft with only minor risks of over-decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is polished and often striking, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“Each cap was a silent sentinel; each glow, a sentence in a language of angles and absences”). Syntax varies, and the prose maintains momentum despite its lyric density. However, metaphor and abstraction are heavily loaded—phrases like “quiet wildfire of pre-dawn understanding” and repeated formulations of “the physics of letting go” push toward purple and minor redundancy. Trimming or simplifying a few of the more portentous lines would sharpen impact without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; nearly every sentence advances character, mood, or concept, and the imagery is often striking (“shadows that moved against the wind’s direction,” “monitors beeping like slot machines”). There are no obvious loops, syntactic artifacts, or clarity issues, and the final paragraphs land cleanly. However, figurative and conceptual density is consistently high—stacked paradoxes, slogans, and quasi-mathematical aphorisms—which occasionally brushes purple and risks feeling overly curated. That slight over-richness in places is the primary limiter at this otherwise strong line level.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but generally precise; metaphors like cables as veins or spices as paint feel fresh and apt. There is a high frequency of figurative language, yet it rarely tips into muddle or redundancy, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once). Recurrent phrases (“cultivated estrangement,” “between the hum of streetlamps”) function as motifs rather than scaffolding. Momentum holds across the lyric exposition; no major line-level artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, and interiority) with few redundancies, and rhythm is varied and deliberate. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, with images of steeping, stitching, and covenant regeneration forming a consistent metaphorical field. A few phrases (“perfume of haunted euphoria,” “treaties or treaties broken”) flirt with purple or tautological, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Overall momentum is sustained despite lyric density, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (setting, theme, and character all at once), and very little scaffolding or repetition. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent; images like “velvet and static” or “alphabetizing canned goods” are fresh and specific rather than purple. Syntax varies nicely, creating an effective alternation between lush description and tighter, more sober lines near the end. Momentum never stalls despite lyricism, and the closure image is crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, largely free of redundancy, and often do double duty for atmosphere and character. The figurative density is high—nearly every line carries metaphor or sensory flourish—but images tend to cohere around a stable set of motifs (music, mapping, language, silence) rather than drifting into muddle. A few formulations (“the zero before the song, the breath before the scream, the love before the loss”) approach purple and slightly over-explain what is already clear in context, but they don’t obscure closure. Momentum is maintained despite the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and often do double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and there is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. The metaphoric density is very high—nearly every sentence carries an image—and while mostly coherent, it occasionally edges toward purple, risking reader fatigue in an elite-publication context. Still, clarity remains intact and the closure image (seeds/tense, blooming corrections) lands cleanly, so any overwriting is a minor rather than structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush but largely disciplined: metaphors about music, light, and tide are coherent and thematically aligned, and many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character. There is minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping, and the narrative maintains momentum despite its contemplative bent. A few phrases flirt with purple (“whispered secrets only the tide could remember,” “joyful sorrow of creation”) and the aphoristic lines verge on didactic, but they don’t seriously muddle clarity or closure. Overall, line-level craft is strong and publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, and information) and the rhythm supports the lyric-accumulative mode. There is some repetition of structure and intensifiers (“not... but...,” “The archive responded—”; stacked appositive clauses) that edges toward overwriting, but clarity remains intact. Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful, with only minor density excess in places. The final image sequence is clean and charged, with no major scaffolding or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is polished, with varied syntax, high information density, and multi-function sentences that carry image, emotion, and worldbuilding at once. Repetition patterns (e.g., “She drummed…” sequences) read as intentional incantation rather than accidental looping. However, metaphor density is high, occasionally skirting purple and risking saturation (“auroras trapped in glass,” “petri dish,” “mercury under constellations that blinked like distant monitors” in close proximity). Trimming a few stacked images would sharpen impact and raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line by line, the prose is lean, vivid, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in the world (steel canyons, folded truths), and the rhythm of paragraphs supports momentum. A few thematic restatements and slightly slogan-like phrases soften the impact but do not materially drag pace or clarity. Overall, this is polished, publication-ready prose with only minor tightening possible.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually do double duty for mood and mechanism (e.g., the mirror catching “fragments of light no eye should witness”). The prose occasionally flirts with over-saturation of metaphor and adjective—a near-constant lushness that risks flattening contrast—but remains clear and legible throughout. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony; sentence rhythms feel consciously arranged. The closing paragraphs, in particular, are clean and precise enough to support the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have musicality and variety, images are generally clear, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus interiority). The recurring imagery of mist, light, and trees is handled with control rather than brute repetition. There is some flirtation with purple prose and stacked figurative language, but it mostly stays legible and purposeful rather than muddy. I see no major scaffolding, loops, or syntactic artifacts that sap momentum or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is highly polished: metaphors are generally apt, sensory density is high, and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme). Repetitions like “It wasn’t sound—it was summons” and some stacked intensifiers around grief and regret verge on purple but stop short of obscuring clarity or momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere or character. A slight trim of the most self-consciously “profound” constructions would move this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with little slack, and the rhythm shifts effectively between clipped and more sinuous structures. Figurative language is rich but controlled—“shavings curling like ghosts,” “voice flat as parchment,” “remade hush”—and rarely feels mixed or overwrought. There’s some deliberate repetition in the narration of whittling that reads as pattern, not loop, and no major scaffolding or synonym churn. It stops short of the absolute top band only because a couple of high-level abstractions (“morally ambiguous,” “perfectly compliant”) tell what the surrounding images already show, slightly dulling the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is strong: images are precise, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (“lantern-moth hush,” the lake as a god clearing its throat), and there are few if any mixed metaphors or outright redundancies. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing modulate well between long, lush lines and briefer cadences for emphasis. The main limitation is the sheer density of figurative language, which occasionally risks softening momentum and clarity of emotional stakes. Even so, there are no serious artifacts, and the closure image reads clean and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences are musical, dense with image, and generally do double duty in character, setting, and theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and motif-driven (fire/ash/embers, resonance, roots and song), avoiding muddle or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; most lines feel necessary and alive. The only mild limitation is that the lushness is fairly constant, with few sharp cuts or bare sentences to spike pacing or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are mostly precise, and many lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and mood at once). Figurative language is dense, but the story teaches this pattern early and maintains clarity; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors or outright muddles. A few abstractions (“texture of connection,” “unoptimized, gloriously human resonance”) lean toward conceptual rather than sensory, softening impact slightly. Overall, the prose has momentum and high information density with only minor hints of purple.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong, often beautiful, with high information density and images that typically pull multiple weights (emotional, thematic, atmospheric) at once. There is a sustained figurative intensity—“time pooled here like spilled ink,” “curtains of intention,” “architecture bending slightly to cradle her intent”—that flirts with purple but mostly maintains clarity and coherence. A few metaphors and abstractions (“properly tended,” “magnetism of unfinished stories”) edge toward conceptual explanation rather than concrete enactment, softening momentum slightly. Overall, rhythm, syntax, and clarity survive the lyrical pressure, but a small trim would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is densely figurative yet largely precise: “rain-beaded skylight loft,” “thunder rolled like a forgotten bassline,” and “ink thick as memory” carry both sensory and conceptual weight. Information density is high, with most lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. At times the relentless metaphorization edges toward purple, but it doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure. Line-level rhythm and clarity remain strong through the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmically varied, densely packed, and generally do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in a single image). Metaphors are mostly coherent and vivid, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative density is very high across the whole piece, sometimes approaching purple and risking reader fatigue. A touch more sparseness in peak beats would sharpen impact and push this toward truly elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, mood, and character) without obvious redundancy, and metaphors (“dawn through stained glass,” “ink bleeding through parchment”) are vivid yet coherent. The prose skirts purple but maintains clarity, and repetition of key phrases (“softly deliberate,” “shadow unbound”) reads as patterning rather than scaffolding. There are no significant loops or structural artifacts that slow momentum or blur cause/effect. A touch more sparseness in a few descriptive clusters could make the peaks land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, with high information density, and most metaphors are precise and coherent (e.g., conviction as thin ice, embers as heartbeats). The prose largely avoids redundancy and scaffolding, and each paragraph meaningfully advances atmosphere, stance, or plan. There is some flirtation with overwriting and thematic repetition—explaining the metaphor of shedding and reconstruction more than once—that slightly blunts impact. Nonetheless, clarity and propulsion are never lost, including at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty (worldbuilding + emotion, or image + plot), and there’s little obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphoric density is high but generally coherent and legible; images like “hush stitched with awe and dread” and “coffee cups had left concentric rings…like tree rings” are apt rather than muddled. A few moments flirt with purple-prose saturation, yet they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall momentum holds; trimming one or two of the more ornate comparative phrases would tighten an already polished line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences are musical, information-dense, and multi-functional, with strong verbs and well-chosen metaphors. There is some tendency toward overstatement and repetition of conceptual phrasing near the end (theme sentences, lanterns on a river), which slightly blunts the closure’s impact. Even so, clarity and momentum are never in doubt, and figurative language remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in a single metaphor). Rhythm varies well between long, flowing sentences and sharper beats at moments of strain (“She began to trace. / Not one falling star, but dozens, hundreds…”). There is some risk of metaphor saturation and a few near-redundant formulations around stardust, voices, and cathedrals, but they largely read as intentional patterning rather than scaffolding. Overall clarity and momentum are preserved even at peak lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“gears rusted by paradox rather than time” is especially sharp). Rhythm is varied and generally propulsive for a lyric piece, and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The main drawback is density: figurative language appears in a very high proportion of lines, and while most metaphors are coherent, the cumulative effect skirts purple, slightly dulling impact by lack of contrast. Trimming a few stacked images would likely sharpen the strongest ones and lift this closer to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with metaphors that mostly cohere and pull double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., the gear “remembering weight”). There are few, if any, true loops or scaffolding lines; most sentences advance either world, character, or conceptual frame. Some figurative clusters and explicit philosophical sentences slightly blunt momentum and edge toward purple, but they do not obscure causality or the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for demanding venues, if a touch ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is lush and often beautiful, with many sentences doing triple duty for image, mood, and theme. Figurative density is high—nearly every line bears a metaphor or simile—which risks purple prose but mostly stays coherent and legible. There are no obvious loops or scaffolding; momentum is sustained despite the lyric pace. Slight over-saturation of imagery in places keeps this just shy of elite-every-line territory.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, pull multiple duties (worldbuilding, mood, character), and maintain clarity despite a high figurative density. Imagery generally feels coherent and purposeful—the recurring stain, frost, hymn, and mausoleum metaphors harmonize rather than clash. There is very little scaffolding or repetition; most lines advance either emotional pressure or atmospheric texture. A few phrases flirt with purple (“seraphically mundane,” “frostbitten hope”), but they remain legible and voice-true rather than becoming self-conscious decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and metaphors that are mostly clean and thematically aligned (ink, stone, stars, erosion). A few phrases flirt with purple or conceptual redundancy—e.g., “usurper stitched from stolen flesh and borrowed names,” “dense as grief”—but they do not obscure sense or closure. There is minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing, and the final lines land crisply. At a top-tier level, tightening a handful of intensifiers would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is musical and dense without usually tipping into purple, and most sentences do at least two jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Recurrent rhythmic constructions (“She tapped… She’d assemble… She began…”) feel deliberate and motif-driven rather than lazy templates, though a few lines veer into slogan (“The fossil fuel ban hadn’t saved the reefs. But listening had.”). Clarity remains strong even in figurative stretches; cause/effect and images are never obscured by ornament. Minor overtness in a couple of closing lines is the only notable drag.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are striking (“stars blinked like scattered embers,” “silence pressed like velvet against the ears”) and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and characterization together). The prose occasionally edges toward density, with frequent figurative language and piled modifiers, but it remains legible and rhythmic rather than bogging down. There are some conceptual repetitions (variations on hum/thrum, serenity/clarity) that could be tightened without loss. Overall, momentum holds, and the final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and metaphors that largely reinforce rather than obscure (“cracks spiderwebbed… not breaking, but blooming”). Repetition is purposeful (“soil remembered,” “steam curled”) rather than looped, and sentences almost always do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + emotion + theme). The prose is lush but mostly stops short of purple; only a few abstractions (“quiet recalibration,” “a language of root and rupture”) flirt with vagueness without derailing clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing support momentum toward the embryo’s unsealing and dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are generally clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; many lines do double duty for setting, character, and theme (“The paper fibers have memorized my fingers’ tremors…”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and coherent, and the motifs (pearl, shell, web, glass) interrelate without muddle. There’s mild risk of over-ornamentation, yet momentum holds and the closure image remains clear. I see no significant loops or scaffolding; almost every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and metaphors that mostly interlock around recurring motifs (tarot, stitching, architecture, gravity, light). Rhythm varies in a controlled way, sustaining momentum despite a contemplative mode. The primary limitation is occasional flirtation with purple prose or abstraction that could risk saturation (“chorus of echoes, none daring to lead”; “unborn colors”), though it doesn’t obscure closure. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding; nearly every sentence pulls weight for atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but generally precise, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“ephemeral patterns,” “language written in absence”). Figurative language is rich yet coherent—ink, time, trauma, and erosion motifs align rather than clash. There are no significant loops or scaffolding phrases; momentum holds even in reflective lines. A slight risk of purple-leaning texture in a few moments keeps it just below absolute top-band craft, but clarity and cadence remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly disciplined, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“She had once believed archives were tombs; now she understood they were kindling.”). Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones, particularly around the activation of the Resonance Table. There is some tendency toward abstraction and stacked modifiers (“bravely conflicted storm,” “scandalize-worthy spark,” “weaponized vulnerability”), flirting with purple but not obscuring sense or momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding drag the piece, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level writing is polished and dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“She inculcated plants with values—patience in the slow unfurling of buds…”). Rhythm varies well between long, flowing descriptive lines and shorter declarative pivots; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors cluster thickly enough to flirt with purple, but they remain coherent and tonally aligned rather than muddled. Nothing at the close is obscured by overwriting or artifact, so momentum and clarity are preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is lush, image-dense, and mostly precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“silence hummed louder than any storm,” “the sky became floor. The silence became teeth.”). The repetition of metaphoric texture around sound and inversion feels pattern-taught rather than accidental purple prose. There is some risk of over-saturation—nearly every line is figurative—which slightly blurs propulsion, but causality and closure remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, psychology, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is dense but thematically coherent (ghosts over charts, orbits, smoke-thread stitching), rarely crossing into muddle or mixed metaphor. Rhythm varies well, with short declarative lines (“She hadn’t asked for details. / She didn’t need them.”) punctuating longer, braided sentences to maintain momentum. A few lines verge on purple or aphoristic, but they don’t significantly blunt clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (world, emotion, and theme often carried together). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent to the sound/star/technology palette, and there are few, if any, mixed metaphors that confuse sense. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every line bears an image—which a very demanding editor might trim for sharpness, but propulsion and clarity remain intact. There are no notable loops, scaffolds, or syntactic templates that bog momentum, including at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, often doing double-duty for atmosphere and character, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled and sensical (“mist curled like breath,” “air… viscous with withheld confession”), and the rhythm reads smoothly aloud. The density of metaphor borders on purple in places, risking saturation in a longer piece, but here it remains legible and supports the accumulative drive. No major artefacts, tense slips, or clarity issues mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double-duty, blending atmosphere, theme, and interiority without obvious scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent (“ash clung… like powdered grief,” “voice low but carrying like struck bronze”) and not so dense as to obscure meaning. There is some conceptual repetition around mercy’s redefinition and “cradling empathy in arms of steel,” which edges toward rhetorical excess but doesn’t stall momentum. Overall, rhythm and syntax are varied and readable, though a slight trim of abstractions would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence-level craft is generally high: varied syntax, few redundancies, and images that often pull double-duty for mood and world-building. Some stretches flirt with purple prose via stacked metaphors and modifiers (“half-remembered aria caught in twilight”; “blossoms that chimed when the wind stirred”), which slightly slows momentum in a short form that might benefit from a few plainer beats. Crucial actions and turns (the coin spin, the seven-note song, the final planting) remain clear and uncluttered. Tightening a handful of descriptive sentences would sharpen impact without harming the lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, concrete, and multitask (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme often ride the same line). Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and vivid, with few, if any, mixed or confusing images; rhythm supports the contemplative but tense mood. There is some risk of purple prose and a slight drag from consistently elevated diction, but momentum and clarity never meaningfully suffer. No significant loops, scaffolding, or technical errors appear.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is generally tight, with high information density—most sentences develop world, character, and concept simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-true, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition; the prose sustains momentum even in descriptive stretches. A few formulations (“factually mystical,” “pure affect”) edge toward abstraction or self-consciousness, slightly cooling immediacy. Overall, the craft is strong and polished, if not entirely free of minor purple notes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: imagery is often striking (“sand falling not as time, but as truth shedding its skin”; “sigh trapped in glass”), and sentences typically do more than one job (worldbuilding plus theme plus character). There is some density of metaphor and abstractions (“truth unraveled,” “raw possibility”) verging on purple in accumulation, but clarity remains intact. Repetition of similar sentence shapes and conceptual phrasing exists, yet doesn’t tip into obvious loops or scaffolding. With a touch more restraint and variation, this would move into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, images often do double duty, and rhythm generally supports the contemplative, high-stakes mood. Metaphors (“broken promise,” “scattered pages of an unread book,” “name no longer ash, but compost”) are mostly apt and thematically linked rather than decorative. There is some repetition and near-purple layering of figurative language, particularly in the last third, that risks slight heaviness and could be tightened. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and no major scaffolding or loops undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of images that usually do multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, and character). However, figurative language is very frequent, and some conceptual clusters (“distill,” “percolate,” “palimpsest,” “essence,” “truth”) risk feeling slightly overdetermined and repetitive rather than sharpened. There are no serious clarity issues or mixed metaphors, but a few lines summarize theme where the imagery already suffices. With a touch more pruning and reliance on the strongest images, this would move into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and image-rich, with many sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once), and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few metaphors verge on purple or self-conscious (“liquid regret,” “timeline not yet broken”), but they remain coherent and don’t muddle sense or closure. Momentum holds despite the lyric density; each paragraph advances understanding or recharges motifs rather than circling. Final images are cleanly rendered and rhythmically well-placed, giving the piece a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but largely efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character (“her wistfully pragmatic hands never mistaking sentiment for sustenance”). Figurative language is frequent yet mostly controlled, with images like “spilled mercury” and “measuring hope by millimeters” feeling precise rather than gratuitous. There are very few scaffold or paraphrase loops, and syntax varies enough to give a strong read-aloud rhythm. A couple of phrases (“quivering hush,” “protected vulnerability”) approach abstraction, but they don’t significantly obscure clarity or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is very strong: sentences are varied, rhythmic, and information-dense, and metaphors generally cohere (echoes, tides, hums, reflections) without collapsing into mush. The prose occasionally leans toward the purple, but repetition patterns (“She did not…”) and charged parallelisms feel intentional rather than scaffolding. There are no evident loops, syntactic glitches, or figurative muddles that obscure action or closure. A touch more sparseness in a few philosophizing lines could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences do triple duty for mood, worldbuilding, and theme; rhythm is varied; and images are often striking (“a dream carved in alabaster,” “names he’d carried like stones in his pockets”). However, the density of figurative language occasionally tips into overwriting, with stacked abstractions (“petrichor and possibility,” “quiet prismatic tapestry”) and near-synonymous spiritual phrases. There are minor redundancies in sentiment that could be cut for even greater impact. The prose is close to elite but would benefit from some tightening and pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and often do double duty for atmosphere and information (“vibrated beneath human hearing yet rattled her molars like distant thunder”). Figurative language is vivid but not so dense as to bog momentum, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. A few formulations edge toward purple or on-the-nose metaphor (“poisoned violin,” “language of stars”) but remain coherent and in tone. Pacing is well-controlled; no paragraph feels expendable or looped.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, generally high information density, and images that do double duty for mood and worldbuilding (“dust motes that danced like forgotten spirits,” “blueprint of spatial mutiny”). Some figurative language verges on purple and a few abstractions cluster in the thematic explanation near the end, but they do not significantly blur clarity or momentum. There are no serious loops or scaffold sentences, just an occasional slightly redundant flourish. Minor copy issues aside, the prose is publication-ready with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (atmosphere, character, theme) with good rhythm, and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Images like “mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible” and “furrowed hush” are vivid and tonally apt, though the density of figurative language edges toward purple in places. The prose remains clear even when metaphor-heavy; cause and effect are never obscured. A bit more restraint or variation in image register in the middle section would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and the prose generally pushes forward without scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, sustaining a cohesive metaphorical field around storms, maps, and memory. There are a few near-purple moments and intensifiers (“glaciers wept into steam,” “dawn itself were being rewound”) that risk excess but don’t obscure meaning or causality. No major loops, template cadences, or clarity issues undercut the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is lush, image-dense, and largely precise; many sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding. Rhythm and syntax vary, and the prose reads cleanly despite its complexity. At the same time, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, edging into over-saturation; occasional abstractions (“a cartography of pixelated amnesty”) risk blurring immediacy. This keeps the piece just shy of the extreme tautness and economy expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and often do double duty for character, setting, and theme (“bills as maps,” “fossilized serpent” of the train). There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm flows well across paragraphs. The main weakness is a mild tendency toward aphoristic formulations that can feel a bit pre-packaged, which slightly blunts immediacy in peak thematic moments. Still, clarity, control, and vivid phrasing dominate, and no significant artifacts impede momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty, advancing both worldbuilding and emotional texture, and the metaphorical language is often striking without becoming nonsensical. There are minor tendencies toward thematic repetition and abstraction in the final third (“grief, when shared, turned to grace”), which slightly dulls the sharpness of earlier imagery. Momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode; very few sentences feel like scaffolding or filler. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-consistent, avoiding serious purple-prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level work is strong: metaphors are generally coherent and layered, and many sentences pull multiple weights (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). There is some density bordering on purple—strings like “her guarded heart a fortress of moss and marrow, built to withstand the erosion of memory, the siege of regret” are lush enough to slow momentum slightly. Repetition of structures (“She saw… She saw… She saw…”) is purposeful but contributes to a heavy cadence. Still, clarity is never lost, and the final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding, and repetition (“after the future arrived early”) is patterned rather than accidental. Imagery is coherent and thematically aligned; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors or dead phrases. That said, the density of figurative language is high across almost every sentence, which slightly blurs emphasis and risks reader fatigue in such a short span. A bit more spareness around pivotal moments (the planting of the clipping, the covenant’s stirring) would let them hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and imagistic, but the figurative language is mostly coherent and multi-functional, advancing character, world, and theme simultaneously. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase; nearly every line carries new information or emotional shading. While the imagery approaches purple at times, it maintains internal logic and does not obscure causality or the closure beat. A light trim in a few metaphor-heavy lines could sharpen momentum, but line-level craft is already at a publishable tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is controlled and evocative with high information density—most sentences do double duty for character and atmosphere. Metaphors like “erosion—slow, inevitable, like wind scouring shale” are apt and not over-stacked, and repetition (e.g., “confidently uncertain”) feels deliberate rather than looped. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the final lines land with clarity and rhythmic poise.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence-level craft is polished: varied rhythms, dense but functional metaphors, and almost no scaffolding or paraphrase-loops. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (script, resonance, thresholds) and rarely feels gratuitous. A couple of phrases flirt with abstraction or familiar poeticism (“space between breaths, between glyphs”) yet do not blur causality or the closure image. Overall, the prose would require minimal line-editing for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: rich figurative language, minimal scaffolding, and high information density—most sentences carry setting, theme, and character simultaneously. Some metaphors stack densely (e.g., the creel holding “scales… nets… scent…”) and repetition of abstract nouns (wonder, contradiction, migrate) skirts purple, but clarity generally survives. There are no significant loops, syntactic monotony, or artifacts that dull the closure image. A light tightening of a few over-explanatory lines could lift it to truly elite prose.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished and rhythmically aware, with many sentences doing double duty for image and psychology (“Its surface smooth as a held breath”). There’s impressive information density without major scaffolding or syntactic clutter, and the closure image is clear and strong. The main limitation is occasional purple density and explanatory repetition (“latent radiance” + explicit unpacking) that could be pared for even sharper momentum. A touch more variation between lush description and plain, cutting lines during peak beats would enhance impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple layers of work (image, emotion, theme) and rhythm varies effectively. Metaphors are generally apt (“bellows… wheezed like regret,” “graffiti tags layered like geological strata”) and seldom feel mixed or ornamental. There is some density of figurative language, but it’s patterned and purposeful rather than purple, and there’s little redundancy. Minor repetition of concepts (“daringly methodical”) is not enough to meaningfully drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) and the rhythm is thoughtfully modulated, especially around turn-points like opening the “Apologies Swallowed Whole” volume and facing the mirror. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and on-theme—metaphors of letters, ciphers, echoes, and delays interlock rather than clash. There is mild density/purple risk (almost every line is charged), which could fatigue some readers, but clarity and momentum remain intact and the closure image is clean. Little to no scaffolding or redundancy appears.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong—many sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, and character) and the rhythm generally propels rather than clogs. However, figurative density is very high across nearly every sentence (“mulberries,” “perforated destiny,” “mulberry ache,” “tiny lanterns”), creating a mild sense of over-ornamentation and occasional redundancy. Some metaphors reiterate similar emotional notes without adding pressure, which slightly dulls impact in peak beats. Syntax and grammar are clean, with no clarity-breaking artifacts, but a light pruning would sharpen momentum for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are syntactically varied, images are mostly precise, and nearly every line carries dual weight for atmosphere and theme. Occasional density (“threading silence through silence,” multiple stacked metaphors per paragraph) edges toward purple, but clarity remains intact and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Rhythm suits the meditative pressure profile. This is strong, near-publishable prose that could benefit from a light paring for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing triple duty for setting, character, and theme (“her thoughts grew quiet, clear, like wine settling in a cask”). Sentence rhythm is controlled and varied, with no major scaffolding or paraphrase loops. However, figurative language is very frequent—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor—which risks a touch of purple and can blur emphasis. Trimming a few stacked images would likely sharpen impact without sacrificing music.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite their lyricism, doing double duty for mood and character while maintaining clarity and forward motion. Images like the cloak pooling “like shadow given form” and the wind threading her hair “like a benediction” are apt and not overextended. There is some density of figurative language, but it remains coherent and doesn’t tip into muddle or redundancy. I see minimal scaffold or repetition; the prose sustains momentum through the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and vivid phrasing that often accomplishs atmosphere, worldbuilding, and theme in the same line. Sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are few—if any—true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. A tendency toward lush abstraction (“pure temporal notation,” “the delay between cause and consequence”) occasionally edges toward ornateness, but it doesn’t seriously obscure sense. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready, with only minor risk of purple excess in a few concept-heavy phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and musical, with strong imagery and generally clean syntax; it reads aloud smoothly. Some phrases and concepts recur (“centuries of layered dust,” motion vs direction) in ways that verge on redundancy but mostly feel like deliberate motif rather than looped scaffolding. Figurative language is dense yet coherent; metaphors extend and echo rather than clash. The mild risk is occasional purple or explanatory phrasing, but it doesn’t significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, often doing multiple jobs, with vivid but generally controlled imagery (“like memory to regret,” “like captured dawn”). There’s little scaffolding or redundancy, and momentum holds despite a reflective mode. Some metaphors and abstractions cluster (“sacred,” “wonder,” explicit thesis lines), edging toward purple or preachy in the final paragraph, which trims the very top of the band. Overall, clarity and rhythm remain high with no major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and interior stakes) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose reads clean aloud. Metaphors are generally precise and coherent (books as anemones, ship’s groans as a symphony), and there are no major mixed images or syntax glitches. The density of figurative language occasionally flirts with purple, especially where several metaphors stack in close succession, which can slightly blur rather than sharpen impact. Nonetheless, closure images (lantern winking out, ledger pulsing once, his walk without lighting lamps) land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences vary in length, metaphors are mostly clean, and information density is high with little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose sustains a lush, metaphor-rich register without losing basic clarity of action or stakes. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous (“dying pulsar,” “sugar in hot tea,” “last amber star,” “universe remembering how to breathe”), bordering on purple in aggregate and occasionally rephrasing the same abstract ideas (meaning, resonance, purpose). A touch more spareness in peak beats would sharpen impact, but the current draft is still publishable-level with firm trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level work is strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning (“its ink faded into ghosts of leviathans and whirlpool-eyed krakens” is both visual and thematic). However, there is some overwriting and repetition of key metaphors and phrases (echo/forgotten phrases/frost on ribs) that slightly blunts impact. One noticeable glitch (“the echoes forgotten phrases”) and occasional stacked modifiers push the prose toward purple in places. Overall momentum holds, but tighter pruning and tidying would be required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are inventive but generally coherent (“cosmic ledgers yawned open,” “equations curling like vines”). The prose borders on lush but rarely tips into muddle; each figurative move tends to add either world logic or character shading. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding—almost every line advances atmosphere, method, or stakes. Momentum holds smoothly through long sentences because syntax is well-controlled and action sequencing stays clear.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are well-shaped, varied in rhythm, and dense with meaning, often doing atmospheric and thematic work simultaneously. Figurative language (“rooftops… like the knuckles of a drowning man”) is vivid and largely coherent without lapsing into purple excess or mixed metaphors. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; exposition is compact and purposeful. A few lines stack abstractions (“threads of story that bound strangers to ghosts”) but they remain clear and earned by concrete buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and information-dense; many sentences do double duty, advancing scene and theme through tight metaphors (e.g., flame “like a lover hesitant to wake a dreamer”). Rhythm is largely excellent and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. That said, figurative language is very frequent—nearly every line bears an image—which edges toward overwriting and occasionally risks blurring impact through sheer density. Slight pruning or variation in plainness versus ornament would sharpen already-strong line-level craft to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied yet smooth, and most carry multiple functions (world, mood, character) without padding. Imagery like “silence screamed” and “stone dropped in still water” is vivid but not overwrought, and repetition (e.g., burden, buckle, silence) feels pattern-driven rather than looped. There is minimal scaffolding or synonym churn; rhythm supports the quiet tension. A few abstract formulations could be trimmed, but they don’t harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences pull double duty for setting, theme, and emotion—and the overall rhythm reads well aloud. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful (“a body shaped by paradox,” “a loom weaving forward”), avoiding mixed metaphors or serious purple excess. There is some conceptual repetition around ego, identity, and narrative that could be tightened, and a few abstractions slightly blur immediacy. Nonetheless, momentum holds, and the closing images land cleanly without line-level clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) with minimal waste, and figurative language is vivid and coherent (“spiraled like a question mark made flesh” is a standout). There is some density of metaphor and modifer (“storm-born silence,” “liquid mercury,” “hymn,” “cathedral”), but it doesn’t muddle meaning or obscure causality. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little to no obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The slight risk of purple excess in a few phrases is the only real drag on an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong information density and many lines doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “He macerates the silence until it bleeds sound”). Rhythm is generally well-varied, and repetition (“He macerates grief,” “mournfully eager”) is mostly pattern-driven rather than accidental. However, there is some drift toward overstatement and paraphrase loops—several sentences restate the same idea about tending to silence/absence, and the “Because…” run at the end edges into redundantly explicating what the imagery already conveyed. These choices slightly dull momentum but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and information-dense—most sentences do triple duty in image, mood, and micro-worldbuilding, and the final paragraphs land with clarity. Metaphoric language is generally coherent and fresh (“cathedrals built from silence,” “tea into bone-dry clay”), and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. However, figurative density is extremely high nearly throughout, with metaphor on almost every line, which borders on purple and briefly blurs edges between concrete and conceptual action. That ornamental excess slightly dulls propulsion and keeps this just shy of elite line-level minimalism.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid and rarely mixed, and most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing ritual action, character, and theme together). There is some density of metaphor (“twilight thickened into indigo syrup,” “frost trailing from his boots like lace”) but it generally remains legible and purposeful. Minor redundancy and abstract phrasing around the core concept (“creative destruction,” “stifling destiny,” “contingent creation”) create brief patches of conceptual rather than sensory texture, slightly slowing momentum. Overall, the prose passes the read-aloud test with varied rhythm and clear sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme) without obvious scaffolding, and the read-aloud rhythm largely holds. Figurative language is generally apt and controlled, and loops/near-duplicates are rare. There is a mild drift into density and repetition of certain coinages (“serenely electric,” multiple “shard”/“fragment” framings) that edges toward purple in places but doesn’t obscure clarity or closure. Overall propulsion is good for a lyric piece, though a touch of pruning could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly tight, vivid, and multi-functional, with good variation in length and a clear read-aloud rhythm; there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Imagery is consistently marine and temporal, which gives the piece a unified texture rather than a grab bag of metaphors. The main weakness is mild purple-prose creep—nearly every line reaches for a metaphor or heightened phrase—which risks numbing impact over the span of the story, though clarity is never lost. With a touch more restraint or contrast, this would read as fully elite.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and images that carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) in single sentences. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful—“Marble cracked into lace” and “Staircases dissolved into ribbons of shadow” are evocative without muddling action. Momentum rarely stalls; description and interiority are well-interleaved. The main constraint is a slight tendency toward conceptual repetition around connection/memory that brushes against, but doesn’t quite cross into, over-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, varied in rhythm, and image-rich without tipping into full purple prose, and most lines do more than one job (world-building plus theme, or setting plus character). Recurring phrases like “somber marvel” and “unfolded horizons” feel intentional rather than repetitive scaffolding. Expository passages about alien-folded space, GPS obsolescence, and edge geometry are dense but clear and do not significantly stall momentum at this length. There are no obvious loops, mixed metaphors, or mechanical errors to undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and a high density of concrete and figurative language that usually pulls its weight. Images tend to cohere around sound, vibration, and moisture, giving the piece a unified sensory logic. There is mild risk of purple-ness—many lines reach for metaphor—but the figurative load rarely muddies clarity or stalls momentum. A touch more restraint in the closing paragraph could heighten impact by letting the strongest images stand uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal redundancy, and the imagery is vivid yet generally controlled. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and anchored, creating a rich texture rather than purple haze. Rhythm varies nicely, especially around the activation of the chamber and the tide’s return. The only ceiling comes from density—a few lines stack metaphor on metaphor in ways that could be fractionally pared to heighten impact under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, evocative, and information-dense, with images often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme (ink as neural pathways, snow as pressure against glass “like a held breath”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and never so piled-on that it obscures sense; there are few if any genuine loops or scaffolding lines. A couple of phrases lean toward abstract/purple (“cartography of lost data seeking shape”), but they remain intelligible and in-voice. Overall momentum is maintained despite the lyric density, and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense yet purposeful: most sentences carry at least two jobs (worldbuilding + mood, or theme + character), and rhythm varies effectively with pressure. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors like “consonants that dissolved like salt in rain” and “the brittle snap of resolve” are clear, sensorial, and thematically apt rather than ornamental. There are a few moments of near-lushness where images stack (“its internal fractures catching light like trapped screams”) but they remain legible and do not muddy causality or closure. No significant scaffold, synonym loops, or mechanical cadences undercut momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character at once). The prose sustains a lush, metaphor-heavy style with good rhythm and few redundancies; transitions between exposition, action, and image are smooth. At times the figurative stacking (“collapsing stars…abandoned satellites…black holes”) approaches purple, and a slight trimming could heighten impact by contrast. Nonetheless, causality stays clear and the closure image is sharp, so ornamentation never seriously muddies comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense but mostly earns its richness: images like “dew from their eye sockets, pooling at their feet” and “wind-chimes woven from moonlight” are vivid and legible, and sentences often do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Repetition patterns (“She played…”) feel rhythmic rather than scaffolding, and there’s little true redundancy. The main risk is occasional purple tilt and explicit summarizing lines near the end, which slightly dull the razor edge of the closing image. Overall, the line-level craft is strong, musical, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet disciplined, with strong verbs and dense images doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, tone, and character all at once. There are occasional stacked metaphors and intensifiers (“ozone and regret,” “brittle hush,” “constellations drawn in ash”) but they remain coherent and rarely feel redundant. Momentum is maintained despite a lyrical mode; each sentence tends to add either a new facet of world logic or deepen emotional stakes. Trimming one or two decorative flourishes in high-pressure beats could sharpen impact further, but line-level craft is already publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean despite lyricism, with many doing double duty (worldbuilding plus mood, or theme plus action), and the closing cadence is particularly well-judged. Figurative language—“syrup,” “caramel ghosts,” “cathedral of whimsy,” “reliquary of joy”—is vivid and generally coherent, and repetition patterns (silence, bells, mist) feel intentional rather than accidental. That said, the density of metaphor and modifiers edges toward purple in spots, and a ruthless elite-market edit would likely trim a few adornments without loss. There are no significant clarity lapses or scaffolding loops, so momentum remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and highly controlled, with dense but largely precise figurative language and a strong ear for rhythm (“Not like origami, but like memory: sudden, seamless, saturated with scent and sound”). Information density is high; most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. A few moves (“Not metaphorically.” repeated, and some stacked metaphors) flirt with over-richness but stop short of obscuring sense or dulling the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready, though at times it verges on luxuriant where a sharper cut could intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush yet mostly disciplined, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding, mood, and character (“audio reels whispering lullabies in dead dialects”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically unified around light, sea, and memory, avoiding mixed metaphors or outright purple muddle. There is little redundancy or scaffold; momentum flows smoothly from description into the culminating act of mixing and painting light. At an elite standard, a slight trimming of ornament in the middle backstory blocks could sharpen impact further, but line-by-line craft is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is polished: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, mood, motion) and read smoothly aloud. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and purposeful (“moss that remembered ancient footsteps,” “air thick with cosmic dust and whispered histories”). There is mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every line is lush—which slightly blurs urgency and can feel purple at moments, but clarity is never truly lost. Redundancy and scaffolding are minimal, and the final cadence is strong and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished: images are vivid but generally non-redundant, and many sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once). Repetition (“not grief, but vacancy”) and parallelism are purposeful and support cadence rather than feeling like scaffolding. A few lines edge toward density that could verge on purple in a longer piece, but here the tight scope and consistent metaphor set prevent muddle. There are no noticeable grammatical or clarity issues, and momentum remains intact despite the lyrical style.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished: images are original, layered, and seldom redundant, and nearly every sentence advances both mood and information. Repetitions (“This is how she reads the past,” “This is the cost…”) function as intentional structural anchors rather than scaffolding. Metaphors (topological reading of time, exile as being “paused”) are coherent with the world’s logic and avoid mixed or overextended vehicles. Line-level density is high but controlled; there is no real padding or template cadence to cut.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, images are generally coherent, and most lines do double duty for atmosphere and character. However, figurative language is nearly continuous (“parapet trembling… not from instability, but resonance,” “budding hope,” “lullaby made visible”), risking saturation and occasional redundancy. This lushness slightly blunts momentum in what is already a low-conflict scene. Still, clarity is maintained and there are no significant scaffolding or syntactic artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences pull double duty for image and concept, and the rhythm moves from lush description into sharper beats around the climactic unraveling. Metaphors (liquid whispers, barnacles of guilt, the needle as vow) are mostly coherent and thematically aligned. There is some density and repetition around “silence” and “hush” that edges toward purple, but it doesn’t obscure sense or closure. Scaffolding or paraphrase loops are minimal; prose maintains momentum through an essentially static physical situation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) and generally maintain clarity despite high figurative density. The recurring motifs (tearing, spirals, breath, silence as vessel) create cohesion rather than redundancy, and there’s little true synonym-churn or scaffolding. A few moments verge on purple or overpacked metaphor (“each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss”), nudging toward saturation, but they don’t obscure cause/effect or the closure image. Overall momentum holds well for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, dense with meaning, and often do double duty for image and theme (“ocean currents whispered like librarians shushing the deep”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, building a consistent symbolic ecology around libraries, transmissions, and physics. There are a few moments where abstractions stack (“physics of letting go,” “mass converting to light”) and edge toward conceptual repetition rather than fresh embodiment, but they do not significantly drag momentum. Overall, clarity and propulsion survive the lyric density, and the final image sequence reads clean and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and imagistic but generally precise, with most metaphors feeling coherent and on-theme (code, weather, sound, printing/pressing). Information density is high; sentences usually advance atmosphere, character, and concept at once, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few lines flirt with purple abstraction (“time stretched like taffy,” “tinkersong wonder”) yet stay legible and don’t obscure causality or the closure image. The line-level rhythm—especially in the series of color-coded encoding strokes and the “Steel met steel” triad—supports momentum rather than bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density—many lines do double duty for setting, emotion, and theme. Syntax varies and generally maintains momentum, and there are no significant clarity or grammar issues. However, figurative language is nearly constant, sometimes stacking (“lenses cracked like frozen rivers under moonlight,” “gilding the spire in liquid gold”), which borders on purple and risks numbing impact. A few sentences slightly paraphrase prior ideas (joy beneath/within sorrow), adding mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs, concrete images, and sentences that usually do multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) without clear padding. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and on-theme; mixed metaphors are avoided and rhythm is varied enough to prevent monotony. There is minor purple-leaning density—nearly every sentence is metaphorically charged—which slightly blurs impact in places where a plainer line might sharpen contrast. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) without obvious scaffolding, and rhythm varies to match shifts between intense making and still listening. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically unified around light, texture, and celestial mapping, avoiding mixed metaphors that would blur sense. There is some repetition of structures and motifs, yet it reads as deliberate patterning rather than looped padding, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective tilt. The prose occasionally brushes purple, but never enough to obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush, often doing multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, mood, characterization) with strong rhythm and minimal scaffolding. Metaphors like “balloon skin shimmered with stranded luminance—light caught mid-flight, never quite landing” are vivid and controlled, and descriptive density rarely stalls momentum. There is a mild risk of over-ornamentation in places, but figurative language remains coherent and purposeful rather than showy for its own sake. Line-level clarity and propulsion are high, with no obvious loops or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with almost every line doing two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or theme plus image). Metaphors are generally apt and build a unified texture around clocks, ice, light, and sound. That said, figurative language is near-constant and occasionally risks feeling overwrought, which slightly blunts momentum in places. Trimming a few modifiers and letting some concrete actions sit unadorned would sharpen the impact and elevate this toward elite-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: many sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood, and the prose often has a musical cadence (“Her whispers didn’t echo; they rooted”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly apt, with only a few slightly purple or self-conscious turns that don’t derail clarity. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and action is easy to follow even in dense descriptive passages. The final paragraph lands crisply without muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, with dense, multi-tasking images and mostly clean syntax; nearly every sentence carries atmosphere or concept. However, figurative language is layered in almost every line, producing occasional purple-thickness that risks numbing impact (“a silence thicker than marrow—what the ancients called a pane of hush” plus similar intensities stacked). There are mild repetition patterns and synonymic echoes that could be trimmed for even greater sharpness and propulsion. None of this breaks clarity or closure, but it does slow momentum enough to keep the prose out of the very top band for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful and coherent—“paths twisted back on themselves like knotted rope” clarifies rather than obscures. There’s little to no scaffolding, redundancy, or mechanical repetition, and action remains clear despite the lyricism. At times the density of imagery softens immediacy in the midsection, but not enough to sap momentum or cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, theme, character) and the rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, with especially effective phrases like “not as a wound, but as a watermark.” Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and coherent—braiding, phase change, metamorphosis, and music form a tight semantic field. There are a few places where abstraction or explicit statement could be pruned (e.g., some direct grief reframings) to let images work harder, but there’s no real paraphrase looping or metaphor muddle that harms closure. Overall momentum is maintained despite reflective density.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are generally coherent, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus mood). Figurative language is dense but controlled; metaphors extend a few central motifs rather than scattering in unrelated directions. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the cadence of the final paragraphs supports the accumulating, ledger-like structure. A few phrases flirt with purple (“slow and syrupy, swallowing fragments of old myths”) yet they don’t significantly obscure sense or blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal scaffolding, and there are few if any true redundancies. Figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent and thematically cohesive (coral, ice, tides, sanding), avoiding mixed metaphors that break sense. The risk is occasional purple-prose saturation, where stacked images feel slightly ornamental and could be pruned without harming clarity or pressure. Momentum holds, and closure imagery is clear and undulled by stylistic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing triple duty (setting, mood, theme). Images like “grain-dust, between collapse and confession” and “dust puffing from its seams like exhaled relief” are fresh and apt. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, occasionally feeling like aesthetic saturation that risks dulling impact. A touch more restraint or contrast in plainness would sharpen the best lines even further.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is lush, mostly precise, and sonically attentive; many sentences do double duty for image and psychology (“a promotion that felt like a burial, a love that dissolved like sugar in black coffee”). The metaphor systems—neural, geological, nautical—are fairly well integrated, with only occasional crowding where abstractions could be trimmed. There is some repetition of key terms (“synaptic plasticity,” “modify”) that borders on thematic hammering but remains purposeful rather than scaffolding. Overall momentum holds; the density of figurative language is high but controlled enough not to blur sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally tight, syntactically varied, and multi-functional, carrying worldbuilding, mood, and plot together. Metaphors and sensory images (vipers, powdered stars, liquid glass) are vivid and mostly coherent, with few mixed or confusing constructions. There is some risk of purple prose due to the density of figurative language, but it rarely obscures meaning or momentum. Minor trimming of repeated modifiers (“clandestinely luminous,” “pulsing,” “whispering”) could heighten impact, yet the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is lush but mostly precise, with images like “roots spiraled like frozen smoke” and “porcelain skin” doing multiple jobs (world, character, theme) at once. Figurative language is dense yet coherent; there are few if any mixed metaphors, and momentum is preserved despite the lyricism. A slight tendency toward saturation and explicit thematic labeling in the last third keeps it just below the very top band for elite markets. Overall, it demonstrates strong technical control and read-aloud musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally fluent with strong rhythm and high information density; many sentences carry setting, character, and theme simultaneously. However, abstractions and stacked metaphors accumulate (“translate silence into strategy, loss into lyric, exile into exploration”), edging into overwriting and mild redundancy. Some insights are stated twice in adjacent or near-adjacent lines with slightly different language, which could be trimmed. The prose is good enough for top venues but would likely be tightened further by a demanding editor.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level writing is polished, with high information density and a strong ear for cadence; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Metaphors are imaginative and mostly coherent, though the density of figurative language is very high throughout, risking occasional purple-prose saturation. There are no visible loops, scaffolding phrases, or clarity breaks, and syntax varies well. A slight paring back of ornate imagery in peak beats would likely sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but mostly precise: metaphors like “petals unfurled in silent symphonies” and “the flower unfurled like a velvet scream” are striking and coherent. There is minimal redundancy or scaffolding; nearly every sentence earns its place in advancing mood, world, or theme. At times, the figurative load is heavy enough to border on purple, which can slightly blur urgency in the climactic stretch. Still, clarity remains intact and the musicality feels intentional rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every image does double duty for mood and worldbuilding. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and purposeful, and the rhythm modulates well between lush description and clipped emphasis. There’s little to no scaffolding, repetition, or syntactic monotony, and the closure image is sharp and unblurred. The only slight restraint is that the metaphor density occasionally brushes against purple, though it doesn’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym looping. Figurative language around the “learning” wind and “singular convergence” is coherent and purposeful rather than purple. A few phrases repeat ideas (e.g., reiterating his job as “foresight in action”) but not to the point of dragging momentum. The final paragraphs, in particular, are tight and sonically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are often fresh (“silk scarves woven from silence and starlight”), sentences do multiple jobs, and there are few true redundancies. The prose walks the purple-prose edge but mostly stays deliberate; figurative density is high yet patterned and controlled. Repetitions like “sculpted hush,” “certify wonder,” and various “unfetterings” occasionally feel like mild synonym loops rather than necessary intensifications. Those ornamental echoes and the relentless metaphorical pressure keep it shy of the 9-band despite its beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and almost every line advances character, world, or theme without scaffolding or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but purposeful, and most images are fresh and coherent, sustaining a consistent textural fabric. There are no significant loops or mechanical cadences, and the final images (“more instrument, more monument,” “quiet avalanche”) land cleanly. The density of metaphor could be eased by one or two plainer lines in peak beats, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often gorgeous and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, theme, and character (“the slope of a sigh, the integral of a sob, the asymptote of longing”). However, figurative language is present in a high percentage of sentences, especially early, creating a mild sense of saturation that risks purple-ness and occasionally blurs edge clarity. There’s little outright redundancy or syntactic templating; rhythm and sentence shapes vary enough to keep momentum. A touch more restraint—letting a few concrete, unadorned actions stand—would push the line craft into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and structure, imagery is generally precise (“brittle frost that sang with each step,” “eyes like tarnished silver”), and most lines do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without padding. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and pattern-consistent around sound, resonance, and memory. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; momentum is maintained despite a reflective mode. A few aphoristic statements flirt with purple or overt abstraction, but they don’t materially obscure sense or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do double duty in advancing both atmosphere and concept, with few if any true scaffolding or repetition artifacts. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded (“mist curling like breath,” “velvet” time), and causality remains clear even in the most lyrical passages. There is a mild risk of over-saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—which can verge on purple for a highly demanding market and slightly blunts impact. Tightening a few metaphors or allowing more plain lines would likely raise this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character). However, there is some repetition and near-looping (“raveling silence,” “time’s unraveling tapestry,” “stoically sparkling”) and a tendency toward stacked metaphors that risk purple at times. These habits don’t obscure causality or closure, but they slightly blur sharpness in a few beats that would benefit from plainer language. Line-level craft is strong enough for serious consideration but just shy of the extreme precision expected at the most selective venues.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose shows high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, theme, and character at once—and the rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum in a reflective mode. Metaphor and image are generally coherent and apt (“liquid twilight,” “stars tangled in branches”), and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym-churn. That said, the density of figurative language is consistently high, even in beats that might benefit from plainer texture, risking the sense of slight over-luxuriance rather than compression. Line-level craft is strong and clear, but a demanding venue would likely ask for a few trims to let the most powerful images breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative, slightly viscous feel of reality-shifting. There are a few spots where abstraction or stacked modifiers flirt with purple (“truth never announced itself—it whispered, retreated, doubled back”), yet these remain legible and do not obscure action or closure. Momentum holds through the transition and revelation without looped phrasing or structural clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense with images that usually pull double duty for mood and character. Metaphors are frequent but mostly coherent and purposeful, with minimal redundancy or scaffolding. At times the figurative load (“velvet dark,” “luminescent,” “ghost-light”) edges toward purple, which slightly softens the impact at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and imagery is often striking without sacrificing clarity (“laughter ringing like wind chimes forged from lightning”). There is a high density of figurative language, but the metaphors stay coherent and motif-driven (light, reflection, storms) rather than scattershot. Redundancy is minimal; only occasional near-paraphrases (“She would rise again, climb again, laugh again”) serve rhythmic emphasis. The prose is lush but still propulsive enough for this lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, strong verbs, and metaphors that are both clear and thematically resonant (“truth gleamed like wet stone at twilight,” “patience detonates”). There is heavy figurative load—nearly every sentence carries an image—which risks purple prose but largely maintains coherence and momentum. Redundancies are minimal, and sentences often do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or character plus setting). A few formulations (“quiet explosion of insight,” “quietly explosive act”) feel slightly self-conscious or on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blur sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and controlled: most sentences do at least two jobs (image + mood, or action + theme), and there’s little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but generally precise and thematically unified (sorrow as something measurable, moonlight as healing), avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally; the piece reads aloud smoothly with clear propulsion despite its lyricism. A faint tendency toward density in places (“healing brass,” “quantified sorrow”) is still coherent and does not obscure clarity, so it only nudges the piece below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and imaginative, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“light here was memory made visible,” “fireflies pinned behind crystal”). Rhythm and paragraphing generally support momentum, and there are few if any clarity slips. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, and in the final stretch some phrases (e.g., “ancient, necessary truth,” multiple re-statements of swaddling and weaving) feel redundant or a shade purple, slightly dulling impact. A light tightening and occasional plainer sentence for contrast would bring this to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and image-rich, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization; phrases like “time thinning like old parchment” and “moonlight pooled like liquid silver” show strong craft. At times, imagery and abstractions stack a little densely, and the final paragraphs carry a mild redundancy between eloquent action-images and explicit thematic statements. Nonetheless, syntax varies, rhythm is musical without becoming mechanical, and clarity of action is preserved. The piece comes close to purple but mostly maintains control and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density—most sentences do double duty, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. Imagery is generally fresh and precise (“bell above the door that chimed like a temple gong,” “truth hides…in the slow dissolve of what once was obvious”) without slipping into figurative muddle. A few lines verge on over-articulation or near-redundancy around the sacred/absolution motif, but they do not significantly drag momentum or obscure closure. Grammar and sequencing are clean, and the final cadence lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and image-dense—“auroras trapped in glass,” “cadence of hope,” “the most durable frequency of all”—yet usually clear and purposeful, doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym churn. That said, the density of figurative language is high across nearly every line, risking saturation and mildly blurring impact in places where a simpler sentence might hit harder. Under an elite standard, a bit more sparing deployment of metaphor—especially in the middle stretch—would sharpen the strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character at once) without obvious redundancy or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and non-mixed, and the rhythm varies nicely between longer, atmospheric lines and shorter, sharp beats at moments of pressure (“The woman froze. / Not from pain, not from magic—but from memory.”). There are no noticeable loops, filter-verb stacks, or grammatical slips that impede clarity. The only arguable risk is richness bordering on purple in places, but it remains purposeful and legible, especially at the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is rich and image-dense, with strong rhythm and generally high information density—most lines do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Sentences vary in length and structure, and there are no major clarity lapses or confusing metaphors; the scene is easy to follow. There is some flirtation with purple diction and conceptual redundancy (e.g., repeating “terrestrially cosmic,” multiple aurora-heartbeat echoes), which mildly slows momentum in a short piece. Tightening a few of those lyric flourishes would sharpen impact without sacrificing style.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) and the rhythm varies nicely between long, lush lines and shorter pivots. Figurative language is often striking (“It fits her fingers like a bone,” tears sizzling on crystal) and generally coherent. There is some density/purple risk—stacks of metaphors about sorrow, calls, songs, imprisonment—that could be pruned for even sharper impact. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is strong line by line, with high information density—most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise and internally consistent (e.g., the sky as a bruise, echoes clinging like pollen), avoiding mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping; momentum rarely stalls despite the lyric texture. At this length and ambition, the piece reads polished enough for publication with only very light tightening, not structural line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are generally lean for lyrical prose, with high information density and a good balance between figurative and concrete detail. Recurrent metaphors (color of wonder, breath-like cycles) form a coherent pattern rather than a jumble, and there’s little obvious redundancy or scaffolding. A few lines flirt with purple (“children who’d never learned to fear falling,” “truth too old to shout”), but they remain legible and thematically on-point. Rhythm and paragraphing carry momentum smoothly for an accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with high information density, and the rhythmic variation keeps the piece from sagging despite lush description. Imagery is fresh and coherent (desert roses of bioglass, fears as “folded fractals of terror,” magnetic north as a “deep, planetary sigh”) and avoids mixed metaphors. There is some repetition of concepts (static, transformation) but it reads as deliberate motif rather than scaffold or synonym churn. No obvious grammatical or sequencing issues interfere with clarity at the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with images like the envelope “fluttering… like a trapped wing” doing double duty for mood and theme. There’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping; each beat tends to move situation or charge rather than rephrase. Some phrases verge on the programmatic (“curated catharsis”) or slightly purple, but they don’t obstruct clarity or pacing. Rhythm tracks the quiet escalation well, allowing the climax to breathe without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense yet generally precise, and most metaphors (web, sonar, hymns, veil) cohere around a tight image system. Information is carried efficiently—almost every sentence advances atmosphere, world, or thematic stakes—and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The prose occasionally skirts purple (“static hymns,” “emotional coordinates”) and stacks figurative language, which may slightly blur immediacy in high-pressure moments. Nonetheless, clarity at closure remains intact and rhythm on the page is carefully modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence-level craft is high: images are precise (“ribs arching like cathedral buttresses,” “footsteps skip like stones across water”) and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and theme at once). Figurative density is elevated but controlled; metaphors stay within a coherent field of sea, gravity, sediment, and light without mixing incoherently. There’s little redundancy or scaffold, and the prose maintains momentum even in descriptive passages. A slight risk of overload in stacked imagery keeps it just shy of flawless, but readability and closure clarity remain excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: high information density, few redundancies, and metaphors that generally cohere and enrich rather than confuse. The prose sustains a lyrical mode without obvious template cadences or paraphrase loops, and key beats (placing the wing, the whisper, the ascent) are dramatized rather than summarized. There is some risk of purple density in stacked figurative phrases, but clarity at closure never suffers. Syntax variation and paragraphing support a smooth, contemplative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for character, setting, and theme. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent, and there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy; almost every line earns its place. The prose is rich enough that, in places, it nearly tips into ornamental, with figurative language packed densely across calm beats. That lushness is controlled enough not to blur clarity, but the density keeps this shy of absolute top-tier minimality and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and many metaphors that carry real work (“tragically radiant” memories as supernovas, for instance). The prose maintains momentum despite being heavily figurative, and there are few, if any, true clarity lapses. That said, the density of imagery edges toward overwrought in places, and some near-redundant intensifiers could be trimmed without loss (“not a plea, not a prayer, but a vow” alongside other similar triads). The slight saturation of lyricism is the main factor holding this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are syntactically clean, often doing double duty for atmosphere and action, and the core images (ink resisting, scroll exhaling, marble sighing open) are vivid. However, figurative density is high almost everywhere, with adjectives and metaphors stacked (“pearl twilight — soft lavenders, muted golds, the color of mercy…”) that occasionally tip toward purple and could be pruned for impact. There’s some conceptual redundancy around key motifs (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring,” the drought’s moral calculus). Despite that, clarity and momentum are not compromised, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images (“webs of intrigue,” “shrunk to a sigh curled in the roots of a petrified willow”) and a good sense of rhythm. However, figurative density is high and occasionally veers into purple or meta (“through progressive disclosure—each revelation earned by silence”), with some concept-reiterating lines that don’t add new pressure. Despite this, clarity remains intact, and most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding + theme + mood). Tighter pruning of abstractions and a few slightly redundant explanatory sentences would lift this closer to elite line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: dense but mostly clean imagery, minimal redundancy, and sentences that usually carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without sagging. Metaphoric language is frequent yet coherent, staying within the ice/sea/light/dream palette and avoiding mixed vehicles that would blur sense. There’s a slight flirtation with purple in a few stacked modifiers, but it doesn’t materially slow the piece or obscure cause/effect. Overall, the prose passes a high bar for rhythm, precision, and economy at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, character, theme) with good rhythmic variation, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is rich and generally coherent (“starlight caught in a spider’s thread”), supporting the mood without often collapsing into muddle. A few constructions (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity humming in her veins”) verge on ornate and could be pared back for even greater impact. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, with high information density: most sentences carry worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once without obvious scaffolding. Imagery is strong and mostly controlled; while there is frequent figurative language, it serves a coherent tonal palette rather than sliding into mixed metaphors or purple excess. Repetitions around “truth,” “stillpoint,” and “digging” verge on thematic hammering but don’t seriously drag momentum. Line-level clarity is maintained through the climax and final images, with no major loops or artifacts blunting the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have varied rhythm, high information density, and very few redundancies or scaffolding phrases; imagery is mostly precise and evocative. There is a heavy layer of metaphor and adjective, but it rarely slips into incoherence or mixed vehicles, and the prose remains legible under pressure. A few lines verge on purple or over-explanatory (e.g., reasserting that the messages are “lyrically prophetic” and then explaining what that means), which slightly blunts momentum. Still, this is well above standard submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is rich, carefully constructed, and mostly efficient; many sentences do double duty for setting and theme. There is a high density of figurative language, but the metaphors are generally clean and consistent with the sound/memory motif. Some repetition (“gleaned,” “sweetened silence,” the cadence of certain clauses) borders on ornamental rather than additive, and a few lines verge on purple. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image reads crisply rather than being smothered by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, imagery is often striking (“a basin of liquid mercury,” “gentle as a mother’s lullaby, fierce as a glacier’s birth”), and most lines do double duty for mood and plot. There is some density of figurative language that approaches purple, and a few phrases repeat conceptually (“through vibrational matching,” “logically emotional”) without adding new pressure. Still, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, with little true scaffold or redundancy. The closing image lands cleanly despite the lyric intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and almost all carry atmosphere, theme, or forward motion. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and on-theme, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy that feels like filler. However, the density of metaphor and repeated constructions risks slight purple-prose and thematic reiteration, which can flatten momentum in a few spots. It’s polished and publishable with only light tightening of repeated thesis-like turns.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level work is polished: high information density, minimal scaffolding, and vivid metaphors that mostly cohere (“data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma” neatly encapsulates the piece). Sentences do multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and theme—without feeling bloated, and there’s no significant synonym churn or structural looping. A few slogans (“doors left shut fester”) and parallel moral phrases risk slight overstatement, but they don’t materially slow momentum or muddy the closure image. Rhythmically and syntactically, the piece reads clean and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid yet controlled, and most sentences carry more than one layer of work (character, atmosphere, and theme). Rhythm is varied, with well-placed shorter lines (“He froze.” “The heart was the final challenge.”) punctuating longer, more ornate sentences. There is some lushness and repetition, but it feels rhetorical and intentional rather than like scaffolding or synonym churn. No figurative muddle or structural artifacts impede clarity or undercut the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is dense but largely efficient, with most metaphors earning their keep and doing multiple jobs (world-building, tone, and theme at once). There’s a mild risk of overload—many figurative phrases per paragraph—but they stay coherent and rarely feel redundant or like synonym churn. Rhythm varies well, with short emphatic sentences (“The Engine whirred louder. / Gears reversed.”) punctuating longer, ornate ones to keep momentum. A slight trim of nonessential modifiers would sharpen impact further but is not required for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally sharp, economical, and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“The archive wasn’t just a record—it was a resonance chamber.”). Repetition is mostly purposeful for rhythm and emphasis rather than scaffolding, and there are few, if any, genuine loops or slack lines. Some stretches lean toward purple or over-dense metaphor, but clarity and momentum are preserved; we always understand what’s happening and why it matters. Slight syntactic variety around repeated “She [verb]” openings would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and musical, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere, theme, and character. Repetition (“It was slow work. / The ice shifted. / The lighthouse beam swept.”) is rhythmic and purposeful rather than scaffold. At times the language flirts with purple via stacked modifiers and abstractions, but clarity of image and causality remains intact. Trimming a few conceptual phrases would sharpen an already strong line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, character) with little scaffolding or redundancy, and metaphors are mostly clean and reinforcing rather than conflicting. The prose has a flexible rhythm, and there are no significant clarity glitches or loops, even in dense descriptive passages. Figurative density is high, but it is largely purposeful and pattern-consistent, supporting the accumulative/textural drive. A few phrases (“purest acoustics of finitude,” “windborne solace in every breath”) verge on purple and could be pared back for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images (amber pavilion as lantern, leaves skittering like secrets, grapes purpled by frost). Sentences vary in rhythm, and most lines do double duty for mood and theme. There is some tendency toward purple or redundant thematizing (multiple explicit restatements of mismatch/understanding) that could be trimmed for greater sharpness and momentum. Still, clarity remains high and no figurative muddles or serious loops blunt the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush, with high information density and many lines doing double duty for setting and theme (“as if honesty required asymmetry” marries world detail to concept). Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep momentum in a fundamentally static scene. That said, figurative language is near-constant, and a few images (“architecture of silence,” “whisperfield calm”) edge toward self-consciousness, risking slight saturation. Tightening one or two metaphor clusters would sharpen impact without sacrificing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are musical, imagery is often striking (“bees hummed hymns to resilience”), and information density is high without major scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and pattern-consistent, leaning into the arc and decay/growth motifs rather than scattering mixed metaphors. Some phrases veer close to purple or redundant thesis (“whimsy wrapped in earnestness was the truest magic,” after we’ve already seen that dynamic dramatized), but they don’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with varied sentence lengths supporting a gentle but steady propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: rich imagery (“pooled like ink,” “origami made of breath”) carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and theme—without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is dense but generally coherent and thematically aligned with sound, text, and decay; it rarely tips into muddle or cliché. Sentences and paragraphs vary in length to create a pleasing rhythm that supports the contemplative pace. The high metaphor density might be pared very slightly for some markets, but it does not materially obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and images that frequently do double duty (e.g., videotapes as both setting and tombstones of abandoned time). Line-level clarity remains high despite dense figurative language, and there’s little to no scaffolding or synonym looping. However, figurative density is extreme in places—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile—which edges toward purple and could be slightly pared without loss. That lushness counts as mild overwriting under this rubric, warranting a modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies to suit the pressure. Imagery is often striking (“storm-tossed milk,” “miniature moons around her face”), and causality within sentences remains clear despite lyric density. There is a high concentration of figurative language and abstractions in places, edging toward purple but not tipping into muddle or loops. Minor repetition of certain phrases and intensifiers keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are vivid, multi-sensory, and often do double duty for theme and atmosphere (“like dew to spiderwebs at dawn” is a standout). The prose sustains a high density of figurative language without collapsing into muddle, and there’s good rhythmic variation. However, some metaphors and echoing constructions (“scent of hope” elaborations, repeated triads of comparisons) verge on excess and could be tightened for even sharper impact. There’s little true scaffolding, but occasional over-richness slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich, image-dense, and mostly avoids purple excess; metaphors (“burned, not with heat but with recursion”) are inventive yet coherent with the world rules. Sentences generally do double duty, advancing both concept and atmosphere, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym-churn. Some structural repetition (“She [verb]. / She [verb].”) is noticeable but rhythmic rather than clumsy, and explanatory lines about physics seams are the main minor flattening. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready and carries the conceptual weight without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, often multi-functional, and the imagery is vivid without devolving into confusion; momentum holds through an essentially static physical scene. Some metaphors and abstractions cluster (“turn mistakes into constellations,” “quiet architecture of redemption,” “old grammar of repair”), nudging toward purple but remaining coherent and voice-justified. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; most lines earn their place. The density of figurative language occasionally risks softening impact, preventing this from reaching the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often do double duty (worldbuilding plus emotion), and most metaphors are coherent and mutually reinforcing (erosion, tide, polishing, constellations). There is some density and repetition (“reflectively vibrant” twice, multiple “mist thickened” / “mist curled” moments) that nudges toward purple but does not obscure sense or momentum. The pacing of clauses generally mirrors the contemplative pressure of the scene, and there’s little true scaffolding or synonym churn. Overall clarity and propulsion are maintained despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have rhythmic variety, high information density, and frequently do double duty in setting and emotion. Imagery is vivid and largely coherent, particularly in linking circuitry and roots, heat and hum, amber and dusk. That said, figurative language is almost constant, edging toward purple and occasionally feeling layered for its own sake rather than for additional pressure or clarity. A few small artifacts and redundancies slightly dull momentum in what is already a low-conflict piece.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is highly polished: most sentences do multiple jobs, imagery is often striking, and momentum rarely stalls despite the reflective mode. However, figurative density is consistently very high (“time pooled in eddies of forgotten breath,” “rain that tasted of ink and salt,” “gulls crying like editors”) and occasionally approaches purple, risking saturation. There are few if any scaffolding or paraphrase loops, and closure remains crisp and legible. A touch more restraint in metaphor in a couple of mid-paragraph stretches would elevate this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing mood, world, and theme) with minimal scaffolding, and figurative language is vivid yet controlled (“arbor hummed—not with insects, but with memory”). There are no meaningful loops or synonym churn; the prose maintains momentum despite its lushness. A few metaphors flirt with density (“spun golden stories with each note”) but they stay coherent within the established lyrical mode and don’t obscure action or stakes. The final paragraph in particular lands cleanly, reusing earlier diction (“gathering hush”) to reweight the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is lush and mostly controlled, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. Some figurative stacking (“thick as velvet,” “memory through scar tissue,” “steamed like tiny hearths”) risks veering toward purple, and the metaphoric frequency is high across the whole piece. However, images rarely contradict or confuse, and rhythm is modulated enough that momentum doesn’t stall. Minor repetition and ornament keep this just shy of the very top tier, but the craft remains strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: high information density, few if any redundancies, and metaphors that are usually precise and apt (“geological patience,” “angles as his syntax”). The prose occasionally flirts with over-richness—figurative language is nearly continuous—but the images interlock thematically and rarely feel gratuitous. Rhythm reads well aloud, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraphing that maintains momentum in a reflective piece. Any hint of purple is minor and does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, with many images doing double duty for mood and theme (“eggshell holding moonlight,” “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and most lines carry real information or emotional charge rather than filler. However, metaphor density is very high; a few stacked images (e.g., multiple comparisons in quick succession) flirt with purple prose and mildly dilute impact. Tightening a handful of over-ornate spots would increase clarity and propulsion without sacrificing the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded (“like amber holding a wing, or frost capturing a leaf’s vein”). Rhythm varies naturally, and the piece reads smoothly aloud. The density of figurative language occasionally approaches the ornate, and a few abstractions (“motivation,” “lesson”) blunt the otherwise sharp imagery. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact, and no metaphoric muddle harms the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most metaphors coherent and multi-tasking for setting, mood, and theme (“like breath caught mid-sigh”; “a flash — weak, sputtering — bursts like a dying star”). There’s minimal redundancy and no significant scaffolding or synonym loops; nearly every sentence adds new texture or advances the emotional arc. The lyric intensity occasionally skirts the edge of overrich, but it remains legible and propulsive, especially as the story moves into the spire and the envelope reveal. Line-level craft is easily at a competitive-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line, the prose is polished and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for character and world-building. Metaphors are generally apt and grounded in the story’s material vocabulary (light, structure, entropy, flow). There is some tendency toward stacked lyricism and repeated structures (triadic lists like “redirected, repurposed, resilient”), but it doesn’t significantly blur sense or stall momentum. Overall the language would sit comfortably in a strong literary magazine with minimal trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: sentences do multi-work (world, emotion, theme) and the read-aloud rhythm modulates well between long, lush lines and shorter emphatic beats. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and on-theme, and there’s little true scaffolding or repetition that doesn’t carry new nuance. A few spots verge on purple or redundant (“petrichor nostalgia,” “liquid sun,” “time pooled like mercury”), which may lightly drag momentum for some elite markets. Overall, the prose maintains clarity and propulsion despite its ornamental style.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, sonically attentive, and information-dense; most sentences do double work in advancing atmosphere and concept (“stained-glass windows filtering harsh light into bearable hues”). Rhythm varies well, and there’s little scaffolding or synonym churn; images are mostly coherent and thematically aligned. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition in the architecture-of-lies extended metaphor, which edges toward telling rather than letting earlier images stand. Those moments slightly blunt momentum but don’t obscure clarity or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple functions (image, theme, character) and the prose reads smoothly aloud. Metaphors like “the sky’s broken tooth” and “sleeping serpent of wisdom” are vivid and coherent, and repetition patterns (fog, hush, hands) feel intentional rather than accidental. There is some density of figurative language that edges toward purple in places, but it doesn’t obscure meaning or stall momentum. Scaffold or synonym loops are minimal, and syntax is varied and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple loads (image, theme, character) and the prose is largely clear despite its density. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (cartography, textiles, weather, sea); there are few, if any, mixed or clashing metaphors. However, nearly every line reaches for a metaphor or elevated turn of phrase, which risks purple over-saturation and slightly blurs propulsion. Tightening a handful of more ornate constructions would sharpen impact and rhythm for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: images are vivid, information-dense, and usually do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme at once). There is some risk of purple prose—metaphors are frequent and occasionally verge on excess, but they remain coherent and don’t materially obscure action or closure. Momentum holds; sentences almost always move character, setting, or stakes forward, with minimal scaffolding or repetition. The density is high enough that a few lines feel ornamental rather than essential, preventing an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished, dense, and mostly purposeful: images often do double duty for character and theme, and there is little scaffolding or redundancy. The figurative language is rich but coherent, with obsidian, kelp, and song forming a tight motif rather than a mixed-grab bag. At times the diction edges toward purple and explanatory (“the frequency of her unyielding compassion”), which slightly blunts momentum and subtlety. Still, clarity and propulsion remain intact, and the final paragraphs land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, character, theme) with relatively little scaffolding, and metaphor density is high but mostly disciplined and coherent (“like trapped auroras,” “as if the heavens themselves had pressed mute”). There are few, if any, paraphrase loops or filler sentences; rhythm and syntax feel intentionally varied and read smoothly aloud. The prose occasionally approaches purple, but images remain legible and grounded, and none of the figurative work muddies the closure image of the first drop. Overall momentum is preserved despite the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, imagery is rich, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once). There is some repetition in motif and structure (“petals,” “light without fire”) that occasionally borders on over-insistence but generally reads as intentional patterning. Figurative language is dense but not incoherent; metaphors stay within a clear cosmological register. Momentum holds for a lyric piece, though the absence of harder turns means the prose sometimes carries more weight than the story’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, character) and the metaphors are generally coherent and apt (“wings brushing the panes like parchment against stone”). The prose sustains a high figurative density without major muddle, and sequencing is clear; there are no real scaffold loops or mechanical templates. That said, nearly every line reaches for an image, which approaches purple in aggregate and slightly flattens dynamics—there are few plainer, cutting lines to offset the lushness. This density trims headroom in an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (world, character, theme) without obvious redundancy, and most figurative language is precise and thematically tied (time as cathedral, ridge as altar, tide polishing the handle into an altar). The repetition of structural phrases (“not in stone but in bone,” “he did not wind. / He did not adjust.”) is controlled and impactful rather than mechanical. That said, the prose sometimes skirts purple—metaphors stacked densely (“brine and memory,” “heavier than guilt, smoother than forgiveness”) risk saturation and could be trimmed for even more power. Clarity is never lost, but a touch more austerity would raise the piece into a leaner, more cutting register.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, and very little scaffolding or redundancy. Rhythm varies well between longer, lush descriptions and shorter, declarative turns (“This was why she’d come. / To untangle.”), which gives the piece momentum despite its lyric mode. There is some risk of purple excess—metaphor upon metaphor in a few lines—though most images hold together and do not contradict or confuse. Tightening one or two spots where figurative language stacks without adding new precision would strengthen clarity further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with few if any syntactic slips, and most metaphors are coherent and multi-functional. Several sentences pack dense information and imagery without collapsing into sludge, and there’s minimal paraphrase looping. The figurative load is high, bordering on purple in places, which can slightly blunt momentum in a short piece meant to carry an arc. Still, clarity survives throughout and the final lines (“The final glyph — ‘Begin.’ … the earth itself had exhaled”) land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and images that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, character) at once. Figurative language is frequent but coherent; metaphors around dust, music, and heat form a stable cluster rather than a muddled mix. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there’s little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping—nearly every sentence adds or sharpens something. The only restraint is that the density of imagery occasionally borders on saturation, which might slightly blunt impact for a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often beautiful and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. However, figurative language is very frequent, and a few images verge on purple or redundant (e.g., multiple “breathing”/“whispering”/“exhaling” personifications of the gallery and chair). Momentum is mostly preserved, but occasional stacking of metaphors and abstractions (“emotions too fragile to survive daylight,” “static of memory”) could be pared without loss. Line-level craft is strong overall but could benefit from a touch more austerity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and characterization, and the metaphors are coherent and apt to the world (erosion, tides, sediment, gears). There’s minimal redundancy and no serious scaffold or template cadence; the prose sustains momentum despite its density. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur meaning or rhythm. A slight tendency toward uniformly lush phrasing in non-peak beats keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmically pleasing, and information-dense, with very few wasted words or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is often beautiful (“dust motes suspended like forgotten notes,” “traveled stillness”) and thematically integrated. That said, the prose leans toward the lush and abstract in places, stacking metaphors and conceptual phrasing in a way that edges close to purple and could be tightened for even greater impact. The density doesn’t quite impede clarity or closure, but a slightly leaner line would be expected at top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often do double duty for image and theme, and most metaphors (“leaves unfolding like scrolls,” “its weight like a promise”) are clean and apt. There is some density of figurative language and a tendency to restate concepts (ruin→beauty, gentle rebellion) that could be tightened for even more impact. Momentum holds despite the lyric emphasis, with few true scaffolding sentences. Minor overrichness and occasional near-redundancy keep it below the top band but still well above average.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus mood, or character plus theme). Figurative language is frequent but generally apt, and it rarely clots the sense—images like “truth spilled out of him like sap from a tapped maple” are both specific and character-attuned. There’s minimal redundancy and no obvious scaffolding or loops. A few phrases flirt with purple (“nectar dusk,” “mapping ghosts”) but they don’t materially harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with most images doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and harmonious; there are few, if any, mixed metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and syntax supports a smooth read. The density of imagery flirts with purple prose in places, which slightly blunts impact but doesn’t seriously hinder clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are often striking and economical, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without losing clarity. There is some purple density—figurative language in many consecutive sentences and a few slogans (e.g., “We chose fluidity over fortress. Mystery over monument.”) that feel more like crafted epigraphs than lived perception. Nonetheless, momentum holds, syntax is varied, and the closure image is clean and memorable. Trimming 5–10% of the most declarative or slogan-like lines would make it publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is dense but largely precise; most metaphors are coherent and conceptually apt (“spiraled without curvature,” “mirage painted on the inside of a sphere”). Sentences do multiple jobs—character, world, and theme—without much padding, and there’s minimal paraphrase looping. Rhythm is well modulated, with short, blunt lines (“He’d tried resting.”) puncturing longer ones for effect. A few images verge on over-stacked abstraction, which slightly risks saturation but doesn’t materially obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are sharp (“pooled like spilled ink,” “silvered by decades of lunar exposure”), sentences carry multiple functions, and there’s little redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative density is high but usually coherent and on-theme, so the prose feels lush rather than merely purple. There are a few spots where stacked abstractions and modifiers edge toward overrichness (“smog-throttled and weary,” “saffron quiet”), slightly dulling impact through uniform intensity. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact throughout, and the final cadence is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense but controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character all at once. Metaphors are generally fresh and apt (e.g., “echoes remembered songs better than the people did”), and repetition such as the Friday bread motif works as intentional pattern, not loop. There is a mild risk of tonal over-saturation—so many rich images that some could be pruned for maximum impact—but clarity and momentum remain intact. Line-level craft would require only very light tightening for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and motion) and rhythm varies effectively. Some metaphoric density (“unraveling of fate’s cruel arithmetic,” “blooming” stone, “world’s weary bones”) edges toward purple but remains coherent and legible. There is light repetition of certain constructions and intensifiers, yet not to the point of true loop/scaffold or opacity. The climax and final image are clear and unharmed by any prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically controlled, and densely informative, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and psychology. Metaphors are often striking and apt (“like grease on glass,” “melting into the funhouse floor like sugar in rain”), and scaffolding or repetition is minimal. There is some tendency toward metaphor stacking and purple density, which occasionally risks saturation but doesn’t significantly obscure sense or dull the ending image. Minor trimming could heighten impact, but current execution is still publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is highly polished: sentences are information-dense and multitasking, imagery is inventive yet usually coherent, and there is very little scaffolding or repetition. The rhythm modulates well—long, sinuous lines for atmosphere, sharper beats around key actions (“He dropped to his knees, pressed his palm…”). Figurative language is heavy but patterned and voice-motivated rather than random purple prose; individual metaphors (“sea’s mirrored skin,” “harmonic rain”) mostly hold logically. A slight risk of overload remains, but it doesn’t obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is dense, purposeful, and largely free of scaffold or paraphrase loops; images like “spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs” carry both atmosphere and character psychology. Rhythm varies naturally, and most sentences multitask—worldbuilding, emotion, and theme often share the same line. While the piece leans heavily into figurative language, it avoids mixed metaphors or opaque flourish, and clarity at the closure beat is never in doubt. A touch more pruning in a few heavily adjectival stretches could tighten momentum, but the craft is well above average and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: images are vivid (“roots cracking through the platform’s concrete like veins of forgotten time”), sentences carry multiple functions at once, and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. The prose balances lyricism with clarity, and the final paragraphs land with a clean rhythmic cadence. At times the density of figurative language and abstractions (myth, memory, noble lies, foundations) edges toward purple or over-expository, especially in the middle where argument dominates scene. Still, momentum and clarity never truly suffer, keeping this comfortably in the strong-to-very-strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often perform multiple functions (image, theme, character) and momentum is maintained despite a reflective, ritualistic cadence. Figurative language is rich and mostly coherent (“chandeliers now crusted barnacle-crowns,” “dates from mold-eaten invitations”) and there are no major syntactic or logical slips. That said, nearly every sentence carries metaphor or ornament, which risks saturation and occasionally blurs edge and impact; a touch more spareness around peak beats could heighten contrast. There are no meaningful loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the final lines land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is strong: sentences are clear, grammatically clean, and often carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious scaffolding. Metaphors like “time here had pooled, not passed” and “to give the silenced a syntax” are striking and apt, and repetition of certain phrases (“not… but…”) reads intentional rather than sloppy. There is mild overrichness—stacked modifiers and conceptual restatements—especially in the thematic closing stretch, but they don’t seriously bog momentum or blur sense. Overall, information density and rhythm would meet a high bar with only light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and largely clean, evocative syntax; many sentences do double or triple duty for world, theme, and emotion. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, which edges toward over-saturation and occasionally blurs rather than sharpens tension. There are no glaring mixed metaphors or loops, but the relentless imagery slightly dampens momentum in what should be peak-pressure beats. Tightening a few ornamented lines would elevate this to elite-mag caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is generally tight, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme at once) and a clear rhythmic sense. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and thematically relevant (e.g., “oil on water,” “wound turning in its sleep”), avoiding major mixed-metaphor muddle. There are a few near-repetitions (“intangibly tangible,” geode pulsing/throbbing) that brush purple but don’t obstruct clarity or momentum. The prose sustains density without obvious scaffolding or loops, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, most lines carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, character, theme), and there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and on-theme, with only occasional phrases verging on purple without breaking clarity. The prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism, especially around the discovery and activation beats. A touch more sparing use of abstraction in the final third would push this closer to elite-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-by-line, the prose is controlled, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences do double duty in advancing image and emotion. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned, with little in the way of mixed or strained metaphors. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and key beats (the memory, the vomiting, the dissolution of carvings) are dramatized rather than summarized. The main limitation is occasional over-explanation and slightly purple turns in the closing stretch, which very mildly slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“even the smallest hinge can open the heaviest door—if you turn it with patience”). Information density is high and there’s little true scaffolding or redundant looping. The main weakness is a tendency toward stacked abstraction and aphorism, which sometimes blurs immediacy and borders on purple (“synchronized her breaths with the rhythm of the moon phases”) rather than sharpening concrete experience. Despite that, clarity remains intact and the final image is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence rhythm, good information density, and multiple images doing double duty for character and theme (e.g., hair as “unresolved equations”). There is some risk of figurative overload—metaphor stacks like “backlash of regrets,” “bruised twilight,” “merrily melancholic” cluster and could feel slightly purple in aggregate. A few thematic sentences paraphrase what images already show, introducing mild redundancy. Still, clarity and momentum survive the lyric density, and the final paragraphs land cleanly and musically.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, interiority) with minimal scaffolding, and rhythm varies well between longer lyric lines and shorter emphatic beats. Figurative language is frequent but mostly precise and thematically coherent (bones stained by a forgotten past, scars as subway routes, ripples as unlived paths). There are moments verging on purple (“delicately robust,” “fiercely alive in the dark”), but they remain intelligible and do not obscure action or closure. No significant loops, redundancies, or syntactic monotony are evident at pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have musical variation, images are often fresh, and many lines do double duty for mood and meaning (“her skin tingled, not with pain, but with translation”). Repetition of certain structures (“Not X, but Y”) and high metaphor density skirt purple prose but mostly read as deliberate patterning rather than artifact. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the rhythm supports the accumulative ritual feel. A touch more spareness in a few thematic statements would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is dense and imaginative, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion; there are few if any true scaffolding or redundant lines. However, figurative language is packed into nearly every sentence, pushing toward purple at times and modestly risking reader fatigue. Despite that density, clarity of action and stakes is preserved, and the closure image (saucer whole, descent to the child) lands cleanly. With slightly more variation between plain and ornate lines, this could rise into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is vivid, dense, and generally efficient; most sentences do double duty in world-building and emotional development. Metaphor usage is frequent but controlled; images like “a lullaby made of rust and solar wind” and “thread spun from her own exhaled breaths” feel coherent with the story’s fabric and don’t muddle clarity. There’s a mild tendency toward abstraction and concept-stacking in a few places (“emotional gravity,” “precise emotional resonance, measured in grams of levity per heartbeat”), but it remains legible and doesn’t stall momentum. No significant loops, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony undercut the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: images like “time like taffy,” “mist that curled around her ankles like loyal cats,” and the non-glowing bug dissolving “like sugar in warm tea” are vivid yet legible. Most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. The density of figurative language is high, bordering on lush, but patterns are coherent and rarely feel mixed or overwrought; momentum generally holds. Minor risk of purple (“whispering hush,” “a waltz of stars and moons”) doesn’t significantly obscure sense or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and largely free of redundancy or scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., “smiled, not with teeth, but with the winking hush…”) is generally apt and consistent with the tone, without devolving into mixed metaphors. There is some risk of over-lyricism, but it doesn’t obscure causality or muddle the closure image. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout, supporting momentum in a mostly contemplative, procedural scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are dense and multi-functional, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and motivated (aurora as scripture, frictionless reality as “polished to glass”), and information flows clearly despite high lyric density. The rhythm supports the gradual intensification toward the eel contact and pattern revelation. A few phrases (“harvested from a meteor shower that fell silent…”) push toward purple, but they don’t materially obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often carry multiple functions (image, theme, and interior state) without obvious scaffolding, and there are few if any true paraphrase loops. The metaphoric web is largely coherent (cartography, scars, storm, ink, sky) and rarely slips into mixed or contradictory imagery. There is some overwriting—highly figurative diction in many consecutive sentences—which slightly dulls impact in places. Nonetheless, clarity, momentum, and the final image all survive intact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense, and mostly do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, tone, character) without obvious scaffolding or loop. Figurative language is frequent yet coherent, with recurring motifs (light, shadow, music, machinery) rather than mixed metaphors. A few phrases verge on purple (“diplomatically fierce,” “fugue of logic and longing”), but they remain legible and on-tone, not obscuring action or stakes. Tightening a handful of highly ornamented lines could increase momentum, but current execution is clearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and images that often do double duty for mood and theme; there’s very little scaffolding or redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies nicely, and the final passages (“turned decay into a kind of cathedral,” “moonlight stitching the fractures”) land with clear, memorable cadence. However, figurative language is quite frequent and occasionally leans toward over-saturation, risking a slightly uniform lushness in places. Still, clarity and momentum are preserved, and the closure image remains sharp rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, and motion) with very few redundancies, and rhythm varies well. Metaphoric density is high but mostly precise and thematically apt (music-as-physics, compasses aligned to emotions, horizon “inviting night”). A few phrases skirt purple (“longing tempered to steel,” “bureaucrat of causality”) yet do not materially obscure action or cost. Overall propulsion is excellent, with no significant scaffolding or loop artifacts dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, character) and the rhythm supports the accumulative build toward activation and aftermath. Figurative language is rich yet mostly coherent (“petals that shimmered like liquid opal,” “star-drunk skies”), and repetition of key terms (memory, dream, monsoon) feels thematic rather than redundant. There are occasional brushes with purple diction and conceptual density that slightly slow momentum in a short piece. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, with no serious scaffolding, loops, or mixed metaphors dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in world-building and thematics, and there are few true scaffolding or redundant lines. Metaphors are generally apt and sensorial, and the rhythm on the page reads cleanly aloud. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially in the midsection, flirting with over-saturation and occasionally blurring rather than sharpening emotional pressure. Tightening a handful of ornamental metaphors would give the strongest ones more room to land.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished and dense ("drowned soil," "creak like a ship hull"), though the "Poetry... physics" line reads as a platitude. The line-level craft is competent but hamstrung by the summary structure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.5)
    A severe template cadence issue dominates the prose: the rhetorical construction "Not X, but Y" (or "No X. Y") is used over a dozen times. This repetitive syntax creates a droning, didactic rhythm that stalls narrative momentum and reads like a manifesto rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished and evocative ("noise had become impossible"), but suffers from overwriting and telling-summary, particularly the list-like abstraction at the climax ("Love. Loss. Longing. Laughter..."). The reliance on "not X, but Y" constructions to define the concept becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    A pervasive syntactic tic ("Not [X], but [Y]") appears over ten times, creating a repetitive, lecturing cadence that stalls momentum. This template structure dominates the prose at the expense of variety.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery. However, it leans toward adjectival density and sentimental phrasing ("stubborn hope," "mute gleam," "solemn care") that occasionally slows momentum and tells the reader how to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is heavily marred by a pervasive template cadence: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears at least eleven times in a short text (e.g., "not nostalgia, nor penance," "not myth, not metaphor," "not shattered, but unfurled"). This creates a droning, repetitive rhythm that obscures the imagery and severely hampers publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is evocative and dense but occasionally slips into "purple" territory or strained metaphors. Phrases like "rewriting gravity into a question mark" sacrifice clarity for poetic effect, and "liquid seconds" borders on cliché. The high density generally works, but these artifacts distract from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text leans into "purple" description ("staggering grace," "dignity of a falling monarch") that can feel overwrought. The repetition of "staggering grace" at start and end feels like an unpolished echo rather than a resonant refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with mixed ontological lists like "soot and memory-dust." Some rhythmic artifacts appear in the discovery beat ("She froze. That was it."), which feels slightly generic against the otherwise unique imagery. The sensory details are generally vivid and support the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("moved like a sigh," "spilled ink," "humming with stolen luminescence") that prioritizes decoration over precision. There is a tendency to tell emotions and meanings directly ("luminous disbelief") rather than showing them through concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is competent but overwritten, relying on abstract nouns and "purple" phrasing ("fossilized prayer," "dusk bled"). The prompt phrase "thoughtfully spirited" is inserted awkwardly as a modifier twice, disrupting the rhythm, and the reliance on filter verbs ("she knew," "she announced") flattens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.3)
    Significant overwriting and metaphor abuse ("dissolved like sugar in rain," "knees cracking like dry kindling") clutter the prose and slow momentum. The density of figurative language in a high-stakes moment distracts from the action, and the reliance on clichés ("velvet-wrapped poison") detracts from the intended literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from severe simile density, with "like [noun]" constructions cluttering nearly every paragraph ("like a grieving tide," "like moth wings," "like battering rams"). This template cadence stalls momentum and violates the standard for invisible craft.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe template-cadence artifact pervades the text: the construction "not X, but Y" (or variations like "didn't X, it Y") appears over a dozen times. This repetitive scaffolding dominates the prose rhythm and distracts significantly from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    A glaring grammatical error ("spent months eavesdrop") and tautological phrasing ("ambiguously clear clarity") undermine the prose. The writing is often overwrought, with purple descriptions ("vibrated in the marrow") that distract from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Imagery is generally strong, though some metaphors border on mixed or overwrought ("heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness"). The sentence-level craft effectively supports the slow, deliberate pacing of the protagonist's ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level quality is marred by clumsy phrasing (e.g., "peeled, like layers of an onion peeled through holographic principles") and the triple repetition of "mechanically warm," which reads like a prompt-insertion artifact. The final "steam curling... like a question mark" is a cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is fluid but overwritten, heavily reliant on adjective-noun pairings and metaphors that sometimes clutter the image ("black mouth swallowing moonlight"). Phrasing like "She believed—no, she knew" is a stock construction. The "precisely 37 degrees" detail is ambiguous (angle vs. temperature) and feels ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is fluid but suffers from a high density of explanatory similes ("sharp as regret," "silence was a glacier"). These metaphorical bridges occasionally tell the reader how to feel rather than letting the image stand alone, bordering on overwriting in the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("scurried ahead like rats"). Minor overuse of the "Not X. Not Y. Just Z" sentence structure creates a repetitive cadence in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density, with abstract figurations ("living membrane," "frayed edges of memory") often cluttering the sentence level. This overwriting slows momentum and obscures the action, favoring decorative description over narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with "purple" descriptors ("fingers that moved like slow tides," "velvet pause," "honeyed"). This reliance on adjective-heavy metaphors obscures the action and creates a sluggish rhythm that lacks narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on explicit "telling" blocks for character traits ("She was sensitively perceptive—not in the mystical sense..."). Metaphor density is high and sometimes strains for effect ("spines split open like ribs"), creating a texture that is rich but occasionally obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose has a pleasing rhythm and some inventive phrasing ("snack-sized riddles"), but occasionally slips into overwrought description ("fog thicker than regret"). The density of "tell" sentences summarizing Elias's intent slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the vocabulary is evocative, the prose is severely marred by a pervasive syntactic tic; the construction "not [A], but [B]" appears over a dozen times in a short space. This template-cadence issue turns potentially profound observations into a repetitive formula that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is often striking ("last stars like trapped breath"), but the prose occasionally leans into overwrought territory ("bones aching," "swallowed by years"). The density of figurative language is high, which mostly works for this genre but threatens to obscure the physical reality of the scene in moments.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe, pervasive rhetorical scaffold loop ("Not X, but Y") dominates the prose, appearing over fifteen times (e.g., "not flying—unclaimed," "not sound, but fracture," "not to consume, but to merge"). This relentless template cadence destroys rhythmic variety and creates a monotonous, droning texture that distracts significantly from the content.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is ambitious but marred by a significant grammatical error in the climax and a confused metaphor ("dissolving like sugar in cold tea," which implies grittiness rather than dissolution). Hyperbole ("earth itself gasped") strains the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally smooth and rhythmic, with good sensory details ("damp earth and jasmine"). Reliance on filter verbs ("He intuited," "sensation of") and a few abstract summaries ("whisper of wrongness") distance the reader slightly during key realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "As the transformation completes," which appears in two separate paragraphs, creating a jarring loop. Additionally, the density of abstract metaphors ("marrow of moments," "cathedral of revelation") occasionally drifts into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from a density of mixed or melodramatic metaphors ("peels silence like an onion," "tea into bone") that obscure clarity. These "purple" artifacts slow momentum and prioritize decorative phrasing over precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from repetitive vocabulary ("trembling," "trembles," "shivers," "ghost of song," "ghost of firelight") and reliance on familiar similes ("lean like drunken sentinels"). The density of personification (world sighs, greenhouse exhales, beams groan) borders on pathetic fallacy, occasionally distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished and dense, though it leans toward adjectival richness ("honeyed hollows," "professionally thorough precision") that occasionally slows momentum. The imagery is generally vivid and supports the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is polished but often overwritten with "purple" descriptors ("tides in teacups," "harbor’s heartbeat") that prioritize sound over precision. Summarized emotional reactions ("laughed through tears," "stared... for ten full minutes") replace concrete, moment-to-moment sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("trembled like breath"), creating a rich texture. However, the insertion of prompt phrases like "boldly sympathetic" is clunky, and the reliance on elevated descriptors ("luminescent ache") occasionally slows narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. At times, the figurative language becomes dense ("womb of resonance," "embryos in amniotic silence"), slightly clogging the pacing during high-tension beats, but the overall craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.5)
    A pervasive rhetorical tic—the "not X, but Y" sentence structure—appears over ten times ("not death... but something vaguer," "not vengeance... but comprehension"). This repetitive scaffolding creates a monotonous, lecturing rhythm that severely hampers narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is polished but decorative, opening with a weak adverb-adjective pair ("kindly methodical") and relying on abstract metaphors ("fractured sapphire hush," "broken promise"). These stylistic artifacts prioritize lyrical sound over precise, active movement, slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.1)
    While rhythmically smooth, the prose suffers from overwriting and abstract pairings ("baptism of release," "sustaining transformation"). The "liquid circuitry" metaphor clashes tonally with the organic themes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("rattled the shutters like teeth," "bruised clouds"), maintaining momentum. A few images lean slightly conventional ("glowing like a trapped sunset"), but the line-level craft generally supports the tone and pacing without scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from "purple" artifacts and stock imagery ("woven moonlight," "secret too fragile for air"). While technically competent, the reliance on abstract similes over concrete verbs reduces the immediacy of the high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density and "purple" overwriting ("forgotten prayers," "tide-silt in estuaries") that slows momentum. Repeated sentence structures and abstract phrasing create a barrier to visualization.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies excessively on the antithetical construction "not [X], but [Y]" (used approximately 17 times in a short space: "not because it functioned, but because it remembered," "not destruction, but invitation," "not terror, but certainty," etc.). This pervasive stylistic tic creates a monotonous, corrective cadence that distracts significantly from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose rhythm is generally controlled, but the text suffers from adjective density and abstract nominalizations ("weight of longing," "lift of wonder"). The explicit insertion of prompt phrases ("courageously kind attribute") disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("walls screamed," "time hiccuped," "gravity apologized"). This clustering of figurative language during the climax draws attention to the authorial hand and slightly muffles the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from strained metaphors ("viscosity of human distraction") and clichés ("dissolved like sugar"). The shift to summary mode ("Others came") drains the line-level propulsion and replaces sensory immediacy with list-making.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative but dense with compound adjectives (“moss-carved,” “moss-crowned”) and occasionally slips into exposition (“She didn’t mind the quiet”). The summary section creates a rhythmic lull that drags momentum in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    While rhythmically competent, the prose is marred by abstract similes ("edges brittle as forgotten vows") and stock metaphors ("shrouds," "prison bars," "tombstones"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and feel like overwritten "contest prose" rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose has strong moments of rhythm ("cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs"), but is marred by a few notable clichés like "dawn bruised the horizon" and "phantom fingers." The density is high, but the reliance on standard metaphorical tropes in the falling action softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on dense adjective stacks and strained similes ("contracts slither... like eels," "wings shaped like eviction notices turned into origami cranes") that slow momentum. The text prioritizes poetic ornamentation over narrative propulsion, resulting in a static, tableau-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    While competent, the prose relies heavily on emotive clichés ("boots crunching," "throat tight," "marrow," "bleeding dawn") that flatten the specific emotion into generic sentimentality. The technical exposition dump in the middle disrupts the rhythm, and the final lines feel like a rehearsed speech rather than a natural thought.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally obscures clarity ("drinking in the fractured light like a pilgrim"). The reliance on adjectives and elevated phrasing ("alchemy of repair," "sacred spring") tends toward purple prose, prioritizing sound over precise, active description.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative with strong imagery ("star-stung dark," "frostbite ink"). Minor deductions for occasional overwriting and the clunky "subtly confident smirk" tell, but the rhythm generally supports the atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("soles the mallets, her patience the score") but suffers from adjectival density and metaphor stacking, particularly in the opening ("dawn bled," "boots whispering," "fractured keystone" all in one sentence). The figurative language is evocative but occasionally borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    A critical grammatical error ("designed to touches memories") and the awkward repetition of prompt phrases ("gathered hush" x4) severely mar the prose. The text relies on clichéd descriptors ("whispered like mourners") and mechanical sentence structures that reduce the story's literary polish.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant line-level errors undermine the literary aspiration: "it hover" creates a subject-verb agreement failure, and "slipped through the scuffs" is semantically nonsensical. Tense drift ("before they find" within past narration) and clunky phrasing distract from the otherwise vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is often overwritten with dense, abstract metaphors ("intent sharp as shattered crystal") and explanatory artifacts ("hence: lovingly venomous"). The climax utilizes a mechanical template cadence ("Glass panes hummed. Stems straightened.") that dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant "simile fatigue" ("like a question mark," "like cupped palms," "like a heart wrapped in velvet") and overwrought imagery that obscures clarity for the sake of ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on dense, abstract metaphors ("fingers reclaiming forgotten prayers," "magic here was shy") that create a "purple" texture and obscure concrete action with heavy ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and adjective stacking ("honeyed light," "gilded arches," "temple of bygone surface mail"). This density of modifiers creates a slow, decorative rhythm that hampers narrative momentum and leans toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is dense with metaphors and similes (some clichéd, like "fingernails on slate") that slow the pace, and the reliance on summary for action weakens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers heavily from a specific rhetorical artifact: the "not X, but Y" construction appears approximately ten times (e.g., "not to summon... but to evoke," "Not glass... but broad mangrove leaves," "not lost, but planted"). This relentless repetition creates a mechanical, drumbeat rhythm that distracts significantly from the imagery and dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the vocabulary is sophisticated, the prose suffers from excessive overwriting ("lotus-hearted ache," "bruised twilight") and the overwhelming "not X, but Y" syntax loop noted in Q6. These artifacts create a predictable rhythm that draws attention to the writing rather than the story.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose flows well but relies on stock metaphors ("pierced... like a blade," "rippling like water," "skeletal trees") that dilute the imagery's freshness. The climax relies on summary ("The effect was immediate") rather than moment-by-moment unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is marred by a severe "Template Cadence" artifact: the "not [X], but [Y]" sentence structure is used over 14 times in ~600 words. This incessant repetition creates a droning, predictable rhythm that undermines the otherwise vivid vocabulary and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is dense and evocative but marred by repetitive phrasing and adjective stacking. Notably, the prompt phrase "candidly cryptic" appears three times (intro, mid-scene, end) as a static tag, creating a noticeable artifact that flattens the voice. The reliance on dense descriptors ("chitinous observation," "chlorophyll ambition") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density that borders on overwriting (e.g., "constellation spelling 'ARMISTICE' in pollen-script" feels contrived). The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("sea-glass metaphors," "phantom wounds") and simile-heavy descriptions ("like a tide," "like peonies") slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("rage fossilized in amber resin"). However, the repetition of the specific, awkward phrase "foxglove regret" (used twice as a visual descriptor) breaks the flow and feels like a forced insertion of a prompt element rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose has good rhythm and polish ("brick by broken brick"), though it relies on some stock imagery in emotional beats (tears streaking cheeks, hearts pounding louder than footfalls). Adjectival density occasionally slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    A repeated grammatical error ("She slyly heartfelt in her methods," "She slyly heartfelt now") treats an adjective as a verb, breaking syntax and readability. The prose is also frequently overwritten with abstract sensory details ("smelling of regret") that reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of "X like Y" similes (three in the first paragraph alone) and some clichéd phrasing ("tired sentinels," "bruised clouds"). The recurring image of ribs ("cracked open... like a music box" and later "ribs ached") creates a distracting echo.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, though density is high and metaphors are occasionally overwrought ("regret with teeth," "soul overcast"). The phrase "featherly determined" is an awkward construction—likely a forced prompt inclusion—that disrupts the otherwise smooth sentence flow. A few moments of high-concept explanation slow the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is polished with good rhythm, though density is sometimes achieved through adjective stacking rather than active verbs. Metaphors are frequent and generally functional, though some (barnacles sighing) border on twee, softening the intended abyssal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and stock imagery ("liquid honey," "reckless grace"). Adjective density is high ("iridescent," "prismatic," "phosphorescent"), which slows momentum without adding necessary narrative information.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and a reliance on heavy-handed similes ("stretched like saltwater taffy," "static between heartbeats") that clutter the imagery. While mechanically clean, the density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    Significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("curled like a question mark," "permanent asterisk") clutter the prose and reduce impact. The phrasing "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs" creates an unintentional echo, and the noun stack "moonstone cabochon dust speck" disrupts the rhythm of the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the vocabulary is elevated, the prose relies heavily on abstract, "purple" metaphors ("mist clung to glass like memory to regret") that obscure rather than reveal. These artifacts signal an authorial imposition of "poetic" style over concrete clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is heavily "purple," relying on strained metaphors ("ember-kisses," "alchemy of ache," "negotiation with gravity") that obscure meaning with ornamentation. Frequent abstract noun phrases and sentimental descriptors reduce line-level momentum and create a density of "poetic" artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the imagery is lush, the prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts ("lucidly watchful," "lucid watchfulness," "lucid curiosity" appear four times in short succession). Phrases like "hydrodynamic script" and "emotional latitude" veer into abstract "purple" description that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    A severe syntactic artifact creates a rhythmic drone: the "not X, but Y" construction appears at least eight times ("not by choice, but by inheritance"; "not flame, but paper"; "not floorplans, but echoes"). This repetitive template cadence drains the prose of vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe, pervasive syntactic loop ("not [X], but [Y]") appears nine times in a short text, creating a monotonous, algorithmic cadence. This rhetorical crutch dominates the sentence structure ("not with ears, but with," "not spent, not diminished, but amplified"), undermining the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    A severe syntactic loop plagues the text: the "not X, but Y" construction is used over ten times ("not troops, not weapons," "not in prayer," "not superstition," etc.). This repetitive scaffolding creates a sermon-like drone that deadens the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is strong, but the prose suffers from a pervasive rhetorical tic: the "not X, not Y, but Z" construction appears over ten times (e.g., "not paper, but parchment," "not wind, not steam, but sound"). This repetitive antithesis becomes a distraction, creating a mechanical cadence that dulls the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Metaphor density disrupts momentum; nearly every noun is modified or likened to something else ("breath curling like script," "exhale a stanza"). This violates the overwriting check, creating a "purple" texture that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("turning rivets into eyes"), though it occasionally leans into density that slows momentum. A few phrases feel slightly manufactured ("make poison look like calligraphy"), but line-level control is generally high with no distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density and abstraction (e.g., "knotting air with intention," "blushing stillness that blooms"). The reliance on abstract nouns and poetic phrasing sometimes obscures physical action, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory imagery ("warm, amber, trembling"). However, the prompt phrase "snowmelt ardor" feels grafted on, and some imagery leans toward the ornamental ("bruise healing into dawn") rather than the precise.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prompt phrase "precisely playful" is repeated verbatim in a short space, creating a visible scaffold artifact. The prose frequently strains for effect with dense metaphors ("dissolved into honey," "machine tongue") that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a strong rhythm but suffers from the repetitive use of the prompt phrase "empirically ironic" (three times), which feels forced. Some imagery leans into cliché ("time slowed like syrup"), and the anachronistic vocabulary ("decibel," "wavelength") distracts from the line-level texture of the ancient setting.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    While individual images are strong, the prose is severely compromised by a pervasive template cadence (the "Not [A], but [B]" structure appears over 15 times). This algorithmic repetition flattens the rhythm and draws attention to the writing itself, barring publication in a competitive market.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of adjectives and metaphors ("silver-scaled," "molten mercury," "prismatic shards") that slows momentum. The reliance on "Thesaurus-itis" creates a lush texture but sometimes obscures the action ("refracting truth into facets too brilliant"). Mechanics are clean, but the style leans toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally polished and lyrical ("rafters now laced with apple boughs"). There are moments of overwriting where metaphors explain the emotion too directly ("sticky with unresolved emotion," "curled inward like a shy confession"). The phrase "forgotten bag's contents" appears twice and feels slightly stiff/forced.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and vivid but relies heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("glowed like pollen," "hum... like a tuning fork," "pulsed like embryonic stars," "clinging... like static," "folded... like origami traps"). This recurring syntactic scaffold ("verb + like + noun phrase") becomes noticeable and slightly dulls the immediacy of the imagery in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery ("humming... like a tuning fork struck wrong"). There is a slight tendency toward overwrought metaphor ("semantic blooms," "mountain’s marrow"), but the linguistic texture generally supports the premise. Rhythm is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative ("swallowed by salt and silence"), though it occasionally leans into standard surrealist tropes or slight overwriting. The sentence-level rhythm is generally strong, supporting the dream-like atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is rhythmically sound and polished, with good information density. However, the text occasionally explains its own metaphors (e.g., "symbolized by the seal") rather than trusting the image to carry the weight, slightly distancing the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rhythmically assured and dense with specific imagery, avoiding scaffold loops or generic descriptors. Phrasing like "webbed with hairline fractures like a shattered mirror refusing to fall" demonstrates strong control and successfully sustains the story's ethereal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose has rhythm but relies on stock imagery ("frozen tear," "pregnant pause," "cooling honey") that dulls the line-level impact. While grammatically clean, the reliance on familiar metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving genuine freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Line-level craft is severely damaged by the "Not X, but Y" template cadence (16 instances), which creates a persistent artifact. There are also clear errors, such as the tautological "The forecourt... held the crystal whispering forecourt" and the grammatical break "a task she’d preemptively nostalgic for."

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is vivid and dense, with strong rhythm, but relies too heavily on simile constructions ("like overripe fruit," "like slow-burning fuses," "like a talisman," "like syrup," "like a constellation"). While the imagery is sharp, this repetitive syntactic scaffolding occasionally draws attention away from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe syntactic monotony: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not speech, but silence," "not facts but textures," "not visions, but impressions"). This relentless template cadence creates a droning rhythm that flattens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm and cadence are strong, but the prose leans purple ("tongue of the soul," "gratitude made visible"). The integration of required phrases like "intangibly tangible" creates momentary awkwardness that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative but occasionally overwrought with adjectives ("liquid shards," "subsonic lullaby"). The verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "fluidly logical" creates a minor mechanical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.0)
    The text contains a significant spelling error ("sallyed" instead of "sallied") and ungrammatical usage ("moved wisely adventurous"). Heavy use of adjective-noun pairings ("bioluminescent cores," "ancient hydraulics") slows the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is fatally compromised by severe syntactic repetition: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears over 15 times (e.g., "not with fire, but with measured silence," "not metaphor, but mechanism"). This mechanical template cadence creates a droning rhythm that dominates the text.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose suffers from metaphor stacking (&quot;hollowed-out trust and calloused hope&quot;) and specific clichés (&quot;smelling of ozone and old libraries&quot;) that dull the imagery. Repetitive phrasing (&quot;Shadows stitched... shadowseam&quot;) creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe rhetorical tic pervades the text: the construction "not [X], but [Y]" appears over ten times (e.g., "not from absence... but because," "not as poets... but as hunters," "not political... personal"). This mechanical repetition creates a distracting, drumbeat cadence that severely harms flow.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.4)
    A severe "template cadence" artifact dominates the prose: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction is used over 13 times (e.g., "not to bind, but to balance," "not rain, but threads"). This repetitive syntax deadens the rhythm, turning the narrative into a predictable list of negations rather than a flowing story.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and purple artifacts ("whispers, in gradients," "silent ache," "gleaming faintly"). The opening image ("dust motes danced") is a well-known cliché. The reliance on abstract nouns and sentimental adjectives dilutes the vividness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "simile-itis," with frequent "like a [noun]" constructions ("like a stain," "like cheap thread," "like veins") that clutter the imagery. Phrasing often leans on clichés ("heart drumming against her ribs") and melodrama ("water cool as forgotten truth") rather than precise, concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing and visible scaffolding. "Negative space" and "vested hush" are each repeated verbatim within a short space, and the "Noun in mist" construction appears twice, creating a robotic cadence. Clichés like "ink in milk" detract from the otherwise competent density.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is dense with imagery but suffers from heavy adjective stacking ("moonstone cabochon dust speck") and awkward grammatical fits ("emerged transformed always"). The repeated insertion of prompt phrases creates noticeable artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and abstract-concrete mixing ("cinnamon and memory") that reads as artificial. The repetition of the prompt phrase "uncertainly certain" feels clunky, and metaphors like "question posed by gravity" obscure clarity for the sake of poetic sounding grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is competent but overwrought with figurative language ("weeping skylights," "molten ambition," "fireflies of starlight"), which creates density at the expense of immediacy in the climax. The phrase "factually mystical" is integrated awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like a child to a blanket," "like a secret," "like mercury," "like broken hymns") that clogs the rhythm. This tendency toward overwriting creates a "purple" texture that obscures the immediate physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe, pervasive syntactic artifact—the "Not X, but Y" construction—appears over 15 times ("Not by design, but by survival," "Not visual, but visceral," etc.). This repetitive template creates a robotic, sermon-like rhythm that dratically flattens the prose and obscures narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("gears tick like heartbeats," "edges sharp as regret") that clogs momentum and borders on purple. While grammatically clean, the relentless figurative language draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene, reducing narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    There are moments of excellent sensory precision ("vibrated in his molars"), but the prose suffers from occasional heavy-handedness ("Analysis was his liturgy") and clunky phrasing ("skillfully observant eyes"). Some descriptions rely on familiar tropes (popcorn/sawdust) rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery ("pooled in corners like spilled ink"). However, it occasionally leans into abstraction or stock poetic similes ("heavy as a dying star," "thinner than thought") that soften the impact of the physical description.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but suffers from occasional filter verbs ("He noticed," "He realized") and slightly purple metaphors ("rosary of regrets," "winds howled like widows"). These artifacts reduce immediacy during what should be high-sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    A severe "template cadence" artifact undermines the prose: the construction "Not X, but Y" is used over 10 times ("Not shattered, not broken," "not with judgment, but sorrow," "Not to fix it, but to remind it," etc.). This creates a droning, formulaic rhythm that dulls the emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and sensory-rich, demonstrating good control of rhythm. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting ("dying breath," "silence... vibrated in her molars") or abstract phrasing that values sound over clarity. The density is high, but the reliance on similes sometimes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectives and metaphors ("signal dissolving like salt," "coaxing stories"), which occasionally stalls momentum. Mandatory phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "scaffold complexity" feel inserted verbatim rather than woven naturally into the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose leans into "purple" description ("icicles weeping... like reluctant farewells," "quiet thunder," "bruised the horizon"), prioritizing lushness over precision. This results in a density of metaphors that distracts from the action and feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is polished but often purple, relying on adjective stacking ("unbearable, searing reverie") and clichés ("witching hour," "spilled ink"). While there are strong lines ("throat refusing testimony"), the density of metaphors in summary passages slows the momentum and feels overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from a severe syntactic artifact: the "not [A], but [B]" construction appears over a dozen times, creating a monotonous, lecturing rhythm that stifles the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with some striking lines ("hush like a dropped stitch"). However, a few clichés ("cotton-candy clouds," "pea-soup gloom," "sugar in tea") and moments of overwriting ("spores of empathy") dilute the otherwise high textural quality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is marred by a pervasive "Not X, but Y" syntactic pattern (used >10 times, e.g., "not from cold but from," "not a creature, but a silence," "not calm, not frantic, but vibrating"). This rhetorical loop creates a repetitive, sermon-like cadence that distracts from the otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.0)
    A severe template cadence artifact pervades the text: the &quot;not [A], but [B]&quot; construction appears at least eight times (&quot;not merely as a phrase but as a vow,&quot; &quot;not panic, but in promise,&quot; etc.). This repetitive scaffolding drains momentum and makes the prose feel formulaic despite vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density and "purple" phrasing ("gravitational sigh," "velvet dark") that obscures clarity. There are noticeable artifact patterns in the rhythm (He [verb], then [verb]) and a reliance on clichés ("kissed into oblivion") that dull the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" artifacts ("sky bleached of mercy," "scribe of sighs," "wind dared whisper"). This density of figurative language slows momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene, violating the economy bias expected in high-end literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lyrical and flows well, but leans on standard "poetic" structures (abstract noun + of + abstract noun lists like "grit of joy, silk of sorrow") that verge on sentimentality. While technically clean, the reliance on metaphors like "ribs expand" and "ghosts of gestures" creates a density that sometimes obscures the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is overwritten, with a high density of figurative language (metaphors and similes in nearly every sentence of the opening) that stifles momentum. Phrases like "falling star made of twine" and "bell ringing over wet stone" compete for attention, creating a texture that feels decorative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong visual verbs ("threaded," "pulsed," "darkened"). However, the reliance on summarizing emotions ("quiet thrill," "no regret") rather than dramatizing them weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Repetitive phrasing (the "bronze quiet" motif appears three times; the "dusty footprints" phrase is repeated verbatim) and some purple prose reduce polish.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from figurative overcrowding ("tired lung," "green scream," "bruised purple"). The density of metaphors occasionally stalls momentum and feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmically competent but suffers from "purple" modifiers ("burnt umber kissed with ochre"). The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("intuitively descriptive," "bloodhound retired from finding bodies") acts as a scaffold that breaks immersion. The text tells rather than shows key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    A pervasive template artifact ("not X, but Y") appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not magnetic... nor even geographic," "not faster, not slower," "not to capture... but to turn"), creating a repetitive, corrective cadence that severely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and abstract metaphor ("wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods," "endgames that wept like widows"). These "purple" artifacts and clichés obscure the physical reality of the scene and reduce the emotional impact to melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose is rhythmic, the verbatim repetition of unique phrases ("benevolently ruthless" and "luminous absence" each appear three times) creates a distracting, mechanical echo. Some metaphors border on purple ("ghost of speech," "trailing edge of displaced light"), reducing line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.0)
    While vocabulary is rich ("luminescence," "quicksilver"), the prose is crippled by a pervasive structural tic: the repetitive use of negation-affirmation structures ("not because... but because," "not magic... but the shape," "not with words... but via"). This rhetorical scaffold appears frequently enough to constitute a major stylistic artifact that hinders flow and publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("tasted like ash," "held their breath") and awkward modifiers ("fidgeted productively") that disrupt immersion. While rhythmic, the reliance on stock metaphors prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose rhythm is strong, with memorable images like "glass birds nesting in rib cages." However, the text suffers from abstract labeling ("emotional residue," "devotion to complexity") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience. A reduction in filter words and abstract nouns would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of strained similes ("tail curled like a question mark," "pockmarks like lunar craters") and adjective clutter. This stylistic overwriting draws attention to the author's hand and slows the momentum of the crisis scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is competent and rhythmic but occasionally purple; metaphors like "lapping... like a tongue tasting its own edge" feel strained. Information density is good, but clichés like "ghosts of smugglers’ lanterns" detract.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is heavily overwritten ("purple"), densely packed with abstract metaphors and oxymorons ("screaming tenderness," "humming with the memory") that obscure clarity. The high density of adjectives and "writerly" phrasing slows momentum and draws attention to the author rather than the story. It reads more like a prose poem than a narrative scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is polished, it relies heavily on rhetorical scaffolding (multiple "Not X, but Y" constructions) and dense metaphor ("tunes her bones like a theremin"). The frequent use of sentence fragments and list-like structures ("Altars of static. Shrines of dial tones.") creates a repetitive cadence that feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from metaphor density and pathetic fallacy ("mycelium whispered," "fungal wisdom," "orchard sighing") that borders on overwriting. A noticeable lexical echo ("bruised clouds" followed closely by "dawn bruised") and the overuse of prompt words ("occlude") in close proximity distract from the otherwise polished rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is competent but suffers from a high density of similes and metaphorical overwriting (e.g., three separate "mist like X" constructions). The heavy reliance on adjectives ("opal," "pearlescent," "indigo") slows momentum and feels decorative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is mechanically sound but suffers from "adjectivitis" and clunky phrasing, particularly the repetition of "empirically intuitive." The reliance on filter verbs and explaining emotions ("quiet awe") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting. Phrases like "whispered against her skin like regret" and "dusk curling its fingers" lean heavy on abstraction and personification, creating distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is competent but overwritten, frequently prioritizing poetic density over clarity ("density of presence that clung to silence like dew"). The reliance on abstract metaphors ("frequencies of his guilt") creates a "purple" texture that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and rich with imagery ("quills against parchment," "eyes hollow"), but suffers from "telling" artifacts where the narrator summarizes emotional states instead of dramatizing them. Phrases like "a habit as corrosive as it is predictable" act as scaffolding that slows momentum. The writing is polished but occasionally overwrought, prioritizing aphorism over immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language ("waiting like lungs," "calm as moonlit water," "low as a tide," "open like a ribcage") appearing in close succession. While the images are consistent, their frequency slows momentum and feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bird’s beak parting fog"). There is a tendency toward slightly dense, mixed metaphor ("wool soaked in honey") that slows momentum. However, the line-level craft generally supports the magical atmosphere without confusing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm. A few similes lean toward density ("voice rough as torn sheet music," "hush... settled like dust"), but the imagery generally enhances the "ethereal grit" tone. No mechanical artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several tired tropes ("silence pooled thicker than ink," "lidless eyes") and mixed metaphors ("hiccup/blink/synapse"). The density is good, but the reliance on abstract genitive constructions ("fabric of," "gauze of," "layers of") softens the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is rhythmic but prone to overwriting and "telling" artifacts that flatten the mystique ("It wasn’t magic. It was mechanics with meaning"). The reliance on abstract summaries of insight ("He understood: clocks measured absence") interrupts the scene's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished and sensory-rich ("indigo silence," "pulsing caps"). The density is high and rhythms are controlled, though the forced inclusion of "quiet wildfire" creates a mixed metaphor that slightly disrupts the otherwise slow, fluid semantic field.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but dense with adjectival phrasing ("rainwashed," "compulsive," "threadbare," "cryptic") that slows momentum. While the repetition of "rainwashed" frames the narrative, the reliance on high-register descriptors creates a slight distance from the raw action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("fragile root," "crystalline sigh"). The repetition of the "hum of streetlamps" serves as a rhythmic refrain, but the looping of the thesis statement ("endings/begin") in both narration and dialogue reads more like a scaffold or lecture than an organic motif.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.0)
    A massive syntactic artifact pervades the text: the "not [A], but [B]" construction appears 11 times in a short space, destroying rhythm and creating a template-like feel. Additionally, the phrase "worked gently thorough" is a grammatical error (adjective modifying a verb) caused by forcing a prompt element.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language to the point of overwriting ("draped in ivy like a forgotten cathedral," "worlds collapsing under silence"). While the imagery is evocative, the density of metaphors slows momentum. The ending relies on a rhetorical scaffold ("Not X, or Y, but Z") that feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("vowel shaped like gratitude," "consonant forged from courage") that obscure clarity for the sake of poetic sound. Some phrasing ("secrets only silence could carry") leans on cliché paradoxes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive metaphor density ("metaphysical kernels," "entropy’s cruel editing") that blurs the line between physical action and abstract thought. This overwriting creates opacity, slowing momentum without adding concrete sensory information.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten with dense, mixed metaphors ("voice... weight of cathedral bells") and abstract emotional telling ("Joy, because... Sorrow, because"). The reliance on adjectives and explanatory sentence stems stifles momentum and obscures concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and metaphor stacking ("threads brittle as dried veins," "frayed silence"). There is a reliance on "emotional arithmetic" ("wept then, not from grief, but recognition") and filter verbs that explain internal states instead of showing them. The rhythm becomes list-like during the creation sequence ("She painted... She carved... She wove..."), creating a mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the rhythmic flow is competent, the prose relies heavily on stock metaphors and clichés ("iron to a magnet," "compass left in the storm," "cells in a petri dish"). These artifacts dilute the vividness of the more original imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good information density ("rust-streaked shipping containers that swallowed whole blocks"). There are minor repetitive sentence structures in the conclusion ("No sirens, no spectacle"), but overall line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is evocative ("drowned sapphire") but occasionally overwrought with adjective density. The prompt phrase "spiralingly calm" appears twice, creating a repetitive artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery (chess trees, equations on branches). It suffers slightly from "purple" tendencies—heavily adjectival descriptions and metaphorical density ("sigh of unread epics")—that slow momentum without adding narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of melodramatic similes ("cold as regret," "heavy as silence after a scream") and abstract noun pairings. Rhetorical template cadence ("Not from shore... but from the deep," "Not to mend nets but to mend souls") creates a repetitive, sermon-like rhythm that dulls narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with standout phrasing like "smiled without muscle" and "ash is amnesty." However, opening with "skeletal sentinels" and "shavings curling like ghosts" relies on slightly worn literary tropes that detract from the otherwise sharp, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely marred by a repetitive "not [X], but [Y]" sentence structure, which appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not out of patience, but because," "not to conquer, but to coexist"). This rhetorical tic creates a monotonous, lecturing cadence that stalls momentum and distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally high-quality with strong sensory density ("brittle crackle," "damp velvet"). Occasional adjectival stacking ("innocently cunning persistence") and slightly abstract phrasing ("silence thick with rebirth") hold it back from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is rhythmically sound and lyrical but leans into overwriting, with dense metaphors that occasionally clutter the imagery ("echoes had fossilized," "grain beneath the gloss"). The rhetorical question blocks disrupt the narrative flow, reading more like an essay than fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("delicate as fractured veins," "scraped her soul to marrow"). The density of abstract nouns (grief, sorrow, redemption, closure) flattens the imagery, prioritizing aesthetic sounding phrases over clarity and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but dense with similes ("like a forgotten bassline," "like a dormant serpent," "like tide heights"), creating a heavy, overwrought texture. The reliance on "like/as" constructions in close proximity draws attention to the author's hand and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose has momentum but suffers from abstract metaphors and clichés that dull precision. "Hues of molten regret," "galaxies of unshed tears," and "nails bit her palms" are stock or purple artifacts that detract from otherwise solid imagery. Rhythm is generally good.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on repetitive adjectival stacks (repeating "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret" verbatim). Some imagery leans toward the ornamental ("cathedral of forgetting," "bruised violet"), which occasionally clogs the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose relies heavily on stock similes ("curled like breath," "sturdy as oak," "cracked like thin ice," "pulsing like slow heartbeats"). These clichés undercut the literary ambition. While the rhythm is smooth, the figurative language is often decorative rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense with imagery and maintains a strong rhythm, though it occasionally veers into purple territory ("dawn's full blush," "roots murmured secrets"). The description of the coffee rings telling stories is a standout moment of high-density writing. Mechanics are clean, though some metaphors feel slightly stacked.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and polished, with the "hushed thunder" motif effectively framing the piece. However, reliance on stock imagery like "origami birds" and "satin gloves" leans into cliché, preventing the language from feeling truly fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from metaphor congestion ("stardust... like pollen," "cathedral of unfinished hymns," "tuning forks") that stifles momentum. The climax is obscured by melodramatic flourishes ("tears... glittering like dew on spider silk") where precise action is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe stylistic artifact dominates the prose: the "not [X], but [Y]" sentence structure appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not by choice, but by design," "not a relic, but a key"). This repetitive negative definition creates a monotonous template cadence that stalls momentum and distracts heavily from the content.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetitive syntax creates a template cadence artifact: the "not [X], but [Y]" structure appears over ten times ("not because... but because," "not with his ears, but," "not falling, but floating"). This pervasive device kills propulsion and creates a droning rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, suffering from density issues and strained metaphors ("roots that curled like question marks," "bracken that sighed open and shut like a secret mouth"). These artifacts obscure physical logic and stall momentum in favor of ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the rhythm is generally good, the prose suffers from "writerly" artifacts and ornamental clustering ("seraphically mundane grace," "scholars of silence, archivists of absence"). Phrases like "stitched into his marrow" feel like stock metaphors. These stylistic flourishes reduce information density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of metaphors and similes ("dense as grief," "stones remembering... like a sigh") that obscures concrete detail and slows momentum. This "lyric" padding replaces the necessary friction of action, resulting in a text that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through specific imagery. The writing is polished but frequently overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with heavy similes ("metal bones groaning like an old sailor," "frayed like nerve endings"). These artifacts draw attention to the writing rather than the moment. Line-level propulsion is generally good, though the summary ending flattens the texture in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.6)
    A severe rhetorical artifact pervades the text: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears in almost every paragraph (e.g., "not escaped, but to discover," "not a sound, but a vibration," "not electric, but bioluminescent"). This repetitive template cadence creates a droning rhythm that flattens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    Severe syntactic monotony due to the relentless use of the "Not [A], but [B]" construction (e.g., "not for glory... but because," "not with guns... but with memory"). This template cadence appears in nearly every paragraph, destroying prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    A repetitive syntactic artifact ("Not [X], not [Y], but [Z]") appears at least five times (e.g., "Not anchor, not burden, but compass," "Not literal... but a dewdrop"), creating a monotonous, sermon-like cadence. This rhetorical scaffolding distracts from the otherwise capable sensory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is severely hampered by a pervasive "antithesis loop" artifact; the construction "not [A], but [B]" (or variations like "nor... but") is used in nearly every paragraph, creating a droning, algorithmic cadence. While individual images are striking, this structural repetition signals a lack of syntactic control. Additionally, metaphors are occasionally mixed or cliché ("leaned like drunkards," "scent of ozone").

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    While imagery is generally strong, the prose is occasionally marred by clichés ("stretched like taffy") and overwrought phrasing ("Rorschach of impermanence"). These text artifacts draw attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is marred by "telling" artifacts, most notably the adverb-adjective cluster "bravely conflicted storm within," which flattens emotional complexity into a label. The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("within the blink that follows surprise") creates rhythmic hiccups in otherwise competent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("tranquil blaze," "liquid gold"), though occasionally overwrought or imprecise ("senselessly perceptive" reads awkwardly). Phrasing like "inculcated plants with values" feels abstract and summary-heavy amidst the sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    A severe stylistic artifact dominates the prose: the "not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times ("not stars, but sentient," "not translates, not interprets," "not to anchor, but to conduct," etc.). This relentless template cadence stalls momentum and turns narrative beats into static definitions.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on dense, decorative similes ("as if deciphering Braille," "smoldering like embers") that slow momentum. Several lines drift into purple prose, and the reliance on filter verbs ("She remembered," "She watched") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose has momentum, it suffers from strained metaphors (ink "trembling like a newborn’s breath") and mixed imagery (digital "firmware" in analog "vacuum tubes"). The high density of adjective-noun pairings ("meteor hush," "harmonic dissonance") creates a textured but occasionally overwrought surface.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but marred by a few clichés ("second skin," "curled like breath") and a tendency to over-explain imagery. The final paragraph devolves into summary to deliver the moral, reducing the impact of the rain imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("powdered grief," "whispered... mourning aloud") that feels ornamental rather than urgent. The insertion of the prompt term "retrocognitively trapped" creates a jarring register clash (clinical/jargon vs. mythic) that disrupts the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with high adjective density and abstract metaphors ("curtain calls that intertwined with the rustling leaves"). There is a repetitive syntactic scaffolding in the resolution ("The woman... The teenager... The old man...") that flattens the rhythm of the epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lexical repetition significantly hampers the prose quality. The word "somatic" appears eight times, often acting as a placeholder for description rather than evoking it. "Fractally precise" and "willowglass hope" are also repeated, creating a loop artifact that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe syntactic artifact pervades the text: the "not X, but Y" construction appears nearly ten times, creating a monotonous drumbeat that strangles flow (e.g., "not to observe, but to participate; not to record, but to respond"). Additionally, synonym churn ("not levitate, not hover, but float") halts momentum to parse definitions.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is fatally compromised by the overuse of the "Not X, but Y" rhetorical device, which appears over 15 times ("not hours, but to measure," "not time, but truth," "not prediction... but raw possibility"). This creates a lecturing, algorithmic rhythm that destroys narrative momentum and reads more like a manifesto than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" tendencies and metaphor confusion (e.g., storms as ciphers). The repetition of the prompt phrase "prudently daring" (once as action, once as attribute) feels mechanical and creates a redundant echo.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with figurative language ("syncopated like tide," "bones had grown roots"), creating a purple texture that slows momentum. Required phrases are inserted with visible seams (e.g., the coffee simile), resulting in rhythmic stumbles and tonal inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose has a strong rhythm and generally high functionality, but suffers from occasional overwriting and metaphor density ("liquid regret," "fractured timelines"). These abstractions sometimes blur the concrete cause-and-effect on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is dense with personification and adjective-heavy phrasing ("crimson sigh," "wept its last fragrance," "trembling beams") that creates a purple, overwrought texture. While rhythmically functional, the reliance on poetic sentimentality obscures the concrete action and reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is severely hampered by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakenings," "contemporary of extinct species," "translate isolation into independence") multiple times within a short word count. This creates a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that breaks immersion. Additionally, reliance on "not X, but Y" sentence structures becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and abstract pairings ("petrichor and possibility") that prioritize sound over clarity. Similes like "coiled like a question mark made of nature" strain for effect and disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong images ("peeling skin from an apple"). However, artifacts like direct address ("Think of it as...") and summarized reactions ("One freshman posted...") flatten the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the prose has moments of lyricism, it suffers from adjective clutter ("vital key," "physical key," "harmonic cipher"). The subject-verb agreement error ("It transfix her") is a disqualifying proofreading lapse for a flawless-standard publication.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and strained metaphors ("furrowed hush," "lanced the mystery"). While there are moments of strong imagery, the density of figurative language ("mind a lattice of data points") often clogs the pacing. Rhythmic monotony in sentence structures flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose demonstrates strong imagery ("Clouds unspooled backward") and rhythmic control, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("glaciers wept"). Line-level mechanics are clean, but the density of metaphors sometimes crowds the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose density is high but marred by simile reliance (“like smoke,” “like resin,” “like mist,” “like prayer flags”) and the awkward, repeated modifier stack “dynamically observant.” These artifacts create a “written” feel that obstructs immersion and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("ghost of some distant heist," "metallic lullaby"), prioritizing adjective density over momentum. The imagery is strong, though the reliance on abstract philosophical statements flattens the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("velvet night," "dawn's first blush," "liquid shadow") and mixed metaphors that prioritize sound over clarity. Phrases like "meteor showers of mercy" and "dew on petals at midnight" read as sentimental purple prose rather than precise literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by an excessive reliance on "not X, but Y" antithesis constructions (appearing 10+ times, e.g., "not with pain, but release," "not screams, but songs"). This repetitive template cadence becomes a distracting drone that flattens the climax and denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.0)
    A severe repetitive artifact dominates the prose: the "not X, but Y" construction appears at least eight times (e.g., "not in panic but in precise hunger," "not as trophy, but as key," "not to trap her, but to anchor her"). This syntactic loop destroys the rhythm and reads as a rhetorical crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    While imagery is lush, the prose suffers from a repetitive "Not X, but Y" syntactic template (used five times: "not in fear, but recognition," "not to soothe, but to anchor," etc.). This rhetorical scaffolding becomes noticeable and dulls the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("shifting gravel like a beast chewing stone"), with good rhythmic control. A few moments lean into cliché (the dramatic laptop opening), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality and free of major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but leans heavily on a repetitive rhetorical structure of negation/antithesis ("Not X. Not Y. But Z.") which becomes a tic. Some filtering verbs ("felt that echo") and slightly overwrought phrases ("terror of nearing truth") detract from the otherwise high-quality imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    Syntactic monotony is pervasive, relying heavily on a "She [verb], [participial phrase]" sentence structure that creates a lulling, repetitive cadence. High density of abstract nouns (essence, entropy, flux, fixture) creates "concept churn" that obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical overcrowding and clichés ("symphony of a thousand stifled dreams," "liquid gold," "ghost fingers"). The high density of adjectives and "resonant" descriptors slows momentum without adding distinct informational value.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract metaphors ("contour lines of shame," "elevation markers of remorse") that sometimes clutter the imagery. The usage of the required word "alluded" feels mechanical and slightly imprecise ("alluded to it... as compass"), disrupting the narrative flow. Rhythm is generally strong, supporting the melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally polished but marred by a severe "template cadence" artifact in the latter half, where over a dozen sentences begin with "She [verb]." The "soared like a kite" simile is a cliché that weakens the text.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and image-dense ("bruised mulberries against indigo silk"), creating a strong visual experience. However, it occasionally lapses into overwriting or clunky metaphors ("perforated destiny—full of holes"), and the sheer density of adjectives sometimes slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is evocative, it suffers from significant lexical loops, specifically the word "lucid" or "lucidly" appearing five times and "watchful" three times in a short space. These artifacts, combined with a heavy density of adjectives, create a textural drag that obscures the narrative's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from simile saturation ("like old promises," "like wine," "like dropped crystal," "like a tide") that clutters the imagery and slows momentum. High-density figurative language in non-peak beats creates a "purple" texture that obscures the physical reality of the scene rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on several clichéd metaphors ("clinging to the last thread," "sigh like a long-held breath"). The density is diluted by abstract phrasing ("sincerity wrapped in artifice") that tells rather than shows the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the imagery is often evocative ("time made visible"), the prose suffers from logical artifacts like "youth trapped in old bones," which contradicts the backward-aging premise (she should be an old soul in a young body). Filter verbs ("He believed," "He didn't yet see") occasionally distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe overuse of the antithesis sentence structure ("not for war, but for memory," "not magic, nor divine," "not with hope, but with... resolve") creates a distractingly repetitive drumbeat (10+ instances). This "template cadence" artifact flattens the prose and reduces line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is often strong, but a jarring grammatical error in a pivotal beat ("He unstrap the satchel") disrupts momentum. Some metaphorical density ("memory to regret") borders on abstraction, but the line-level propulsion is generally maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.0)
    Simile density is obstructive ("like drowned stars," "like anemones," "like a vow," "like bioluminescent plankton," "like stained glass"), creating a drag on momentum. Sentence structures are repetitive, heavily relying on "He [verb]" openers that create a monotonous cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagery ("dissolving like sugar") is undercut by redundant similes ("pulsed... like a dying pulsar") and clunky phrasing ("wavelength align"). Some abstract descriptions slow the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("whispering like regret," "like frost," "like stones," "like fallen leaves") that becomes decorative. Additionally, the phrase "echoes forgotten phrases" appears twice with awkward grammar (missing "of"), disrupting the syntactic flow and creating visible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("curling like vines," "question mark against the dawn"), though it occasionally drifts into slightly precious or overwrought metaphors ("fist of a disappointed god"). The rhythm flows well, mirroring the slow, methodical pacing of the ritual, though the repetition of "lukewarm" draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the opening paragraphs suffer from metaphor density (sighs, bleeding colors, knuckles) that borders on overwriting. While the imagery is evocative, the clustering of figurative language occasionally slows the momentum and calls attention to the writing itself rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.0)
    A severe "Template Cadence" artifact dominates the prose: the "not [A], but [B]" construction is used approximately 20 times in a short text (e.g., "not with water alone, but with," "not to escape, but to anchor," "not moisture, but memory"). This repetitive structure acts as a scaffold that obscures the story's movement and creates a monotonous rhythm, overriding the content's potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is functional but relies on several clichés ("silence screamed," "scattered like leaves," "stone dropped in still water") that dull the imagery. A tendency toward repetitive sentence openings in the second half ("She unclipped," "She re-clipped," "She turned") creates a mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.0)
    A severe stylistic artifact dominates the prose: the "not X, but Y" construction appears over ten times (e.g., "not electricity, but resonance," "not flesh, not bone, but light"). This repetitive syntax creates a lecturing rhythm and acts as a scaffold for meaning, replacing concrete description with rhetorical definition. The constant defining of what things *are not* stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    A rigid template cadence ("not [X], but [Y]") appears five times, creating a repetitive rhetorical loop that stalls momentum. The prose relies heavily on "telling" via summary and occasionally leans on clichés ("liquid mercury").

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor stacking ("boots echoing like dropped metronomes," "silence, thick and syrupy"). The repeated misuse of "macerate" (which means to soften by soaking, not to crush or tear) is distracting. The density of similes and adjectives clogs the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from a repetitive "Not X, but Y" sentence structure (e.g., "not as walls, but as membranes," "not destructive, but connective," "not as exile, but as emissary"). This template appears over ten times, turning the narrative into a list of definitions and stalling momentum. Without this structural crutch, the imagery would shine much brighter.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.0)
    A severe stylistic artifact pervades the text: the "not X, but Y" sentence structure appears in nearly every paragraph, creating a distracting drumbeat rhythm. Additionally, the idiom "when the penny dropped" clashes jarringly with the established high-fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose rhythm is generally strong with evocative imagery, but the text suffers from repetitive artifacts. The phrase "serenely electric" appears four times in under 600 words, creating a noticeable loop that disrupts the otherwise polished flow.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose flows rhythmically but suffers from overwriting and abstract metaphors ("crystallized like frost on brass"). The reliance on filter verbs ("He realized then") and summary distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severe overuse of antithetical sentence structures ("not X, but Y") creates a monotonous, didactic rhythm (occurring ~10 times, e.g., "not escape or spectacle, but," "not with fabric, but with moments," "not collapsed—split"). Lush imagery occasionally slips into cliché ("sluggish as tar").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from adverb reliance ("softly," "balancedly") and filter verbs; the ending speech halts momentum with rhetorical scaffolding rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but overwrought, relying heavily on adjectives and similes ("bruised twilight," "surrendered hands," "liquid gold puddles"). Diagnostic labeling ("fractured by grief") and template sentence structures in action beats dampen the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and largely free of mechanical artifacts or loops, with strong sentence-level propulsion. The imagery is vivid ("ribs now fused with limestone"), though the density of metaphor occasionally threatens to slow momentum. The technical execution is high-quality, serving the atmospheric needs of the story without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by a pervasive "antithesis loop" artifact, using the structure "It wasn't [A], it was [B]" or "Not [A], but [B]" over 12 times in a short space. While individual images are striking ("dendritic veins"), this syntactic monotony creates a drumbeat rhythm that severely harms flow and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from high simile density ("like shattered cathedrals," "like trapped screams," "like salt," "like old parchment"), creating a scaffolded rhythm that dulls momentum. The climax relies on abstract noun phrases ("rasp of longing," "hush of regret") instead of concrete imagery, weakening the visual impact of the sound magic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is dense and polished but suffers from metaphorical clutter in peak beats ("frostbitten heartbeats," "origami," "confetti" in close proximity). A usage error appears in the climax ("The metamorphose began" uses the verb as a noun), and list-like sentence structures reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans toward purple ("music poured out like blood"). The specific prompt phrase "resonantly soft" is used twice, creating a repetitive artifact that draws attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and a high density of "scaffold" similes ("like a skipped heartbeat," "like dying stars," "like constellations"). The phrase "smelled like... regret" is a specific line-level artifact (abstract sensory mixing) that signals a lack of grounding. The density of adjectives and metaphorical pairings slows momentum and obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    Simile density stifles momentum (mist like cats, time like syrup, sign like skin, cars like beasts, halo like star); the reliance on "noun like X" constructions creates a repetitive cadence and figurative clutter that distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative with strong imagery. There is a slight reliance on a repetitive rhetorical structure ("Not X, but Y") to define concepts, but the line-level craft generally supports the atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and high figurative density ("hours stitched together," "pulse of solar breath"), often obscuring physical action. The use of abstract nouns to define magic properties ("hue of hope," "gold of irreversible loss") tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking it through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose relies heavily on abstract padding ("hush of cosmic possibility," "latent power") and adjective-noun pairings that dilute immediacy. The density of concrete information is low, obscured by "purple" descriptions that tell rather than show.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level imagery is vivid ("seeped, like groundwater"), but the prose occasionally leans on scaffold sentences to explain motivation ("Her motivation was surgical"). Information density is high, though a few "not X but Y" constructions create a repetitive rhythmic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    A pervasive template cadence ("not X, but Y") appears over 12 times, including at the closure beat ("not because... but because"). This repetitive structure turns the prose into a formulaic list, severely hampering flow and variety.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and cliché ("dawn’s first blush kissed the mist," "moss that sighed," "sculpted silence"). Abstract nouns are frequently used in place of concrete imagery, and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive repetitive cadence ("She began," "She worked," "She hesitated," "She coiled," "She rose"), creating a monotonous rhythm. Additionally, the density of "Noun of Noun" metaphors and ornamental phrasing ("gale of withheld truth") clutters the line-level clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe syntactic tic ("not X but Y") appears over fifteen times, creating a monotonous, algorithmic rhythm that distracts from the imagery. This template cadence dominates the prose, reducing the impact of otherwise evocative descriptions and stifling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from high "simile churn," with "like" constructions appearing in dense clusters ("like librarians," "like a plea," "like equations," "like an old colleague"). This scaffolding dulls the impact of the stronger, concrete images ("flakes falling upward").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is weighed down by modifier stacking and worn clichés ("time stretched like taffy," "silence rang like struck crystal"). Required phrases like "driftingly alert" feel inserted mechanically, disrupting the rhythm and drawing attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("softer than snowfall," "cracked like frozen rivers," "spiraling like breath," "like a held breath") that creates drag. Clichéd phrasing ("stories untold," "whispered... by the wind") and abstract descriptors weaken the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished, with high information density. However, a few metaphors border on the ornate ("starlight that clung like powdered memory," "ozone and awe"), risking a slight density penalty. The line-level craft generally supports the dreamlike, grief-stricken atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and dense, but the required phrase "fractally precise" appears twice (once as "accuracy," once as "gradations"), creating a noticeable lexical loop. The phrasing "cipher of the cosmos" leans slightly purple, but the rhythm generally supports the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished and descriptive, with strong imagery like the "living inkblots," though it occasionally lapses into purple artifacts ("tuning a lute strung with sunbeams"). There is good information density, but some similes ("groaned like old bones") are cliché. The rhythmic control is solid, aiding the story's flow.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers severely from a repetitive "not X, but Y" sentence structure, which appears over ten times (e.g., "not with magic, but memory," "not to fix... but to understand," "not a beat, but a breath"). This template cadence creates a monotonous, sermon-like rhythm that stifles the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    While individual images are strong, the prose suffers from a severe repetitive rhetorical tic ("Not digital, not shouted"; "Not control, but catalysis"; "Not salvation... but summoned"; "Not distant, but waiting"). This "Not X, but Y" structure appears seven times, creating a predictable, lecturing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.9)
    A severe template cadence issue undermines the prose: the "not X, but Y" construction appears 12 times (e.g., "not to warn, but to cradle," "not in triumph, but in gratitude"). This repetitive artifact creates a droning rhythm that distracts from the imagery and dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bled orange into violet," "auditory breadcrumbs") and no scaffold artifacts. The sentence-level propulsion mirrors the urgency of the fading light while maintaining the character’s measured pace.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but metaphorical density occasionally strains credibility (e.g., bubbles, which snap or hiss, compared to booming "timpani"). The writing is generally dense and evocative, though it skirts the edge of purple prose in moments like "gilding the foam... liquid gold."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is polished but suffers from high metaphor density ("ledger bound in mist," "stylus of frozen breath") that clogs the narrative flow. The phrase "fingers, mindfully scattered" is a distracting physical image, likely a forced prompt inclusion that breaks anatomical logic. While rhythmically competent, the prose prioritizes poetic effect over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm and flow are strong, but the prose relies heavily on simile density ("like forgotten promises," "like tide-stranded jellyfish"), which occasionally creates distance. Some phrasing leans into cliché ("bruised twilight," "forgotten promises," "scars"), dampening the impact of the more original imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers severely from a repetitive "not X, but Y" sentence structure (used 8 times, e.g., "not a tool, but a talisman," "not in fear, but wonder"), which creates a monotonous, lecturing rhythm. This rhetorical crutch dominates the syntax and distracts from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe rhetorical artifact pervades the text: the "not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times ("not sky, but shards," "not to fix, but to modify"). This repetitive scaffolding creates a monotonous, lecturing rhythm that halts narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is polished and descriptive, with some striking images ("bat made of parchment"). However, the density of adjectives and "clandestinely luminous" repetition (forced by the prompt) creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of similes ("like dew-laden grass," "like cupped palms," "like frozen smoke") that clutters the narrative and stalls momentum. This "purple" overwriting draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene, violating the economy bias of the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely overwritten, with a high density of abstract metaphors and "purple" descriptors ("bruised violets," "anxious caress," "silent symphony") that obscure clarity. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings and mixed figurative language ("soil of difficulty," "ink faded but intent luminous") stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from figurative density; nearly every sentence relies on a simile or metaphor ("soft as a snowflake," "thick as tar," "braided silk"). This relentless ornamentation slows the narrative momentum and draws attention to the writing rather than the dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is competent but prone to overwriting and "purple" descriptors like "velvet scream" and "silent symphonies" that prize sound over clarity. The density of adjectives occasionally slows momentum, though the rhythm is generally controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is vivid ("mist pooled like liquid memory"), but the prose relies heavily on a repetitive negation structure ("Not X, but Y"; "Not a weapon... a seed"; "Not to fix... to listen"). This rhetorical tic appears frequently enough to become a noticeable artifact that stalls rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentence rhythm is generally strong, particularly in the opening. However, the prose is marred by the heavy cliché of the patch ("weighed more than it should") and some forced phrasing to accommodate required elements ("rapidly adapting"), which creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.8)
    A severe syntactic artifact dominates the prose: the construction "not [X], but [Y]" appears over 15 times, creating a monotonous, sermon-like cadence. This repetitive scaffolding acts as a crutch for definition and drains the narrative of rhythmic variety and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent but relies on several simile clichés ("silence fell like snow," "shadows pooled like spilled ink," "thin as spider silk"). "Avalanchingly" is an awkward adverbial construction that stumbles the opening rhythm, and the sentence structures in the middle section become somewhat repetitive ("She rose," "She lifted," "She stepped").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphorical density and "purple" tendencies (e.g., "whispered in tongues of fire and frost"). The reliance on tricolon lists ("a child's wonder, a soldier's hollow, a poet's rage") creates a repetitive rhythm that flattens the emotional impact into cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with dense adjectival strings and mixed metaphors ("ghost in her marrow"). While rhythmically sound, the reliance on high-calorie description ("sky bled violet," "thick as pollen") slows momentum without always adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.8)
    A pervasive template cadence flaw severely hampers the prose; the "not X, but Y" sentence construction appears over ten times (e.g., "not to escape, not to hide," "not distortion, but translation"). This repetitive scaffolding drains momentum and distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers heavily from "artifact" repetition; the distinctive phrase "stoically sparkling" appears three times, and "raveling silence" and "time's unraveling tapestry" also repeat verbatim. These loops draw attention to the writing mechanics and shatter the polish required for a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished but often overwritten ("vibrating at the frequency of half-remembered spells," "chapels of azure defiance"). These abstract metaphors reduce physical immediacy. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("silent kites," "jagged stone," "liquid twilight") slows the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally dense and vivid, but suffers from forced phrasing to accommodate prompt words; "cyclically spontaneous failure" creates a semantic clash that disrupts clarity. The borrowed "unbearable lightness" phrasing in the climax breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Polished sentence rhythm is marred by the significant continuity flaw regarding the sea glass's location. Phrasing occasionally slips into well-worn grooves ("echoing like heartbeats," "velvet dark"), reducing the freshness of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a severe "template cadence" artifact in the climax, utilizing the "Not X, but Y" rhetorical structure five times in close succession ("Not ships... but thresholds," "Not as nostalgia, but as sacrament"). This repetitive scaffolding flattens the rhythm and impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.5)
    Reliance on filter verbs ("She noticed," "She tracked," "She saw") and summary telling stifles scene momentum. The prose is dense with abstract noun phrases ("borrowed time," "science nor sorcery") that tell the reader the significance of the moment rather than allowing it to emerge through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a repetitive "not X, but Y" sentence structure used over a dozen times (e.g., "not with tools, but with patience," "not perfectly, not all at once," "not to wound, but to offer"), creating a distracting, algorithmic cadence. Additionally, there is an egregious editing error in the phrase "slick with rain-slicked parchment."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose rhythm is controlled and imagery is dense, though some metaphors feel precious ("pockets stuffed with... scent of rain") and standard personification ("mica shivered") reduces freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that clutters the line ("time thinning like old parchment," "creases resisting like scars"). Clichés like "moonlight pooled like liquid silver" and abstract phrasing ("breath cool against stained-glass") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is competent but suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally drifts into purple overwriting ("patience is the grammar of absolution," "crust hardened like old promises"). The prompt-mandated phrase "heuristically gentle" is integrated awkwardly. The rhythm is generally smooth, but the reliance on template cadence ("She [verb]... She [verb]") in the middle section flattens the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, successfully blending technical jargon ("Resonance Array") with lyrical imagery. However, occasional overwrought phrasing ("pendulum calibrated to reverence") and adjective-heavy descriptions prevent the highest marks for efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and mechanically clean with good density. A few metaphors strain credibility (a smile sharp enough to "fillet hope" mixes visual and abstract awkwardly), and the reliance on standard atmospheric descriptors prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose suffers from a repetitive "negative definition" syntactic artifact (using "Not X, but Y" or "Not X. Not Y. Z" structures). This construction appears at least seven times ("Not luminous in the way... but," "not of politicians, but of ecosystems," "Not divine, not alien, but," "Not north. Not destiny. Down," "not to touch him, but to," "not doubt, but trust," "not with fanfare, but with"). This creates a droning, sermon-like cadence that distracts from otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from noun/adjective stacking ("charcoal-fingered portrait sketch artist") and forced metaphors ("memories like tombstones"). The phrase "mnemonically sovereign" is a jarring artifact that disrupts the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative with strong rhythm and sensory density. There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("zinc-etched postal plate fragment," "shredded treasure map"), but the imagery is generally sharp and purposeful. The sentences propel the action forward effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from a severe, repetitive rhetorical artifact: the "not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times, creating a monotonous, didactic cadence. This template-based phrasing suffocates narrative momentum, while the reliance on abstract metaphor creates density without visual or causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive "not X, but Y" sentence scaffold (used ~8 times: "not as flaw but as anchor," "not suppression... but compression," "not programmed but grown," etc.). This repetitive structure creates a didactic, algorithmic rhythm that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished and readable but leans into sentimental abstraction ("whispered of a life interrupted," "locket... was grieving"). While flow is good, the reliance on scaffold phrases ("She didn’t... she collected...") and somewhat cliché similes prevents higher literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe syntactic artifact pervades the text: the "not X, but Y" construction appears roughly ten times (e.g., "not with urgency, but with," "not to flood, but to redirect," "not dead, not gone, but rewritten"). This repetitive template creates a lecturing, drumbeat cadence that distracts from the otherwise rich vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive "not X but Y" syntactic loop (five instances: "not from cold but from," "not sound, but pressure," "not pulling, but welcoming," etc.). This template cadence creates a rhythmic drone that dulls the otherwise high-density imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe syntactic repetition constitutes a fatal flaw; the "not X, but Y" construction is used over 15 times, creating an overwhelming template cadence. This artifacting renders the prose algorithmic and monotonous, destroying momentum and reading like a list of aphorisms.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative, though it occasionally leans into adjective density ("wrought-iron," "fleeting silver"). The verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "patiently nimble" in the climax creates a slight mechanical echo that feels like a scaffold rather than an organic refrain. However, the rhythm and imagery ("riddles wrapped in facts") are largely excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive overwriting and mixed metaphors ("petals that sighed like forgotten lullabies," "salt-tongued secrets") obscure clarity and stall momentum. The density of adjective-noun pairings and abstract phrasing ("geometries of grief") violates the standard for concrete, propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from adjectival clutter and visible prompt-scaffolding. Phrases like "calibrated treason" and "wisely enduring" are repeated verbatim to the point of distraction, and the rhythmic repetition of "as stalactites drip" feels more like a mechanical template than an organic pacing device.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and evocative word choice, creating a smooth read-aloud experience. However, the reliance on dense metaphorical abstraction sometimes obscures concrete action, and the forced insertion of prompt phrases results in awkward "telling" rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished with high-quality imagery ("slumped, dreamlike smear"), though occasional expository scaffolding ("that’s what the ghost whisperer calls them") creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose relies heavily on a repetitive "not X, but Y" syntactic template (used over 10 times: "not to chase light, but to listen," "not a blade, not a book, but a tool," etc.), creating a monotonous, algorithmic rhythm. Additionally, clunky adverbs and oxymorons ("scintillatingly somber") clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but marred by distinct artifacts, including a repetition error ("reassembling them... by reassembling shredded letters") in the same sentence. Sentence structures in action beats become repetitive ("She paused," "She knelt," "She stood"), and filter verbs ("intuiting," "watching") distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose is hampered by a high density of clichés ("thunder growled like a caged beast," "origami wings") and strained metaphors that obscure the action. The writing prioritizes poetic sounding-phrases over clarity and momentum, resulting in a text that feels "written" rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic ("Dawn’s earliest whistle"), creating a strong textural feel. However, there is a tendency toward adjective-heavy phrasing ("fragile, trembling things," "sonic reliquaries") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.0)
    A pervasive "template cadence" artifact severely mars the prose: the "not X, but Y" structure appears over ten times ("not to conquer... but to converse," "not with voice, but with vibration," "not control, but consonance"). This algorithmic repetition creates a monotonous rhythm that distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    A severe stylistic artifact dominates the prose: the "not X, but Y" sentence structure appears over 14 times ("not for refuge but for reckoning," "not conquest... but a patient revolution," etc.). This repetitive rhetorical looping creates a monotonous, formulaic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Strong sensory density is occasionally undercut by purple phrasing ("data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma") that tells rather than shows. The line-level craft is generally competent, but the tendency toward summarization and aphorism flattens the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("miniature cathedral of cogs"). Rhythm is controlled and varied. A few images lean slightly toward the conventional ("storm clouds bruised the sky"), but the overall execution is lyrical and precise, matching the story's subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the imagery is dense, the prose suffers from "writerly" abstractions ("older than regret") and internet-adjacent clichés ("duct tape and spite") that clash with the literary aspiration. The reliance on sentence fragments ("Not loud. Not sweet.") creates a staccato rhythm that feels stylized but repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing sentence fragments and anaphora effectively to build tension ("Not randomly. Recurring."). The description of digital decay ("unraveled into the substrate") is particularly strong. Line-level craft is polished, with no significant artifacts or drag.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    A severe repetitive artifact dominates the prose: the rhetorical structure "not X, but Y" is used over ten times (e.g., "not law, not order, but," "not magical... but," "not to fix... but"). This creates a predictable, lecturing cadence that destroys narrative momentum and reads like a scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from debilitating syntactic monotony; the pervasive overuse of the "not [X], but [Y]" structure (13+ instances) creates a drumbeat rhythm that flattens the narrative texture. Additionally, the density of similes ("like old bones," "like silt," "like a ghost's breath") occasionally drifts into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is competent but marred by register drift ("intersubjective understanding" is jarringly academic) and heavy-handed figurative language ("leaves skittered like secrets"). The text relies on "scaffolding" phrases ("He drew a parallel...") that explain the rhetorical moves instead of letting them play out organically.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.4)
    The prose is marred by the clumsy, triple repetition of the phrase "strangely honest" (concession, duality, act), which reads as a forced insertion of a prompt element. The text relies too heavily on abstract nouns and adjectival stacking ("whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion," "shifting dunes").

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting ("hummed hymns to resilience," "slicing twilight into ribbons") that prioritizes poetic posture over clarity. Abstract phrasing ("sorrow into symmetry") frequently obscures concrete action and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive syntactic monotony severely harms the prose; the "not [X], but [Y]" construction is used over ten times, creating a predictable, drumbeat cadence that flattens narrative momentum. This repetitive artifact dominates the text.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Momentum is generally good, but the prose suffers from stock phrasing ("scent of ozone and taste of static," "three heartbeats") and some overwriting ("tore open the air"). The reliance on abstract nouns to carry weight ("profound beauty," "sorrow") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from a severe, repetitive rhetorical artifact: the "Not X, but Y" structure appears over ten times ("not seismic, but existential"; "not with gears, but by sound"; "not to flee, but to transcend"). This template cadence creates a lecturing rhythm that stifles narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is overwritten and heavily reliant on "not X, but Y" rhetorical structures (five instances: "not ghosts but guests," "not grand requiems... but the ordinary," etc.). Mixed metaphors ("scent of hope... like honey on warm toast") and adjective clusters clutter the text and reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong information density ("cobalt, then gold, then black"). While occasional phrases border on purple ("whispers that slithered"), the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose relies on standard poeticisms ("like a shard of moonlight," "tasted of salt and honey") and adjective-adverb telling ("shrewdly innocent"). Sentence fragments ("Vines stirred. Petals shivered.") create a stilted rhythm that feels like an artifact of the style rather than a purposeful cadence. The density of abstract metaphor frequently obscures the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.5)
    Heavy repetitive artifacts severely mar the prose quality. The "not X, but Y" sentence template appears in nearly every paragraph, and specific phrases like "memories resurfaced" and "reflectively vibrant" are looped without variation, creating a draft-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant lexical repetition ("honeyed" appears three times); the ungrammatical insertion of "quietly proactive" and reliance on abstract filtering verbs lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. The score is held back by a high density of similes (five "like" constructions in key descriptions) and some purple phrasing ("marrow of her syntax") that verges on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    A severe stylistic artifact ("not [X], but [Y]") appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not fables, but truths," "not in warning, but in solidarity"), creating a repetitive, template-like rhythm that deadens the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory verbs. A few phrases lean on cliché ("killing cold," "joints creaking like old timber") or slightly overuse metaphorical filtering ("as if asking permission"), but the overall line-level craft is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is dense and polished but suffers from "purple" overwriting, relying heavily on similes ("clung like regret," "pooled like mercury," "tasted like cinnamon"). These frequent figurative turns draw attention to the writing itself rather than the scene, creating a barrier to immersion. The line "physics wearing poetry's coat" reads as meta-commentary that breaks the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    Simile density is excessive (~13 instances), creating a persistent syntactic loop that distances the reader ("like drowned fireflies," "like thin ice," "like a cave-in," "like seashell whorls"). This reliance on comparison over direct assertion dilutes the scene's immediacy and triggers the Patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of figurative language that feels decorative (e.g., "rust-hued peace," "shrill punctuation," "stripe her hands with watery gold"). While competent, the reliance on adjective-heavy description and similes slows the momentum and feels "writerly" rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery. However, there is a tendency toward metaphor stacking ("laughter calcified," "sighs fossilized") which creates density artifacts that occasionally slow momentum in favor of ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is generally solid with some strong verbs ("cannibalized," "threaded"), but the inclusion of the literal mathematical formula disrupts the prose texture. The reliance on abstract summaries of action ("maze of intentions") lowers the information density of the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from an overwhelming reliance on a specific syntactic scaffold (&quot;not X, but Y&quot;), which appears over a dozen times (e.g., &quot;not absence, but presence,&quot; &quot;not storm, but sigh,&quot; &quot;not a place, but an object&quot;). This creates a monotonous drumbeat that distracts from the imagery. Additionally, the density of similes borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    A severe stylistic artifact dominates the prose: the "Not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times ("Not for treasure, nor fame, but to..."; "not to hunt, but to listen"; "not magic, not fate, but physics"). This repetitive template cadence kills narrative momentum and creates a monotonous, chanting rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    While rhythm is controlled, the prose suffers from purple phrasing ("sleeping serpent of wisdom") and distinct clichés ("gnarled like driftwood"). The repetition of "infinitely patient" acts as a scaffold loop rather than a reinforced motif.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is dense with metaphor and adjective stacking ("bruised twilight," "quiet elegy," "hollows in the soul"). This overwriting creates a "purple" texture that obscures the action. Several abstract metaphors ("stitching grief into grammar") compete for space, reducing clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    While imagery is often rich, the climax suffers from a severe template-cadence artifact: the "not X, but Y" construction is used eight times in close succession. This repetitive syntax flattens the rhythm of the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive imagery ("tide-pulled kelp" and "kelp-drift" in the first paragraph) and an overuse of the "Not X, but Y" syntactic structure. These stylistic artifacts create a predictable cadence that dampens the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    A severe template-cadence artifact dominates the prose: the "Not [A], but [B]" construction appears nine times in a short piece (e.g., "Not conquest, nor discovery," "Not flour... but glimmers," "Not glow, but clarity," "Not ghosts, but memories"). This rhetorical crutch strangles the sentence rhythm and reduces the narrative to a list of definitions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the vocabulary is rich, the prose suffers from significant flaws: a loop in the first sentence ("petals... falling petals") and the pervasive "not X, but Y" template cadence. These artifacts clutter the rhythm and distract from the otherwise polished imagery, failing the "flawless" standard.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    While grammatically polished, the prose is frequently overwritten and relies on dense, stacked metaphors ("unspooling like a sigh," "bruised hues") that border on purple. The density of figurative language sometimes obscures the immediate action, and phrases like "thundering calm" feel like forced paradoxes rather than precise descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often dense and adjectival ("searing reverie," "liquid night"), bordering on overwrought. Phrases like "ethically diligent hands" and "micro-script" clash tonally with the archaic/mythic setting, creating jarring register slips that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    A severe repetitive rhetorical artifact—the "Not X, but Y" sentence structure—appears seven times (e.g., "Not with scissors... but by decoding," "Not from sadness, but from recognition"), creating a didactic, drumming template cadence that distracts significantly from the otherwise high-density prose.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract metaphors ("silence thick with latent futures," "tectonic thought"), which slows momentum and muddles clarity. The heavy adjectival stacking often suffocates the physical action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetitive sentence artifacting damages the rhythm; over 10 sentences begin with "She [verb]" (She scrambled, She watched, She began, She learned, She mapped, She froze, She understood, She sang, She cloaked). This template cadence persists through the closure, creating a monotonous list-like effect.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from "simile churn," relying heavily on a repetitive "verb like noun" structure ("like frozen screams," "like pigment," "like negative space," "like smoke," "like snowfall," "like a metronome"). This scaffolding becomes noticeable and distracts from the image, while phrases like "frozen screams" lean into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but leans on abstract adjectival pairings ("abrasive calm," "latent precision," "calibrated silence") that weaken imagery. While the rhythm is good, these "tell" phrases dilute the impact of the stronger, concrete details like the drowned stars.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from cliché metaphors ("leaves like burnt parchment," "tuned wood to weep") and prompt-driven repetition (the word "denote" appears three times, "expectantly resigned" twice). These artifacts feel mechanical and disrupt the otherwise smooth cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and readable but suffers from repetitive sentence structures (subject-opener cadence: "She began," "She swallowed," "She cleared," "She sat back"). This rhythmic monotony flattens the momentum, giving the action a list-like quality despite the rich vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative ("truth spilled out of him like sap"). The imagery is specific and active. While some phrases border on the ornate ("cartographer mapping ghosts"), the line-level craft generally propels the story efficiently and establishes a strong aesthetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe rhythmic artifact pervades the text: the "not [X], but [Y]" construction appears over 12 times ("not metaphorically, but...", "not because... but because...", "not silence, but...", "not fire, but..."). This template cadence dominates the prose, reducing the narrative to a repetitive list of negations and assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent but overwrought, relying on dense adjectival strings and mixed metaphors ("scalpel dipped in honey," "dissolving like sugar in tea"). The reliance on similes in high-pressure beats dampens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has strong rhythm ("metronome of regret"), but suffers from awkward phrasing to accommodate the prompt ("moved balancedly daring" is jarring). Some descriptions border on purple ("scream in the shape of absence").

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("moon-tipped," "saffron quiet," "smog-throttled") that create a static, ornamental rhythm. While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on dense figurative language slows momentum and occasionally borders on purple ("pooled like spilled ink").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and imaginative ("mnemonic architecture," "rosewater dread"), though it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("kneaded with lavender and grief"). The rhythm is controlled, and the imagery is generally distinct and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is often overwritten, relying on dense stacks of personification ("sea retreated like a sigh," "tide holding its breath") and clichés ("paradox coiled... like smoke"). The repeated use of the prompt phrase "neatly inventive" feels like a forced insertion rather than a natural descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose relies on a repetitive "like [noun]" simile structure ("like grease," "like a femur," "like sugar"), creating a rhythmic loop. Additionally, the "film negative" metaphor clashes logically with the "pixel by pixel" dissolution, breaking the analog consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from extreme template cadence artifacts. The "not [noun/verb], but [noun/verb]" construction appears in nearly every paragraph and touches the closure beat, destroying syntactic variety and momentum. This repetitive scaffolding distracts significantly from the otherwise rich vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong with distinct imagery ("spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs"), but suffers from occasional weak diction ("magically unrust" clashes with the formal tone). There is a tendency toward adjective-heavy description ("electric certainty") that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed or heavy metaphors ("veins of forgotten time," "pit of lies," "archives could bleed," "sigh of ivy"). The high density of adjectives and figurative language slows momentum and obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is generally polished, there are distinct flaws that mar the "flawless" standard. A significant editing oversight occurs with the tautological phrase "chisel for chiseling meaning," and the repetition of "resolve" (paragraph 1 and near the end) feels less like a motif and more like a lexical loop. The reliance on adjective-heavy description slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but leans toward purple abstractions ("shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts") and declarative summarization of internal states. Information density is good, but the "prompt-check" sentence structures create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story relies heavily on a single syntactic structure ("not [X], but [Y]"), which appears over 15 times (e.g., "not for beauty, but to capture," "not magic, but mechanics," "not up, but down"). This creates a monotonous, chant-like cadence that constitutes a significant stylistic artifact and distracts from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose momentum is strong and density is high, though metaphors like "wound turning in its sleep" and "trauma-tuned nerves" occasionally verge on purple melodrama. The required phrase "intangibly tangible" feels slightly forced within the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    A severe syntactic tic pervades the text: the construction "not [A], but [B]" appears approximately nine times (e.g., "not by danger, but by beauty," "not with resistance, but relief," "not from fear, but awe"). This creates a monotonous template cadence that creates a mechanical rhythm and distracts from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    The text relies excessively on a "not X, but Y" sentence structure (e.g., "Not abandonment. Sacrifice."; "Not to deceive. Not to escape."; "not sieved, but settled"), which appears over a dozen times. This pervasive template cadence creates a droning rhythm that flattens the prose and severely distracts from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and strained mixed metaphors ("furrowed hush," "turn the lead of loss"). The explanatory aside regarding the moon phases ("not literally... but metaphorically") breaks immersion and highlights a lack of trust in the imagery’s ability to stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from high-density overwriting and strained similes (e.g., "salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations"). The relentless figurative language ("magnetized the air," "steer her own pulse") clogs the narrative momentum and obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from a pervasive template cadence artifact: the "not [X], but [Y]" structure appears over a dozen times ("not stone... but ink," "not to pray, but to listen," "not guilt... but a raw"). This rhetorical tic creates a monotonous rhythm that distracts significantly from the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwhelmed by a repetitive syntactic template: negation followed by affirmation ("not grief, nor vengeance, but..."; "not fear, not excitement, but..."; "not by force, but by faith"). This "template cadence" artifact appears in nearly every paragraph, destroying narrative momentum and reducing the prose to a predictable formula. It signals a lack of syntactic control.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a severe, repetitive syntactic artifact: the "not X, but Y" construction appears approximately twelve times (e.g., "not of a child, but of silence," "not for sin, but for surrender"). This excessive repetition creates a drumbeat cadence that distracts from the imagery and stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("crystallized into light," "refracted not memory but possibility"), risking purple patches. The explicit naming of the psychological concept ("shadow work") within the narrative flow breaks the spell, reading more like an explanation than a story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but oversaturated with similes (time like taffy, mist like cats, dissolving like sugar, rumbled like a purr, stars like fish), creating density without propulsion. Several images veer into cliché ("syllables only cracked hearts could hear"), and the rhythm becomes repetitive during the cataloging of the releases.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows well but suffers from adjective density and mixed metaphors ("sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies") that feel like stock phrasing. The reliance on "telling" via explanatory clauses slows momentum during what should be a high-tension sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is marred by an excessive reliance on the "not X, but Y" sentence structure (used over 10 times: "not metaphorically... but physically," "not swimming, but gliding," "not to control... but to align"). This creates a monotonous, template-like cadence that distracts from the otherwise rich imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density ("metronome to memory," "cartography of wounds," "oracle of ink") that occasionally slows momentum. The required phrase "storm-kissed wonder" feels slightly ornamental. Rhythm is good, but adjectival heaviness drags slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is polished but suffers from pathetic fallacy ("brook gurgled approvingly") and adjectival clutter ("prismatic shards," "silent herald"). Key prompt phrases ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos") are inserted as static labels rather than demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from simile density, with a figurative comparison appearing in nearly every beat ("sharp as a snapped pencil," "stuck like burrs," "cracking like old floorboards"). This reliance on scaffolding weakens the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("silver-barked," "petrified driftwood," "wistful station pianist"), slowing momentum. Clichéd descriptions like "a chord that didn't exist in any known scale" rely on tropes rather than specific musical or sensory detail to convey the impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally dense with adjectival modification ("luminous and sharp," "star-drunk"). The sentence rhythm supports the ritualistic nature of the scene, and the line-level logic remains clear despite the abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose suffers from simile density (9+ "like/as" constructions), which creates a "poetic fog" that distances the reader from the immediate action. Phrases like "smoothing the ruffled edges of time" border on purple overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with purposeful figurative pattern (resonance trails, fractal mandalas) taught early, pays off in visible helix without muddle. Rhythm varies (short strikes amid long swells); no loops or scaffolds dull climax. Minor overwriting in fractal descriptors doesn't obscure sea-thickening cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("smoke," "failed lungs," "electric certainty") in dawn test para overwrites subtle pressure slightly but stays voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with varied syntax propels from moss-brushing to petal drop; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Minor synonym churn on "lie" variants but thematic, not looping. Read-aloud rhythm charges closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, propelling accumulation; consistent water/entropy metaphors avoid muddle, though opening density risks slight overwrite before tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density integrates sensory propulsion ("fingers brushing... spines," "click... echoing like a vow") with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite lyric figuration—pattern-taught and purposeful. Paragraph cuts test passes: each advances texture or charge. Minor elevated diction fits voice without peak drift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm varies with scene (short dirge lines at climax), high density advances all layers without loops, though minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite (−0.3). Propulsion clear, closure chord image unblurred. No scaffold; purposeful metaphors consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)

    High density with propulsion (e.g., "watch hand spasmed, its ticking accelerating"); figurative pattern (hush/sieving) taught without muddle, minor density slip in peak memory beat caps from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion (e.g., "She synchronized her breaths... gibbous"); minor metaphor density in reflections (-0.3) but no muddle or loops touching closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no scaffold, clean syntax emphasizes relics ("cold and heavy").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "salt wind tangling... unresolved equations"); varied rhythm passes ear test, minor opening metaphor stack purposeful for voice but borders overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "branching fractals") coherent without muddle. Minor density in opening reflection but no loops or scaffolds dulling peak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload in transformation beat ("smoke serpents... lift," "ember-feathers") risks coherence without pattern payoff, docking peak propulsion; minor "not X, but Y" loops purposeful yet templated.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    High density with varied rhythm propels without loops; coherent metaphors like "time curled like smoke" avoid muddle in visions beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors ("needle-fine intent," "grams of levity per heartbeat"); minor figurative density in setup beats doesn't obscure, but elevated diction borders register drift in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; figurative coherence (e.g., bugs pulsing with celestials) taught early without muddle in peak releases. Minor density in metaphors contained, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative stack in courtyard ("sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies") slightly overwrites pressure beat, docking from peak without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    High density with purposeful figuratives ("living mandala," "collapsed star dust") taught via sequences, no loops; propulsion peaks in touchless contact flooding memories.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion; varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Figurative coherence (storm/scars/quartz) pattern-taught, but minor overwrite density in peak beats ("lightning forked... illuminating envelope") risks muddle. No loops; clean grammar. Slight purple edges dull final image propulsion minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory propulsion; opening metaphor density ("prismatic shards," "siege engine") enriches without muddling climax alignment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in ending ("liquid starlight," "open ribs") coherent via molting pattern, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of singing absorbing into rust.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddle, as "a sound woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing" integrates figurative peak seamlessly into closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion (e.g., vines "threaded with glyphs that flickered like fireflies caught in amber" advances memory stakes); figurative consistency in lyric mode avoids muddle, but minor density overload in opening ridge description slightly slows initial momentum—no loops or artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in purposeful figures like "blue as silence after a slammed door"; minor density overload in peak ritual (air thickens, color gradients) slightly dulls propulsion but pattern holds without loops.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences layer job and texture—information density is high without purple drift. One scaffold trace: “she wept then, not from sorrow, but kindled humility” edges toward label, but the next clause grounds it. Rhythm accelerates from tweezers to aurora without loops clogging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence openings avoid drumbeat. Metaphors stay physically coherent (frost = galaxy arms, ledger = map) and serve information density. Zero paraphrase loops, no synonym churn. One mixed image—“luminous glass artist” (literal) vs. “luminous” prose—could tighten, but does not blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density high: one sentence often sets glass, temperature, and emotional valence. Figurative language is selective—“snowflakes hovered like paused notes”—and never stacks in high-pressure beats. One scaffold detected: “not metaphor, not memory, but actual, resonant harmony” is a triplet that could lose middle clause; minor, does not touch closure. Rhythm breathes: long sentence of dawn ascent followed by one-line finality. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure—sentence length swells then fractures like glass. Figurative language is selective: “frozen lightning,” “cathedral ribs.” One scaffold loop: “he couldn’t bury it. Couldn’t ignore it.”—but the anaphora serves the beat. No mixed metaphors; diction stays within undertaker’s lexicon. Final image is lean, letting the amber pulse carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory cue, stakes reminder, and object state. Figurative language is spare but precise (“frost feathered the ridge”) and never clusters in peak beats. Opening and closing lines are image-anchors, not filler; punctuation and tense immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm modulates like lung tides: long anapestic rolls for exhale, fragment bursts for inhale. Metaphors are internally coherent—tear as liquid starlight, mist as lullaby—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often sets bloom, tool, emotion, myth. Only minor scaffold: “she inhaled slowly, exhaled—” repeated root, but it is pattern-taught and pays off in permeation. No loops or synonym churn in closing beat; final line is clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short shocks (“Not burned. / Not torn.”) to sinuous coils that mimic hyperbolic curves. No scaffold or synonym loops; each metaphor extends the tactile premise. One mixed moment—“bruised violet” sky might clash with later prismatic light—but the halo’s fracture justifies spectral range. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like the fragment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “She pressed the piano keys gently, one by one, letting each note linger like a promise” advances action, atmosphere, and stakes. No synonym loops or scaffold; each metaphor is singular and apt. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Zero artifacts in final third; clarity never blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative density is high yet purposeful: each metaphor extends the synesthetic rule-set rather than decorating it. Occasional stacked modifiers—“memory-dust,” “phosphorescent algae”—risk purple but are justified by the lyric accumulative mode. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. One clause drifts toward abstraction (“alchemy of grief turned into guidance”) but is anchored by the tactile packing of tools that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high: single sentences deliver atmosphere, backstory, and motion (“Tonight, though, she carried no camera…”) without padding. Figurative language is patterned—moonbeam as liquid mercury, destiny’s door—each reappears to charge closure. No synonym churn or scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are crisp. A lone mixed metaphor (“shadows pooled like spilled ink” under an archway) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences do more than one job: “She fed it scrap metal and broken tools, fueling transformation with abandonment” advances action, metaphor, and theme. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for ritual, abrupt cuts for departure. Only micro-flaw: occasional modifier stacks (“brittle air as ice whispered its retreat”) approach purple, but they fit her dramatic register and never obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layers ("celluloid curling like a dying snake") are selective, never crowding a single beat. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed micro-metaphor—"constellations older than lies" beside "rusted library groaned"—barely grazes coherence, keeping the 9 band in sight but not quite secured.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost every sentence carries dual duty (image + motion, sound + memory); no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor density clot in the lightning-flash / delayed-roar line is forgivable and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold or synonym loops; each sentence adds pattern or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“metronome counting silence”) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; ice metaphors stay coherent. Final droplet line is crisp, propulsive, earns resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative runs frequent but serve image-accumulation design; mixed metaphors minor (“liquid stars” beside “flint eyes”) yet physically coherent. No paraphrase loops; minor scaffold in “silence that had settled since words became unnecessary.” Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts tight. Lens crack at closure is taut; earlier density slightly dilutes mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence adds new texture or knowledge. Metaphors stay physically coherent—moonflower against frost, wisteria “heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness.” Information density is high: “She polished a deep-blue sphere webbed with hairline fractures, murmuring to the jasmine overhead: ‘You remember...’” does four jobs in one breath. Even the em-dash cadences serve elder breath-control, never obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative control is disciplined—“light peeled like onion” is the only metaphor, paid off by lateral folds. High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, technical, and emotional data. Minor scaffold: “mechanically warm” is reused four times; trimming one instance would lift to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo of clauses, then caesura of fragments. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor (chairs like lily pads, chandeliers drowned) stays within physical logic. One hairline slip—“black mouth swallowing moonlight”—edges toward purple but is earned by gothic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences are dense but propulsive—“snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret” compresses sensation and metaphor without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop: “silence was a glacier—slow, crushing, inevitable” restates the oracle’s earlier gravity metaphor. Figurative muddle avoided; auroral sorrow is minted once and left to resonate. No artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. “Dust falling… like silent applause” is precise, non-generic metaphor that recharges motif. Sentence rhythm mirrors descent—longer clauses approaching valve, clipped fragments at recognition. No mixed metaphors, no register drift; technical details (3:17 timestamp, transistor corrosion) are accurate and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Density is high—every sentence layers image and concept—but figurative language is patterned early ("silence...a living membrane") and therefore reads as voice, not overwrite. No mixed metaphors; each vehicle extends the entropy-as-dance conceit. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences build pressure, then fragment at climax ("Seasons would turn. / Shelves would collapse."). Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory or conceptual particle. Copy clean except one comma splice in "Forests grew teeth and swallowed cities; oceans learned to walk..." which reads intentional to create catalogue momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; sentences carry dual duty (image + motion). Minor metaphor clustering in opening 100 w but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift. Read-aloud cadence varies; closing hush lands cleanly. Information density high for word count.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences often twin sensory fact with metaphysical punch—“ash still clung like regret.” Metaphors are internally coherent (autopsy ribs, seismograph hands) and don’t stack in pressure beats. No loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and concept; final line recharges “smile” motif with inversion. Minor register lift (“Conceptual Repricing”) is earned by cumulative mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; paragraph cuts tight. Figurative control: “beam slicing dark like conductor’s baton” extends without mixed-metaphor spill. Zero loops, no synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“existentially”) fits Elias’s outsider bard persona; no register drift under peak beat. Clean grammar, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is virtuosic: every sentence advances atmosphere or ontology; no filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Metaphors interlock—stillness as architecture, silence as pigment—without mixed logic. Read-aloud cadence breathes with priest’s ritual tempo; paragraph cuts land on spatial warps. One hairline: "time hiccuped" is a cliché-bundle in an otherwise coinage-rich field; it nicks the closure beat but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical; sentence length modulates like dynamics. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor is single-use and precise: “stars like trapped breath.” Information density is high—every line carries image + motion + emotional valence. Minor purple flourish “upturned hush” is forgiven because the piece teaches its own diction. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence length varies, no template cadence. Information density high—one line can world-build and escalate: “Runes flared: not carved, but grown.” No mixed metaphors; root/vein/branch motif stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “she stepped…the floor dissolved…she climbed” uses three identical openers in seven lines—−0.2. No artifacts touch closure beat; final “liquid starlight” is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence advances image, stakes, or cadence. No loops or scaffold; metaphor chain (ribs, bellies, scalpel) stays coherent. Opening line anchors voice and sensory path. Minor mixed metaphor—“filament of hush that could stitch fractured minds”—but repaired by tangible needle act.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean, no synonym loops; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“whisper of wrongness” evokes static without purple stretch. Rhythm varies: longer reflective sentences butt against staccato decisions, supporting momentum. One mixed metaphor—“static before a rogue quarantine zone activates”—is minor and does not tangle causality or dull the closure image, so stays within 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level density excellent: glass/ghost/vanish/vial compression never loops; each phrase layers scent-light-memory. Metaphor vehicles (frozen tears, cathedral, loyal hound) cohere to glass-and-light motif. Rhythm modulates—clause lengthening under perfume rush, fragment sparks under UV. Zero filter-verb stacks; punctuation clean; final image “last crystal shadow trailing” lands without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences layer sensory + metaphysical jobs—“fibers whispering of panic and grit” compresses sound, touch, backstory. No paraphrase loops; each spiral, kiss, pulse adds new information. Metaphors stay internally coherent (heat over desert stone). Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing; no scaffold. Minor: “ethically playful” appears twice; second instance could cut, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor carries dual duty (“ash over every leafless ridge” = sight + grief). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Information dense: one line can set scene, reveal tool, and tilt emotion. Final line trades on earlier “unfinished” motif, no clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without purple drift. Occasional elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing” zone) flirt with register drift but stay justified by the perfumer-scientist substrate. Zero loops or scaffold; pronoun tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—description and moral arithmetic. One loop: “again in silence, again with care” repeats the cadence of earlier deliveries without fresh texture. Metaphors of tides and seasons stay coherent, but the harbor symphony metaphor vanishes after the opening, leaving faint structural echo.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Generally high density, but occasional stacked metaphors (“murmur of lost languages,” “crystalline orchard glowed—trees of faceted quartz humming with trapped starlight”) flirt with overwriting in tight space. No loops or scaffold; transitions are clean. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve with imagetic punch. Minor register drift toward poetic inventory keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “uncaging moments—not freeing them, but releasing them from stasis” performs three jobs (define verb, foreshadow cost, sculpt metaphor). No mixed metaphors; mercury image stays coherent inside acoustic logic. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for giant exhale, then staccato “It worked.” Proofreading clean; only nit is hyphen inconsistency in “saber-toothed.”

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear is near-flawless: sentence lengths swell and contract like lungfuls of cave air. Only micro-loop flagged: “dovetail” used three times in 50 words—just shy of artifact threshold. One mixed metaphor—“droplets...like metronomes counting down to nothing”—survives because it externalizes the story’s own countdown logic. Density is high; every sentence carries image + concept + emotional increment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm flexes with breath and dust, no template cadence. Sentences multi-task: “She cradled it, not as salvage, but as sacrament” advances action, metaphor, and moral stance. Figurative language is sparse, never muddled; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops/scaffold; high density. Only a single “slow erosion of soul” nears therapy-speak but is rescued by embodied context.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines (“veins glowing gold like liquid circuitry”) advance both image and stakes; no synonym loops. One mixed metaphor—“synapse mid-thought”—minor, doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence carries at least two jobs (image + interior, setting + myth). Metaphors are concrete and consistent—“cathedral arches,” “librarian of loss”—without purple inflation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“seaglass shard… glowing faintly gold”) that recharges prior amber motif. Read-aloud rhythm is tidal, never monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long hypnotic clauses during cave’s song, staccato fragments at reveal. Information density high—one sentence often does description + interior + foreshadowing (“She hadn’t intended to use it. / Not yet.”). No loops or mixed metaphors; “overlapping shadows” stays consistent. Closure line “The cave sang on” is spare, resonant, unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; no mixed metaphors; every sentence carries dual duty (image + data). “Ivory harbor gleamed under a bruised sky” opens with sonic snap and instant anchoring. Figurative density is patterned early—storm/bruised, salt/prayer—so later returns feel earned, not stacked. Final line’s “sail through silence” is crystal, no artifact touch.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density without scaffold: single sentences fold time and metaphor—“air hummed with withheld confessions.” Varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat; paragraphs shrink at door-beat to accelerate breath. Figurative logic remains internally coherent—starlight pools, cracks bloom—no mixed vehicles. Minor paraphrase on “cracks…arrows” (three repeats) clips 0.2, insufficient to cloud closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density without clutter—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors (“salt winds that carried the distant songs of migrating whales”) remain physically coherent; whales as cello bow is fresh yet apt. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“leaving the magic square tile pulsing softly…faithfully—for the next trembling hand”). Minor elevated register in “emotional harmonics” is earned by prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exemplary: high information density, no loops or scaffold, metaphors are coherent and physics-consistent. Sentence rhythms swell and contract with magnetic storm beats. One mixed-metaphor risk—“whips of ionized regret”—is acceptable within sustained lyric mode. No artifacts appear in final third; closure image is crystal. Meets 9+ quick test for technical cleanliness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    High-density lines: stainless tray/embodied chill/ink obsidian triple duty—setting, character, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds pressure or sensory charge. Metaphors stay coherent (ink as tea-dissolving sugar) and physically grounded. Final paragraph cadence slows to match exhalation of new covenant—no figurative muddle under peak image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with ascent—long sentences for climb, staccato for discovery. No loops; each sentence adds density or new sensory angle. Figurative language is selective: “time’s quilt” appears once and is immediately grounded by tactile “stitch.” One mixed metaphor (“blooming labyrinth”) is licensed by bonsai horticulture. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously; final line resolves by image that recharges lamp and trees as co-conspirators. Information density high—e.g., “graphite ghosts of eras that never were but felt truer than fact” does triple duty.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; high-density lines (“songs without composers, tragedies without witnesses”) advance atmosphere without purple drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“quilt of whispers against cold machinery”) is earned by prior layering pattern and does not dull closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic variation propels: long breathless sentences for crowd flow, staccato fragments for evictions. Metaphors are coherent—Ferris wheel morphing into logo—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can layer wind direction, stall placement, and social cue. Only micro-loop: “reorganizes…reorganize” in adjacent sentences; minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or technical data. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“shadows swallowed machinery and memory alike.” Register stays within a trained technician’s lexicon. The one-line label is a perfect micro-burst of closure without syntactic flab.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, tool action, and time cue (“anchor’s groan…pooled beneath her bare feet”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (light as tide). Minor perfume in “iron bones slick with dew” but it’s earned by POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variation is musical; no template cadence detected. Metaphors stay consistent (ice as ship, condensation as delta) without mixed logic. High density—“editing out empires to reveal aquifers” does three jobs. Minor scaffold: “quiet bloom / quiet certainty / quiet pact” triplet is deliberate echo rather than churn; it tightens rather than loops, so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short percussive heel-strikes to long rolling clauses that mimic echo-decay; no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple overload yet precise—“vibration traveled up her arm like a root seeking water”—and never muddies causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm mirrors breath: longer clauses when hush deepens, fragments at oxygen panic. Figurative language is selective—“velvet quiet,” “constellations” in glass—never clutters beats. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One mixed-metaphor risk: “velvet quiet”/“symphony” shift is justified by conceptual repricing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from short gasps to long, light-laden clauses; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—metaphors of origami, shroud, breath—each serving the transformation of light into testimony. No mixed metaphors in the climactic beat. Minor scaffold: “the lattice… the lattice…” twice in close succession costs a tenth. Otherwise high-density, propulsive, and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    High figurative density is patterned early (“glass panes trembling under frost-laden winds”) and pays off in final fruit-rind etching, so no penalty. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends body-botanic fusion. One paraphrase hiccup: “never lingering long enough…always arriving precisely” could compress, but momentum survives. Closure image is razor-clean.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences braid concrete nouns and strong verbs: “thread curling like smoke,” “dust that tasted of forgotten hymns.” No looped stems or synonym churn; each image adds new pressure. Metaphors stay physically coherent within dream-logic. Occasional elevated lyricism is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is deliberate: cadence breathes with dusk-light and petal-fall, accelerating only during dig beats. Figurative density is high but patterned; mixed metaphors are avoided. Two micro-loops (“roots…roots”; “faith…faith”) are forgiveable echoes inside incantatory design. No scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; every clause advances image, pressure, or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence music is deliberate: anaphora of “Not if she could…” creates ritual pulse without template monotony. Figurative layering (“cathedral of lost connections”) is spare and earned, never floods a beat. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds timing or sensory nugget. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs—chalk, dust, dawn—without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is loom-steady yet varied; paragraph lengths visually echo tapestry bands. No filter-verb stacks; “she stitched” is active, never “she began to stitch.” One mixed metaphor—“shadows clawed up the cobalt walls”—is earned by flame distortion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal information. Information density is high: one sentence often layers celestial reference + emotional state + plot cue.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is musical, but metaphor density borders on purple in high-pressure beats (“branches curled around her wrists like curious hands”). No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors; spatial tracking perfect. Some template cadence in anaphora (“She didn’t… She didn’t…”) but serves ritual rhythm. Minor loop: “trembling” appears three times in close proximity; does not obscure causality but dulls final image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “brain coral fragment, its grooves still humming with ghost-pressure” does three jobs—object, metaphor, memory—in ten words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mist as breath, coral as calcified hope—no mixed vehicles. Final clause “lighter, not because the pain had vanished, but because she’d learned to carry it with grace” lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer job—image, motion, emotion—without scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“apples that would never rot” beside “breath on glass”) is minor. No loops, no template cadence; information density is high and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence propels—information often doubled (light → sound → scent) but always additive. Metaphors are acoustic, never mixed: “echoes folded into lullabies” obeys garden physics. Clarity perfect across time-sequence of ricochet. Read-aloud cadence mirrors tuning-fork decay—breath-lines at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information-dense lines (“gourd rattle seed tucked beneath her tongue, its hollow rattle a metronome for rebellion”) do triple duty: object, symbolism, rhythm. Only minor loop: “converging chaos” repeated twice early; not in closure. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay horticultural/insectile. Sentence cadence varies; no template drumbeat. A few adjectival stacks (“humid air thick with the static of monitored cognition”) read lush but purposeful for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varies naturally; sentence lengths wax and wane like tides. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—vehicles extend the marine/bloom field without mixed collisions. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or texture. High information density: “stanzas fossilizing into frescoes only crabs and octopuses could decipher” simultaneously advances setting, theme, and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “grief bound in vellum, joy pressed between glass” compresses museum rules into one line. No synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent—“slow tides of mercury” sustains cloud imagery. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she believed her”). Final paragraph propels with clause variation and clean sequence. Minor elevated register (“opal,” “auroral”) fits the lyric mode without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm varies: long breathless accumulations mirror rising chord, then short declaratives at release. No template cadence or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors avoided; “symphonies of truth” is literalized, not decorative. Minor scaffold: “she documented everything… dipping her quill…” could compress, but does not obscure causality or dull closure. High information density: one sentence often advances setting, stakes, and sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally high density, but occasional metaphor stacking (“caramel smear…bergamot and regret”) edges toward purple in a low-pressure beat. One paraphrase loop: “She trembled…She trembled again.” Otherwise syntax is varied, verbs muscular, no filter-verb clutter. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly. No artifact touches the harmonic closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, emotional, and causal—“she balanced the chip on the spine of a first edition Keats” advances experiment, reveals value hierarchy, and foreshadows fulcrum. Figurative density peaks only at the climax where it’s earned; earlier beats stay lean. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold. Final line (“The attic breathed”) is monosyllabic release after cascading clauses—rhythmic mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is high-density lyric: each sentence layers image, memory, and metaphysics without scaffold. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (mist as fingers, grief fossilized). Rhythm accelerates into the single-sentence final beat, mirroring dissipation. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “sacred geometry”—stays within Elara’s trained lexicon, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Density is high—most sentences double-duty atmosphere + motive. Figurative layering (aurora walls, cheerful gloom) remains coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “then” adverbial openings cluster in two lines, not enough to dull closure. Final line varies length for cadence lift. Clean grammar, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops dull the surf. Each sentence layers image and idea—“serenade monotony with creativity” compresses mission and music in five words. Metaphors stay coherent within saltwater physics. The only micro-loop is “remained…remained…remained” in the finale, but it is purposeful echo, not scaffold. Closure image is crystal, no artifact touches it.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density risks purple glare (“velvet hush of petals folding”) yet stays purposeful because every image services the accrual of pressure. No loops or synonym churn; sentences vary in length to mimic Choreographic phrasing. One mixed metaphor—“time bent like reeds in estuary winds”—barely grazes clarity but occurs pre-closure, so minor.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric density is high yet patterned; metaphor vehicles stay optical (refraction, spectral shards), preventing internal contradiction. Sentences vary in length and cadence; only minor scaffold—“the bay would wake soon, loud and brash and ordinary”—but it pays off the hush/ordinary tension, so artifact touches not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: most sentences carry image + interiority + motion. Figurative runs (“slow dance,” “reliquary for trembling truths”) risk purple but pattern taught early and repaid. No filter-verb stacks, loops, or synonym churn. Occasional elevated register (“lullaby for the scorched”) justified by lyric mode. Proofing clean; pronouns stable.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence does double duty (image + concept). Figurative language is patterned and controlled—“spirals within spirals” returns to charge the ending. One mixed metaphor risk (“silk scarves in slow wind”) but it recurs intentionally, anchoring the textile motif. No loops or scaffold; prop states (gauge needle, balloon threads) tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles are consistent (ivy=veins, negative=serpent, diaries=unborn birds) and never mixed inside a clause. Information density is high: “She lifted one gently, as though cradling a wound” performs tactile care, stakes (fragility), and metaphor in twelve words. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends—“corridor echo cartographer” vs “walls dreamed. And now, so would she”—creating legible pattern without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose avoids loops; each sentence layers new metaphor or information. Figurative density peaks in the mirror sequence but stays coherent under the prism logic. Minor scaffold: “not with wind—” refrain appears thrice; because it reweights atmosphere each time, it reads as cadence tool, not artifact. Final line propels by monosyllabic drop after prior lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and clause structure; metaphor is selective (meteorite ink, dove-bone pen) and tied to ritual stakes. One paraphrase loop—“she had come to… she had come to…”—but it occurs early and does not touch closure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences are dense yet never congested: each noun is specific (iridescent, lichen, aquifer) and verbs drive (“routed,” “razed,” “absorbed”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—sky bruised, salt veins—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long liquid clauses for memory, staccato fragments for the ritual placement. Only hairline flaw: two thunder echoes feel proximate; still, the cadence underscores retreat, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ear-test rhythm is impeccable: sentence length and stress rise/fall with each knot’s resistance. Figurative density is high but patterned—serpents, sugar, tea, cat—each returns in a later sentence to earn its keep. Zero paraphrase loops; no filler filter verbs. Only hairline slip: “alarming serenity” is named rather than rendered through body—keeps this from perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor that also advances causality (“stories burn twice” forecasts later bottle violence). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—calligraphy, fire, Morse—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “then” constructions mid-memory; not enough to dull closure momentum or trigger cap.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear is excellent; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. No loops, synonyms, or template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“orange flickers barely disturbing the mist” is fresh without overwriting. One near-misstep: “blushing stillness” is used twice; the repetition is purposeful (grotto blushes deeper) but flirts with mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but purpose-built: every metaphor smelts sense-data into metallurgy—snowmelt “ardor,” rope “python,” bronze “twilight trapped.” No mixed vehicles, no template cadence; only one paraphrase loop (“part of the ice, part of the air, part of me”) and it functions as incantatory refrain. Sentence rhythm breathes with the wax’s cooling, then tightens into single-clause blows across the aperture.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—single sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“wafer seal… cracked like ancient parchment yet still humming”). Figurative language is patterned (honey → obsidian → newborn bird) and never muddles causality. One microscopic loop: “paths choose their walkers” is stated twice with identical phrasing; barely grazes the closure beat, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences do map work (“constellations mapped not in stars but in silence”) and emotional work simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; each chalk line adds new orbital data. Metaphors stay coherent—architect of gravity, syrup under moonlight—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold risk: “empirically ironic” is repeated twice; second use feels slightly ornamental but occurs early enough to be forgiven and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. High density: “resentment, coiled tight for decades, finally unspools” does triple duty (image, backstory, stakes). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“hinge that bent but never snapped” beside “ink bleeding”—but it resolves into coherent physical logic. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from frost-bite fragments to longer breath-units; no synonym loops or filler filters. Figurative load is high but patterned—light, glass, frost—teaching the reader early, so density feels purposeful rather than cluttered. One mixed micro-image (“wings of folded parchment”) barely grazes clarity yet occurs pre-closure, leaving final beat pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “vow, sticky with unresolved emotion, adhered to the spoon like a child clinging to a lollipop” performs metaphor, tactile motion, and emotional sub-text in one stroke. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriting flag: three consecutive adjective-noun pairs in the cathedral-introduction sentence, but pattern is taught early as sensory overload and pays off in pear-heaviness later, so artifact is below −0.3 threshold. Final line—“wisdom, like orchards, grows best when tended across generations”—risks proverb, but the prior honey-spoon has earned the horticultural analogy, so it reads as culmination, not slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense but controlled; metaphor stacks serve pattern rather than congestion. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Strong verbs—“drifted,” “kicking,” “split”—carry motion. Final line “awake” is monosyllabic closure after lush preceding texture, earning cadence shift. Minor register spike (“Conceptual Repricing”) is acceptable as diegetic concept, not narration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: clauses elongate in descent, tighten at climax. Information density high—each sentence pushes image or stakes. Figurative language controlled; no mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb clusters (“She realized… She whispered…”) appear but are offset by sensory immediacy. No loops, scaffolds, or near-duplicate sentences detected; closure beat remains luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances either mechanism detail or emotional charge. High density—“ceremonial rope coiled neatly on a bronze stand” does triple duty: object, history, future tool. Metaphors are spare and accurate (“syntax waiting to be reactivated”). Final line recharges “door that shouldn’t exist” with quiet symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pressure—clause lengthening under hum, fragment bursts under crack release. Metaphors are sustained (ice as score, limestone as throat) without mixed-vehicle clash. No filler, no synonym loops; information is double-layered (sonic + emotional). Final line is propulsive yet open. Only hairline slip: “hammered repose” leans toward badge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm variegates: fragment (“The glass pavilion shivered.”) against sinuous cumulative sentences. Figurative density peaks at the vision beam yet remains coherent—“kaleidoscopic shards across inner walls” is precise, not purple. Near-loops (“between…between…between”) are purposeful, patterned, paid off. Only micro-drag: “retrocognitively blessed” is a five-syllable mouthful used twice; a pronoun substitution could quicken the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    High figurative density is pattern-taught and matched to lyric mode; no mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. One paraphrase loop (“preemptively nostalgic” repeated twice in close proximity) costs −0.2; otherwise rhythm breathes with escalating pressure and ends on crystalline image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information density high—single sentence delivers scent-memory, object history, emotional valence. Zero paraphrase loops; each tile strike advances stakes. Metaphor vehicles consistent (fuse, combustion, resonance) without muddle. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends of chant and promise.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory angle or metaphoric extension. Figurative language avoids mixed metaphors—“moonlight fractured across its surface like memory shards” remains optically coherent. High information density: one sentence couples tide breath, barnacle tremor, salt scent. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates toward final exhale, then cadence releases with “The tide turned,” mirroring emotional unclenching.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lyric avoids purple overload by anchoring every figure to body or action: “droplets rose like silver beads” is immediately followed by fingers breaking hatch. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence stems vary. One micro-loop: “silence…silence…silence” anaphora is purposeful, pattern-taught, paid off in tasting sequence. Closure line lands clean: “tasted of thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid.” No artifact touches final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is rhythmic, information-dense; most lines do double duty (e.g., “gondola dipped…harmonic hum” advances motion + shows passenger effect). Minor paraphrase loop: “didn’t speak…nor did he expect her to” echoes same content, −0.2. Figurative language is controlled; vehicles (storm glass as barometer of feeling) stay coherent. Artifacts do not touch closure; final image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose density high—most lines perform dual duty: “petals cool against her neck” grounds body while signaling starlight drip. Figurative control consistent: no mixed metaphors or purple swell. Sentence variety avoids template cadence; paragraph cuts tight. One minor scaffold: “she moved, counting each step, heart syncing...” could trim to “she counted, heart syncing,” but artifact does not obscure causality or closure. Strong read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences are dense but never congested: “She burns bridges carefully—not with fire, but with measured silence” performs three jobs (trope, negation, method) in eleven words. No loops, no scaffold; each repetition is purposeful reprise, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent within the ash-air-star nexus; mixed vehicle risk is avoided. Read-aloud ear reveals staggered cadences that mimic breath catching, climaxing in the monosyllabic gasp permission.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often performs three jobs—e.g., “She’d carried it as a totem—proof that even in crushing depths, something small could hold back the ocean” reveals backstory, metaphor, and emotional armor. No scaffold loops; rhythmic variation mirrors tide of tension. Final line cadence resolves with off-beat invitation rather than neat moral, keeping momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Every sentence double-loads: “She was eloquently silent—not from absence of voice, but because her thoughts carried more weight…” advances character, theme, and stakes simultaneously. No synonym loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—sound as architecture, silence as lattice—and pay off in the standing-wave mechanics. Final line cadence—“toward the self she had been denied”—lands like a tuning fork.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: clauses lengthen during slow nectar drip, tighten into noun-stripped fragments as threads descend. No loops; each metaphor is single-use and precise—“thawing ice over deep water.” One near-purple line (“shivering bliss—a sensation like frost and flame entwined”) forgiven because it is the sole abstract descriptor of an indescribable bodily state. Closure image of singing soil lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust settled in whispers, in gradients, in patterns shaped by breath, movement, neglect, or reverence” performs three jobs—sensory, thematic, character lens—in one breath. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare and precise. Opening and closing lines are ear-perfect, the final “lets the light do the explaining” landing with imagistic snap. A half-point deduction for two adverb clusters (“tactfully hopeful curiosity”) that could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Metaphors are sparse and purposeful; no mixed vehicles. High density lines (“mirrored surface swallowing the last blush of dusk”) advance atmosphere and plot simultaneously. Only micro-loop: “key…key…keys” thrice in 30 words; not at closure, so −0.2 max, still within 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence performs two jobs: sensory anchoring + causal push (“dewdrops formed faster now” ⇒ prism light magnified ⇒ spell resistance felt). Metaphors are coherent—fog as ink in milk, prism as submerged lantern—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each clause adds new physical state or tactical shift. Final line cadence mirrors a fade-out: three stress drops—“stepped,” “saxophone,” “vanished”—mimic the vested hush.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    High metaphor density is justified by the accumulative design; each figurative layer adds memory-texture rather than clutter. Zero synonym loops or template cadence. Minor risk: “mossy delight” thrice-repeated could feel tic-like, but the final tear-bloom recharges the phrase. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with leaf-fall cadence; no scaffold sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; short beats under waterfall roar, longer cadences in reflective lulls. Figurative density is high but purposeful—no mixed metaphors obscure causality. Minor scaffold: “plans unraveled into possibility” echoes prior “plans are anchors,” yet the reprise reweights meaning. Clean grammar, strong verbs, zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative vehicles stay physically coherent—coin “saturated” with sorrow, cracks “like rivers of liquid light.” Information density is high: one line can layer temperature, guilt, and metallurgy. Rhythm breathes with the scene—drumbeat Rain / short declarative gasp / slow luminous release—without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence swells and breaks in step with gorge music. No paraphrase loops; each line adds sonic or tactile layer. Information density high—one sentence often fuses setting, metaphor, and interior tilt (“tooth glowed warm amber, its edges smoothing as it metabolized sorrow into grace”). Metaphors stay coherent within acoustic geology logic; no mixed vehicles. Zero scaffold; even color words (“violet and gold”) carry sonic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: long breathy sentences mirror anesthesia wearing off, then tighten into shorter clauses at each “I braced.” Figurative density is high but patterned—liquid twilight, spectral violet—taught early and reprised at closure, so it charges rather than clutters. No synonym loops or template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“shore of needles” beside “liquid twilight”—but it lands inside the dream-logic and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense but selective: one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and emotional state (“its edges sharp as regret, its center swirling with captured twilight”). Figurative layering is purposeful, pattern-taught early (“truths that shimmer elusively tangible, like heat haze”), and paid off when the lens actually swirls. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or beat. A single mixed metaphor risk—“veins between towers” beside “clockwork crane” gears—barely grazes clarity and does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“dust like fleeing children” compresses time and guilt. High information density: one sentence often does description, emotion, and foreshadowing. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; copy is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, concept: “The air cracked—not audibly, but dimensionally.” Metaphors stay coherent within negotiable-reality rule-set. One paraphrase loop detected (“equilibrium…favorite disguise” echoes prior “equilibrium monument”) but does not touch closure. Rhythm accelerates into the aperture beat then exhales, mirroring compression/release.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries oral music—internal rhyme (“shard/rosary”), assonant storms—without purple inflation. Every sentence performs double duty: “fossilized starlight” fuses geology and elegy; “velvet drapes stitched from comet-tail silk” layers texture, class, and science-fantasy in five words. No scaffold loops; each image appears once, then evolves—mirrors, glyphs, haiku—building pattern rather than repetition. Opening and closing haiku act as hinge and lock, turning lyrical compression into structural necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: short fragments under pressure, longer sinuous sentences during resonance swell. No synonym loops; “resonance,” “rust,” “light” accrue new meaning each appearance. One mixed-metor risk—“shadows grew teeth” beside “sunflower toward dawn”—but the fairies-vs-flora clash is brief and does not obscure causality. Information density high; every sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—each sentence layers scent, silence, and mythic time without scaffold. Only minor purple clusters (“breath of earth remembering its own becoming”) but the cadence supports the incantatory mode and never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—vehicles stay coherent (“shadows deepen into velvet”). One minor scaffold: “she wept then, not from sorrow, but from…” could compress, yet it does not dull the closure image. High information density; every line advances atmosphere or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Figurative layering is dense yet purposeful: “salt-scarred dunes,” “memory bled into present”—each metaphor maps onto the lagoon’s saline preservative function. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. One near-muddle: “subaquatic glow rising from its depths” could trim to “glow rising from depths,” but the slight redundancy occurs mid-ascension, not at closure, so momentum sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and idea (“He sketched blueprints on rice paper using ink mixed with powdered moonstone”) without paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks mimic the inhale/exhale of lanterns kindling. Minor scaffold: “not to open, but to hold” repeats the infinitive cadence three times in two sentences; trimmed once would sharpen the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for orchard ascension, staccato for cylinder click. No loops or synonym churn; “velvet disquiet” appears once, charged by prior tactile cues. Metaphors stay physically coherent (moss-wet stone, copper-thread pouch). One near-artifact: “slow snow” for petals is faint cliché, but immediate dissolve into subway mist rescues freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is patterned (ice weeps, starlight pools) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs pruned; “She touched a leaf. It felt like childhood…” keeps propulsion. One paraphrase loop—“not melt—weep. / Not with violence, but grace”—reads as purposeful anaphora, not artifact, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: “sky wept embers,” “gravitational sigh” do double duty for image and emotion. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances stance or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor risk—“ink in water” for vacuum bloom—reads as permissible lyric stretch under accumulative lens. Final paragraph slows cadence to match stillness, ear-tested flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers image + stakes + history without scaffold. No synonym loops; “ash,” “grit,” “dust” carry distinct sensory loads. Rhythm breathes with escalating dusk light; no algorithmic patterning. One mixed metaphor (“heat mirages given form”) but it is taught early and coherent under ghost-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density—single sentence often layers image, backstory, and scent. Metaphors sustained without muddle; only one mixed trace (“cracked earth like an old book” slightly overused). Zero loops, no scaffold. Final chime line is crisp, propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors wave-sets: long sentence swell, then crest-cut fragments (“It’s crooked. / It’s glorious.”). No looped stems or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-layer and physically grounded (ink, bruise, twine-star). Only hairline slip—“burnished hush” appears twice, but the reprise is purposeful, charging the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: image, metaphor, and causal nudge (“copper whispered to the trees, urging them into new geometries”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“cathedral,” “mycelium”) fits the caretaker’s diary lexicon. Final paragraph slows cadence to match dying breath—ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job—image, motion, concept—without scaffold. No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors are internally consistent (quiet = bronze, tower = sentinel). Opening and closing lines are crystalline anchors. Minor overwrought flecks (“grammar of solitude”) flirt with purple but serve tone; do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level density is extreme—nouns carry double duty (“blooming jetty” fuses flora + dock, “iron teeth” fuses cannon + jaw) yet remain legible because each metaphor is re-grounded in touch or sound. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric sentences for sowing, staccato bird replies for permission, then a single monosyllable home-ward push. No scaffold: no filter verbs, no “he felt,” no paraphrase loops. Figurative language clusters in the high-pressure sowing beat, but the pattern is taught early (“jetty sighing like a tired lung”) so closure line “trailing dusk like a shawl” feels earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or canine perception. No loops or scaffold; “tinted revelations” recurs with shifting weight, pattern taught and paid off. Metaphors are coherent: leaf = stained glass, grooves = maps, resonance = closeness. One mixed image—“ghost of ozone clinging to broken transmission towers”—reads purposeful, not contradictory. Final third stays clean: “he slept now with the leaf beneath his paw, its glow soft as breath” lands without figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances star movement or her hand movement. Figurative language is disciplined—only three metaphors in 700 words, each anchored to physical action (taffy, held note, frozen fire). Information density is high: one sentence can layer chill glass, family memory, and temporal anomaly. Read-aloud ear varies naturally; no template cadence even in the repeat of “sketch” which accrues mantra force rather than monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build ascent, then staccato sentences mark each swap. Information density is high—one sentence often does description, interiority, and world rule. No mixed metaphors; “static and snow” is precise synesthesia. Only a single paraphrase loop—“secrets he’d gathered” echoed in next sentence—keeps it from the top tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “the baker who still weighed flour with closed eyes” compresses ritual endurance into one stroke. Metaphors are coherent—“silences shaped like breaths” sustains the acoustic motif. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or pressure. Final line “luminous absence of all the small gestures” recharges prior motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is near-flawless: varied sentence cadence, zero paraphrase loops, high information density; figurative layering is dense yet coherent because the physical logic (glass, mercury, stone) remains consistent; only micro-slip—“downward pull that anchored her feet” slightly duplicates “steady her breath” in semantic cluster—stops this short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (setting, metaphor, interiority). Minor template cadence in triple-present-participle openings (“brushing… adjusting… tracing”) but it is voice-motivated and paid off. No mixed metaphors; platinum ↔ tapestry ↔ board logic stays coherent. Final line “mistakes learned to breathe” is crisp, propulsive, leaves resonance. Fits 9+ gate with hairline repetition only.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“The pale spire watched, unmoving, its mist thickening with every session, as if absorbing the emotional residue like a sponge dipped in salt”). No loops or scaffold; each image advances. Figurative language is controlled—only one metaphor per high-pressure beat, never stacked. Opening and final lines are crisp, propulsive anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: every sentence advances image, stakes, or ritual step. Metaphors stay coherent (acid sea = serpent chorus; fox tail = question mark) and paid off. Zero repetition, no filter-verb stacks. Final tear-gold fusion line is crisp propulsion, not purple. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator-accurate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lyrical lines do dual duty: “echoing with drips that sounded like metronomes” sets pace and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors coherent (mirror/water, cave/cathedral). Internal paragraph cuts tight; each advances image or choice. Minor near-redundancy “steps slick with kelp and memory” forgiven for sonic echo. Read-aloud ear excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm is ocean-breath: long sentence sets scent adrift, short clause lands “smooth as a sigh.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Metaphors are physically coherent: “tuning fork struck against bone” fits vibration physics; no mixed vehicle clutter. One near-overwrite—“humming with the memory of the heat wave”—is saved by specificity of peeling paint. Final line is crisp image, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lines are dense but never duplicate: “altars of static / shrines of dial tones / cathedrals of missed connections” triplicates form but each noun re-weights scale, so it reads as crescendo, not loop. Metaphors stay coherent—wind as courier of absence—without mixed vehicles. Filter verbs avoided; instead “it hums back, a low bronze note that vibrates up her arm.” Minor scaffold: “she doesn’t mourn the machines; she mourned the silence” is a paraphrase loop, but it occurs early and does not touch closure beat, so the −0.2 is capped and the prose stays publish-now clean.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers scent, sound, texture without scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: eye as occlusion device, orchard as lung, mycelium as memory—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: fragment “Night fell hard and fast” accelerates, then widens into lyrical closure. Only micro-loop: “truth became a liability—people recoiled from unvarnished honesty” is mild restatement; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“opal dock shimmered under a veil of mist, its pearlescent planks slick with salt and silence” does three jobs in twelve words. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “close his eyes, let the gap to speak” could lose “to speak,” but artifact never touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with differing structures. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors (“lodestone,” “page turning”) stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line can set, characterize, and foreshadow. Minor elevated diction (“petrichor”) fits antique dealer; not jarring. Closure image “smooth stones gleaming like polished promises” is crisp, propulsive. No artifact touches final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Density is high—every sentence advances image or stakes; only one soft loop (“starlight… starlight”) but it serves as incantatory reprise. Mixed metaphors avoided; “lacy menace” and “mercury wine” stay within grotto physics. Final drip of celestial fire onto stone is crystalline, no filter-fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    High figurative density is patterned early (“shimmer between heartbeats”) and paid off in final star-vein image, so earns its lushness. One scaffold loop: “not loud, not dramatic, but soft…” triple negative is deliberate cadence, not churn. No mixed metaphors; physical logic of heat-to-glow holds. Read-aloud rhythm precise.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is orchestral—fragment bursts (“Not away. Not toward. Just… through.”) follow languid accumulations without drumbeat monotony. Figurative density is high yet coherent under the dream-logic taught early; no mixed metaphors obstruct causality. One minor scaffold: “I get jealous of past selves again, a habit as corrosive as it is predictable” could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes—fog / brass / screw / bow—no scaffold loops. Metaphors (“clock like lungs”) stay coherent; “mechanical grace” risks elevated register but fits Ren’s idiom. High density: one sentence often does description + interior + thematic tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors stay consistent—ink as bird’s beak, clouds as silk—no mixed vehicles. No filter-verb stacks; action verbs drive. One tiny scaffold: “She did not rush. She did not flinch.”—but the repetition is pressure-motivated and sits before climax, not in closure beat, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breath and staccato beat; openings vary. Information density high: “tweezers in hand, eyes magnified by spectacles” delivers profession, tension, intimacy in one stroke. No loops or synonym churn; “crumbling score” is the only near-repeat but justified. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: scent as “golden threads” obeys the electrical reveal. Minor scaffold: “she said / he replied” could be pruned, but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric density is high but patterned—repetition of “hiccup,” “spiral,” “hush” functions as accumulative drum rather than loop. Metaphors stay internally consistent (dust = stars, library = lung). One mixed metaphor flagged: “letters lifted…like iron filings around a lodestone”—minor, does not touch closure. No scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Register stable—no sudden academese. Final line is clean, resonant, proof-read.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled—long exhalations versus staccato counts—without algorithmic pattern. Figurative layering (“steam like a sleeping beast”) is sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop—“razor edges” named twice in adjacent sentences—triggers minor −0.2, but clarity at closure remains intact. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual motion.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose shows high density: one sentence can layer glow, root system, and quantum particulates without surplus modifiers. Rhythm accelerates into the dissolve, then exhales into birdsong. No paraphrase loops; only one mixed metaphor (“blurred like chalk on wet pavement”) and it clarifies. Closure line avoids scaffold, ends on luminous unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can smell cedar, reveal father’s collapse, and introduce lantern. No loops or scaffold; “lantern” recurs with new modifier each time (stolen, paradoxical, mica-pane, flaking). Metaphors are coherent—rain “weeping” links to library windows, not mixed. Rhythm accelerates during glyph hunts, then dilates for clover moment. Final line “Begin again” is monosyllabic cadence that re-sets without cliché. Minor micro-tick: “theoretically rebellious” could be trimmed to one word, but voice justifies the slight staginess.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds next causal beat (“condensation wept” predicts damp-shorting jacks). Only two paraphrase loops, both thematic refrains rather than slack. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“cultivated estrangement” recurs thrice, each time with higher stakes), never clogging the final beat. Opening and closing lines book-end with tactile verbs—“spent,” “waited”—anchoring lyric in action.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or emotional charge. Figurative layering is patterned and justified—ink as vessel, laugh as first clause—no mixed metaphors or register drift. One minor paraphrase loop: “preserve the weight of small moments” restated as “small eternal weights” in closing line, but the reprise is purposeful echo rather than scaffold. Near-flawless control under pressure; the final image lands crystal without overwritten haze.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy like a forgotten cathedral” sets tone without stall; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting in the mid-section rumor list (“dandelion seeds on a breeze”) but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned and paid off (notes → chorus → silence). One loop risk: “languages through skin” is reprised almost verbatim; otherwise no synonym churn. Final image “quiet blaze of her own pulse” is precise, not purple. Clean grammar, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long spiral clauses to staccato breaths—“She smiled. Not because things were fixed…”—mirroring anomaly tides. Figurative density is high but patterned; “wet clay” reprises earlier “seeds,” avoiding churn. No loops or scaffold; each image advances story or theme. One mixed vehicle—“warped crust of spacetime” (crust implies solidity vs. fluid anomaly)—is minor enough to leave clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the staccato “Click.” No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal information. Figurative stack is high but patterned, taught by line 3 (“spilled mercury”) and justified by the musical premise. One mixed metaphor—“vessel… for translation”—is minor and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences braid action & image—“She carved the spiral into fallen columns” advances both plot and setting. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay volcanic-consistent. One loop risk: repeated “she painted…she carved…she wove” cadence, but pattern is taught early and serves ritual momentum. Closure line “She smiled” is spare, crystallizing earned stasis without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic variance; sentence lengths breathe with the garden’s pulses. Minor scaffold: “she drummed for…” anaphora risks loop, but each line names a distinct memory, so momentum survives. One mixed metaphor—“auroras trapped in glass”—is forgiven by closure’s reprise. No filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    High-density lines: “She didn’t confront… instead she refolded… sealing another layer of evidence.” No scaffold; metaphors spare and coherent (coin as heartbeat). Read-aloud rhythm varies via fragments and em-dash. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice, object state, or atmosphere. Copy clean: pronoun “she” unambiguous, tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from 5-word pulses to 35-word undulating clauses, rhythm mimicking tidal inhale/exhale. Figurative language is selective—one vehicle per beat—e.g., “ladder of light” followed by concrete tactile clicks. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances glyph, body, or stakes. No mixed metaphors; “bruised clouds” and “drowned sapphire” coexist within aquatic color-plane.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Almost zero scaffolding; each sentence layers job, body, and myth. Occasional flourish—“lover’s reproach,” “bruised indigo sky”—but metaphor stays coherent and pattern-taught. One micro-loop: “not from shore, not from sky” could compress, yet serves drum-beat summoning. Closure image crystal-clear, propulsion uninterrupted.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors whittling cadence; no template runs. Dense lines (“shavings curling like ghosts”) advance atmosphere without purple overload. Minor scaffold: “they’d offered tea, smiled without muscle, and lied…” could trim, but doesn’t dull closure. Metaphors stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Figurative density is high but patterned—quartz hum, glacial melt, lantern-moth return—so the lyric excess feels taught rather than overwritten. One mixed metaphor bruise (“bruised twilight”) is minor. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Information per sentence is double-duty: “barefoot on glacial marble” grounds body and temperature simultaneously. Closure line is uncluttered, earning the near-9 mark.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from long, breath-held accumulations to the fragment “The rosemary twitched.” No synonym loops; each plant is chosen for mechanical property, not color wheel repetition. Metaphors stay physical and coherent—reed as translator, yarrow as antennae—supporting the concept without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm swells and ebbs like the tuning-fork wave; sentences vary from spartan to luminous without purple overload. One mixed metaphor—“silence…layered, like sediment holding the bones of forgotten conversations”—survives because it pays off when literal sediment-colored light falls on her skin. No loops, no scaffold, high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each sentence layers grief-craft, astronomy, and city geography without pad. One mixed-metaphor risk: “time pooled here like spilled ink” is salvaged by immediate calibration “neither advancing nor retreating.” Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Final line (“faintest warmth return to their chest”) risks mild abstraction but is earned by concrete crane-to-chest relay.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image or information without scaffold. Metaphors (liquid runes, forgotten bassline) stay coherent and purposeful; no mixed vehicles or synonym loops. Rhythm modulates from slow glyphs to impatient rain drumming, mirroring thematic recomposition. Only hairline slip: “cultural fragments—advertisements, protest chants...” edges toward list, but the dash localizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is virtuosic: cumulative anaphora (“Then—the shift. / The lanterns extinguished.”) mirrors cardiac arrest without slipping into template. Metaphors are coherent—nostalgia as fireflies, archive as broken ribcage—never mixed. Only two adjacent sentences paraphrase (“She felt lighter… grief was gone… no longer owned her”), but the second reframes ownership, so redundancy is minor. No scaffold, no synonym churn; every clause advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid templates. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay consistent (shadow as ink, smoke, hearth). High information density: each sentence layers archive, emotion, world-rule. One minor scaffold: “watched generations trade grit for gloss” could compress, but momentum recovers next line. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; sentence lengths breathe with ritual pacing. High density per line—“twilight violet at the base, fading to dawn-gold”—each adjective earns its place. One paraphrase loop (“shedding…shedding”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final image is pristine, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. Information density high—each sentence layers image, motive, mythic echo. One mixed metaphor (“silence pooled like spilled ink”) but cleared by immediate context. No scaffold loops; adjective use disciplined. Opening and closing lines bookend with charged hourglass image, satisfying propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is dense yet musical; metaphor layers (“ink still wet with apology”) carry double duty. No synonym loops or template cadence detected; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“lanterns on a river, glowing until they’re ready to go out”—is permissible at closure where the emotional logic overrides physical impossibility. Information density is high: a single sentence can deliver scent, backstory, and foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence music is purposeful: cascading anaphora (“sometimes weeks… sometimes mere hours”) mirrors celestial indifference to human clocks. Metaphors stay physical and consistent—threads, seams, tuning forks—no mixed-vehicle crashes. Information density is high: one line can deliver time-jump, temperature, and emotional shift. Tiny scaffold (“the voices? Gone—”) is voice-motivated, not artifact; it heightens the final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    High figurative density in places ("collapsed superpositions, edges fraying like torn sheet music") risks overwrite, but rhythm varies and metaphors stay coherent within quantum lyric mode. Filter-verb clusters absent; strong verbs anchor most lines. Occasional template cadence ("each step a half-note, each breath a syncopated sigh") is intentional pattern, not artifact. Closing sentence propels without scaffold, meeting 9+ gate for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with varied sentence ingress; “roots retracted with pneumatic hisses” does double sensory work. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mossy oil from before the sixth sense awakened”) verge on purple but stay within voice. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; mercury dip and void crossing are cleanly sequenced. Metaphor vehicles remain physically coherent inside the alloyed ecology.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical; figurative layering is patterned, not chaotic. No mixed metaphors; “roots that curled like question marks” stays physically coherent. Occasional adjectival stack (“gently persistent grace”) is brief and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with vigil tempo; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive: “walls humming with the memory of warmth” performs double duty—atmosphere and backstory—without scaffolding. Metaphors are coherent (frozen hymn, mausoleum of safety) and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies strategically; long clauses spiral up the stairs, short clauses click the bolt home. One paraphrase loop—“safety worth the silence” vs “silence unpardonable”—is thematically purposeful, not artifact. Line-level craft is near-flawless; the final middle C sentence could lose one adjective without damage, keeping it just outside 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is high-density lyric without loops: each metaphor (ink=pellet=grief) advances stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the font scene, then cuts to ash-soft steps. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. The single near-repeat—“rune of drift” thrice—earns its place via ritual incantation rather than artifact churn.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors are controlled: “frayed like nerve endings” is brief, physically apt. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line crystallizes without flourish. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy stays intact even under water.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is selective, never spills across peak beats; metaphors (“sky bruised violet-gold”) remain coherent. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and mythic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causality (e.g., “amber glowed...not gold, not fire, but the deep green...”). Rhythm modulates from languid reflection to staccato chant without template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“teardrop of fossilized resin cradling something that pulsed...with potential”—is earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image stays lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Almost every sentence carries dual duty: sensory image + conceptual twist (“truth had become a chorus of echoes, none daring to lead”). Metaphors are fresh and internally coherent; only one mixed vehicle (“time pooled like spilled ink and reality's threads snagged on rusted gears”) bumps. No scaffold, loops, or register drift. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; high density—“confession transmitted—not as text, but as emotional resonance: shame, longing, betrayal, hope” compresses four abstractions into one sensory flood. Metaphors stay coherent (frost glass = viral spread) and do not collide. Sentence variety accelerates at climax, then exhales into quiet final line. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges snow/muffling motif with new sonic layer.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies from sinuous botanic catalogues to clipped seed-planting beats; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“secret whispered against the sky”) and repriced at closure, so it earns its lyric excess. No mixed metaphors or register drift; “ballast for the soul” is the single abstract leap, justified by prior object handling. Information density is strong—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and micro-action simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Read-aloud cadence mirrors sonic subject: spondaic clusters (“barefoot,” “rail spike,” “cherry-red”) then long open vowels in “Aaaaah.” No loops, no scaffold; each sentence layers fresh sensory job. Figurative language is sparse, precise—metaphors are acoustic physics, never mixed. Final line shards/whisper/satchel propels off the page without trailing exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry dual duty: the pen nib is simultaneously heirloom, weapon, and metonym for marginal truth. Metaphors are coherent—telescope as urban microscope, smoke as thread—never mixed. No loops or synonym churn; each reprise (“orbit,” “ellipse,” “smoke”) gains new conceptual weight. Peak beat—the one-line Q.E.D.—is lean, letting the timestamped photo carry the visceral punch. Minor register elevation in “conceptual repricing” is voice-motivated and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cascading anaphora during static storm, then clipped fragments during glyph burn. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (sound → star → skin) so never muddles causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. One hairline slip—“thawing ice” for voice is familiar, but it occurs in a minor beat and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Information-dense lines: “Each line was a question; each curve, a hesitation” advance both craft and philosophy. Metaphors stay coherent (magnet/iron filings). One paraphrase loop mid-page (“whispers…whispers…whispers”) slightly dulls momentum, but artifacts don’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm varies: long anaphoric rolls crash into short percussive fragments (“It must break doors”). No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new pattern or image. One mixed-metor risk: “cradle empathy in arms of steel” compresses cradle + weapon, but the paradox is intentional and earned. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, metaphoric leap, and causality (“droplets catching moonlight like scattered spotlights” advances both image and the stage-light rule). Zero paraphrase loops; each noun is specific (rigging, marquee, triangle). One mixed metaphor—“timelines like eggshells”—is fleeting and does not touch the closure beat, keeping the 9-band intact.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without scaffold. Only minor loop: “float—not levitate, not hover” is immediate clarification, not churn, and occurs pre-closure; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks dull the final lattice image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths ebb and flow with the hourglass conceit. Information density is high: metaphor often carries exposition (“buttons…held a fragment of decision”) without redundancy. One mixed metaphor—“echo coiled around half-truths”—is minor, does not rupture logic. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense lines (“coiled tight, cold as forgotten vows”) carry triple duty. Rhythm breathes—short clauses underfoot during climb, longer cadence at release. Only one paraphrase loop (“not to mourn, but to find…”) forgiven for lyric symmetry. Metaphors internally consistent (snow as cipher, hatch as promise). No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from liquid cumulative clauses to stark fragment (‘He slowed the horses not by command but by stillness’), propelling the beat. Metaphors (‘percolated truth as others percolated coffee’) are precise; no mixed vehicles. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent ‘he remembered’ anaphoras could compress, but they echo liturgical rhythm, forgivable. No artifacts touch the closure image; final line breathes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple—long liquid sentences for heat-daze, then short fragments at dawn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“dunes that shifted like liquid regret”) and avoid purple overload. No paraphrase loops; each image advances texture or stakes. Minor scaffold: “time… time…” repetition is intentional, forming pulse, not drift. Information density is high—one sentence often does two jobs of sensory cue + thematic hint.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are dense: “crimson sigh marking the end of an era” collapses botany, color, and epoch into one breath. No synonym loops; each prism placement uses fresh verbs (fixed, angled, suspended). Metaphors stay coherent—spilled mercury, oars in water—without mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “She moved… She paused… She reached…” could vary sentence openings, but the cadence serves the rowing motif and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is densely figurative yet disciplined: almost every sentence fuses image and action (“cloud-tides surged… library groaned like a waking leviathan”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical and coherent. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic repetition; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor scaffold: two adjacent sentences beginning “She did not…” create a tiny template echo, but it falls outside the closure beat and does not dull the final image. Information density is high—each line layers memory, object, and stake.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence folds setting, metaphor, and emotional state (“water lilies bowed as he passed, their pads gleaming like green moons beneath his steps”). Figurative language is selective, never stacked; vehicles stay coherent (spiral as compass, thread as circuitry). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“unraveling,” “alights”) replace modifiers. One microscopic scaffold: “the world is never quite the same” restates the obvious, but it occurs outside the closure beat and does not measurably dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence either advances waveform tactic or sharpens campus stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple drift. Occasional scaffold (“she’d seen it before…”) is brief and anchored to present cue. Closure line is clean, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “ribs of stone pressing inward” does double sensory job. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either spatial pressure or metaphor. Figurative language is controlled—one extended metaphor per beat, never stacked. Rhythm accelerates during squeeze (monosyllabic clusters) then opens into longer, melodic clauses under the dome. Minor alliteration (“silver shafts…spirits”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in organ music, so reads deliberate, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-linked (mist as guilt, ribbon as vein). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs. No register drift; diction stays within Elira’s sensory lexicon. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“storms bloomed where deserts slept”) and pays off at closure. One scaffold-like paraphrase—“exile… reversible… turned banishment into pilgrimage”—could be tightened. No artifacts touch the final image; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often performs three jobs—image, metaphor, causality (“He watched CirqueLogix collapse… physics”). No loops or synonym churn; each verb is precise. One mixed metaphor cluster—“hammock strung between chaos and clarity” followed by “dance in the loop”—is forgiven because the final dance literalizes the loop on the boxcar stage. Filter verbs rare; when used (“he noticed”) they serve the calm-as-radar motif.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but controlled; metaphor clusters serve the accumulative design without obscuring causality. Rhythm modulates from contemplative star-catalogue to urgent song-crescendo, then settles into covenant cadence. One paraphrase loop (“burden… weight… sorrow”) appears mid-text but is absorbed by the thematic pattern, not artifactual. Final line is crisp, propulsive, loop-free.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    High-density lines carry triple duty—e.g., “clutched…snipped…mirrored” packs action, backstory, neurology in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; cobalt as color, light, and covenant return builds coherent palette. Rhythm accelerates into final spiral without scaffold loops. Opening and closing sentences anchor and release with mirror-echo precision.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“roots threading through femurs and skulls like lovers”), paid off in the closing root-weave. Zero paraphrase loops. Strong verbs—“surged,” “welled,” “snarled”—propel. One mixed metaphor check: “cloak stitched from funeral shrouds and spite” reads as metaphorical fabric, not literal, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates from diesel-thrum sentences to wind-hum fragments. Information density high: one line often fuses sensory data + metaphor + interior tilt (“echo valley longing, he thought. That’s what this place was. That’s what he’d become.”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay sonic. Minor scaffold in “He didn’t know… Didn’t know…” triplet, but it serves breath-beat under revelation and touches no closure line.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned—magnetic/light/cuneiform—so density penalty is waived. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay within physics of arbor. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the three-beat finale: “Let it grow. Let it remember. Let it become.”—a cadence taught by earlier recitations.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—parchment-folded time, mercury moonlight—and never stack into density fog. Information density is high: one sentence can do world, body, and mood (“She adjusted her spectacles… reveal what others overlook”). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on tide beats. Only hairline slip: “wisdom” label late, a micro-register bump.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose shows high information density: one sentence often layers physical act, emotional stakes, and world rule (“The cave responded—not with sound, but with a deep, harmonic vibration…”). Figurative choices stay geologically consistent—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses as glow intensifies, then relaxes into a single long sentence for the final dissolve, mirroring breath. Zero loops or scaffold; no paraphrase churn. Opening line anchors both voice and stake; closing line offers image-only resolution that re-cues “glow” without repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose breathes with accordion: long sentences swell, short snaps release. No loops; each line adds new sensorium or data point. Metaphor density high but coherent—physical logic never broken. Final clause “station itself had shifted” is precise, avoids anthropomorphic excess. Only hairline slip: “remorse river deltas” borders mixed metaphor yet saved by prior water grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variety is high, figurative density purposeful; only one paraphrase loop (“each mark a vow, each scar a citation”) but it is pattern-taught and brief. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds even when metaphor is surreal. Information density is excellent—single sentences deliver world rule, character state, and tactile detail. Minor scaffold: “the library responded in kind” is a near-template transition, not quite sharp enough for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but metaphor density peaks in the opening two paragraphs—five consecutive bruised/silk/crystal images before action. No mixed metaphors, yet the velvet/constellation/mulberry stack slightly dilutes urgency. Line-level clarity is high; pronoun track clean, no scaffold loops. Final sentence “propagating” avoids participle lag. Could trim two adjectives (“bruised mulberries,” “gilded cage”) to tighten propulsion without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is lush but controlled; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are interlaced (aurora=curtain, silence=velvet) yet mutually coherent, never muddling causality. Information density high: one sentence can layer tool, ritual, and cosmology. Minor scaffolding: “never evaporating, never dimming” is slight double-tap, but it occurs mid-ritual, not at closure, so artifact does not dull final image. Opening and closing lines are sharp image-hooks.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and metaphor in single strokes; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is patterned (tree/grotto equivalence) and paid off. One mixed vehicle: “wine settling in a cask” beside “vineyard hush” momentarily blurs drink and field, but clarity recovers. Final line breathes, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. “Cloth of doubt” metaphor is extended, not mixed—“its hem snagged,” “its weight bowing her shoulders”—and paid off when it pools. Rhythm accelerates at the yank, then exhales with the cloak’s sigh. High density: “conscience for hire” compresses occupation, moral paradox, and market logic in three words.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose loops rare; one paraphrase ripple “each slower than the last / each carrying…” but serves cadence. Metaphor chain (dust, stone, rings, starlight) stays coherent under temporal logic. Sentence variety: long breath-cadence versus fragment “Tomorrow.” Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety, strong verbs, and high density: one line often layers marrow-tuning, sky-reading, and duty-for-skin. Occasional stacked modifiers—“black as obsidian shards”—border on overload but serve the accumulative design; no mixed metaphors. A few noun-phrase appositals feel slightly catalogue-like, yet propel rather than stall. Final line lands with crystalline snap.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence often does three jobs (world-fact + metaphor + emotional state). No loops, no mixed metaphors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Variation in sentence length mirrors thermal expansion/contraction of wonder, a deliberate drumbeat only when the mist pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings; no template cadence. Information-dense: one sentence often sets scene, advances character, delivers metaphor: “cold water swallowing his breath like a vow.” Metaphors are coherent (lanterns ↔ stars, pages ↔ anemones) and don’t collide. Scaffold-free; no synonym churn or paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical blend,” “ Conceptual Repricing”) justified by lyrical mode taught early. Final third free of overwriting artifacts; closure image stays crisp. Minor filter verb clusters (“He understood then…”) but occur in low-action beat so −0.2 max; not enough to cap below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary from long honeyed pulls to short neutron pulses, mirroring breath under stellar doubt. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (sugar in hot tea, dying pulsar) pays into the resonance bank. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Proofing clean, pronouns anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose density is high—“cloak whispering like regret,” “ink faded into ghosts of leviathans”—yet every metaphor serves atmosphere or theme; no purple drift. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric sentences for ritual naming, then a short clause “He smiled, just a little” that lands the emotional release. Zero loops or scaffold; no synonym churn. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “crystal” uses within four lines, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers job—tone, image, causality: “He didn’t chant or conjure; instead, he rebuilt through understanding dripping rates.” Metaphors stay physically coherent (bronze singing, resin filaments) and never stack into purple. Information density high: “tidal coefficients and lunar declensions” compressed into parchment wrist-ties. Final line cadence—barefoot, lukewarm, utterly content—resolves by image, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: every sentence layers weather, object, and emotional tilt—“rooftops breached the waterline like the knuckles of a drowning man” fuses metaphor, geography, and foreshadow. Zero loops or paraphrase clutter; no filler “he felt” filters. Metaphors stay physically coherent; indigo into charcoal, asphalt that “remembered,” paper lanterns under water maintain internal logic. Rhythm modulates from expansive dusk openings to clipped dawn arrivals; final sentence “The wind chime hasn’t sounded since, but no one misses it” lands cadence punch.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies naturally; occasional figurative stacks (“living tapestries,” “divine canvas”) border on excess but stay tethered to POV’s awestruck filter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges motif. Minor purple tick in “chromatic mist” does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often carries world, emotion, and motion (“She unclipped the parachute buckle…like a stone dropped in still water”). Metaphors stay physically coherent—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes with scene pace; paragraph cuts land on image beats. Zero loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Final third is pristine; allows 9+ adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence does dual duty—e.g., “He had surrendered… now sought to vivify…” compresses backstory and present desire. Metaphors are coherent: ink-black sea → brain in jar → aurora synapses form one fluid-light continuum. No register drift; diction stays within contemplative lexis. Final line is a perfectly cut sentence-fragment that lands cadence: “aliveness.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense but breathable; sentence length modulates to mirror obsession’s hypnotic pull. Figurative layering is purposeful, not ornamental—each image seeds a later puzzle mechanic. Minor template cadence in “He didn’t… He didn’t…” triad, but it serves incantatory effect. No mixed metaphors; “obsidian-black, veined with crimson” is precise and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary from breath-length fragments to winding clauses that mirror gust and fade; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but each vehicle (metronome boots, syrupy silence) serves immediate pressure. One mixed metaphor—“laugh burst…like a mouse with stage fright”—slightly strains physical logic. Otherwise propulsion is clean, no scaffold or synonym loops, and final line earns its hush.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with pressure: long anaphoric swells mirror cataloguing impulse; abrupt fragments (“Nothing bent. Nothing broke. Nothing smiled.”) mimic ice-spike breath. Only two minor loops: “swallowed…swallowed…swallowed” is purposeful accumulation, not scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mist as serpents, light as membrane—no mixed vehicles. Final third avoids figurative overload; the crack-of-opening is literalized sound, not symbol override.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates under pressure—fragments and em-dashes mimic iterative pulses; no template cadence detected. Figurative density peaks only at the crescendo, pattern-taught early (“embers whisper”) and paid off in “liquid twilight.” Information density is high: one sentence often fuses sensory, symbolic, and causal jobs (“The air cracked like ice underfoot. Frost bloomed… petals of frozen bloom spreading from the break.”). A single paraphrase loop in paragraph three (“too sharp… too slow”) is justified as alchemist self-correction—minimal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm breathes with scene—long aerial sentences suspend, then fragment at the pulse. Metaphors are tightly welded: “shard of hush” remains consistent physical object before it becomes concept. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed vehicle: “tides in the sky” slightly strains physics but is saved by lyric licence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences carry dual duty—image + concept—without scaffold bloat. A few metaphor stacks (“liquid starlight,” “spectral grotto”) flirt with purple but stay purposeful. No loops or synonym churn; pronouns clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-cast the motif. Lacks the last increment of rhythmic surprise needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: “Marble cracked into lace. Staircases dissolved into ribbons of shadow.” Metaphors stay congruent—fabric/vein/stitch lexicon coherent. No synonym loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor scaffold: repeated “she remembered” anaphora thrice; serves cadence but slightly visible. Final line anchors motif: “bare feet silent on the threshold of what came next,” echoing barefoot opening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; metaphor chains (“invisible lace across spacetime”) are purposeful and sparse; no loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles; one clause (“conceptually upward”) momentarily strains phrasing but does not blur causality or dull the closure image, holding the line at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose breathes: long breathless clauses for pursuit, then short declaratives at release. Metaphors are controlled—no spillage between “liquid gold puddles” and “surrendered hands.” One scaffold spotted: “they’re not coming back... but that doesn’t mean you’re forgotten” tells what the photograph in the girl’s hand has already shown. Otherwise density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence, verbs stay strong. Information density high—“frost feathered the glass like breath on a mirror” collapses three senses into one stroke. One mixed metaphor (“spilled night” adjacent to “dendritic veins”) but resolved within clause and does not blur closure. No loops, no scaffold, zero paraphrase—every line advances image, pressure, or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, sound, or stake. Metaphors are coherent—diamond flaws as “trapped screams”—and physically sustained. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses for canyon layers, staccato fragments for articulation beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and release the acoustic motif with mirror precision.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphor risk—“vine glow dimming as gravity hiccuped”—but physical logic holds because hiccup is literalized physics. Information density high: “patience”/“regret” pots compress time-bending botany into two nouns. Final chord sentence propels to closure without syntactic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety mirrors musical phrasing; no template cadence detected. Figurative layering (“stone softening like candle wax”) stays physically coherent. One near-loop: “note by note” appears twice—spaced enough to read as intentional motif rather than scaffold. Information density high; each sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: “each revolution echoing like a skipped heartbeat” simultaneously propels bike, signals anxiety, and seeds the cardiac motif that ends with the child’s unfrightened heartbeat at thunder. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative density peaks at drone lift yet stays coherent: storm/bottle/bird/prayer form a single extended image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “broken promises learn to fly.”

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; clause lengths mimic breath of sanding, turning, singing. Metaphors stay concrete (halo as “captured star exhaling”) and internally coherent. A single scaffold loop—“the misting hush outside thickened / the hush remained, deeper now”—is allowable as pattern reinforcement. No mixed metaphors or register drift; every sentence advances image or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent—hyperbolic geometry as “language wide enough” sustains across paragraphs. No register drift; “tattered silk scarf—once vibrant indigo, now ghostly lavender” is precise, not purple. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“humming softly, sanely eccentric, utterly satisfied”) resolves with cadence shift that recharges “sanely eccentric” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is dense: “she angled the palette’s facets to catch specific wavelengths—the precise hue of hope at 5:47 a.m.” does triple duty (action, metaphor, time-stamp). No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—three metaphors per paragraph max, never stacked in climax. Rhythm modulates: pre-dawn hush in elongated vowels, child’s laugh in monosyllabic peal. Copy-clean; pronouns track through shifting temporal clauses without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “walls became sky, sky became memory” compresses three transitions in six words. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent—star as needle, idea as fledgling—never mixed. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to fragmentary shards during shatter. Final line recharges “no one would try to lock it away again” with prior ribbon/hair motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled—clause length modulates with revelation beats; no template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors (“cathedral of lost seasons”) stay single per beat, avoid coherence break. One scaffold trace: “not grief, but vacancy” could be cut without loss, minor. Figurative language avoids muddle in peak beat; information density high. Slight tightening still possible, hence 8.4 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Rhythm flexes: long clauses for circling, single-line punches for grit. Sentences multi-task—e.g., “She annotates his margin with a fingertip: a single line bisecting his despair, angled at 37 degrees — the same as the shadow in the glass” advances plot, imagery, and causality. No loops or mixed metaphors; “tea-stained smudge” stays physically consistent. Final line crystallizes without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances weave or wonder. Figurative layer is patterned early—“each snip a stanza”—and paid off in the mother-of-pearl shimmer. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay botanical or luminous. Read-aloud rhythm pulses like quiet breath, accelerating at shell-crack then subsiding.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere). No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. High density without clutter; final line earns its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Density is high: each sentence performs witness-work—advancing spiral, staining stone, or reweighting silence. Figurative control keeps vehicles meteorological (“arches wept condensation”) and geological (“map tears”), never mixing planes. No loops, no scaffold; even repeated “not” denials serve percussive negation that accrues into proof. Final line cadence—“invisibly, audibly, eternally”—triples adverbs yet lands because prior particulars have earned the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Metaphors are disciplined—“glass grew warm” stays within physical logic. Information density high: one line can locate plane, logbook, coordinates, emotional valence. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from staccato catalogue to spiralling final clause. No scaffold; paragraphs cut clean. Closure line—“It was enough”—achieves concision without curtailing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Information density is high: one sentence often layers gravity physics, parental lullaby residue, and obsolete tech. Metaphors are coherent—taffy time, ozone taste—none collide. Rhythm modulates: fog-bound anapests yield to terminal-flick trochees. Minor scaffold appears in repeated “she…then she…” opens, but never within the closure beat. Final gold bridge line is propulsive, uncluttered, leaves reader mid-air as required.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates with elevator motion; paragraph lengths visually ascend then contract. Figurative density is high but patterned—light/ice/glass motif taught early and paid off in final lens. No synonym loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“lantern left burning in a frozen hall”) is minor and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—e.g., “She’d classified Stratocumulus #47 as ‘resigned acceptance’ after watching it hover for three dawns, unmoving, as if waiting for permission to dissolve” advances lore, stakes, and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; “string broke” recurs only to anchor backstory. Figurative layer is patterned early and paid off at closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with gondola sway.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sentence density high—each line performs setting + motion + metaphor: “dawn bled through leaves like watercolor on vellum.” Zero paraphrase loops; no synonym churn. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“fractally precise”) and paid off in ceiling swirl. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied openings, no drumbeat; final line two-beat silence lands with lip-close consonants.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: single sentences layer chalk physics, starling response, and emotional charge. Metaphors are consistent—light as lute strings, birds as inkblots—and paid off in final beam. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs. Minor over-modification (“stranded luminance” repeated) but does not stall closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentences vary in length and avoid template churn. Occasional poetic lift (“silent symphony,” “blue-white gloom”) flirts with overwriting but stays within pattern taught early. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; final image is clean. Metaphors stay coherent—gears as constellation scars—though “time’s own fractured heartbeat” nudges toward mixed personification.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“chime like liquid glass” appears once and pays off. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but stays within ghost-narrator lexicon. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image or pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Every sentence advances image or cadence; no scaffold, loops, or synonym churn detected. Metaphors nest (clockwork stanza, fractal lullaby) but remain coherent under the lullaby conceit. Rhythm modulates from groaning steps to velvet hush, accelerating then suspending breath in sync with cosmic shutdown. The final line hands the reader the “first note after silence,” a closure image whose clarity forbids artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density: sentences braid science and grief without slack. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; “foam” reappears only when reweighted. Opening and final lines serve as frame and cadence shift. Minor elevated register in “symphonic chaos” but justified by POV.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for cloud-sea arrival, staccato ledger entries for tightening. Information density high—“bottled moonlight glowed faintly, not with illumination but with implication” does double sensory-conceptual work. No mixed metaphors; moonlight stays lunar, absence stays hollow. Zero loops; each sentence advances inventory or image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence layers new sensory or emotional information. Figurative control: “sandstone walls glistening under a bruised twilight sky” keeps vehicles coherent—bruised = purple-green + pain. No mixed metaphors at climax; liquid shadow, lunar rhythms extend the tidal motif cleanly. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths breathe with descent/ascent movement.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo clauses, then caesura—achieving read-aloud propulsion. Information density high: one sentence can layer tool, myth, and stake (“cuckoo weight… metaphor for grounding runaway thought”). Two mixed-metaphor risks—“celestial maps whispered guidance” and “seismic whispers”—but they cohere under sound-wave motif. No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; final line anchors sunrise without inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: cascading anaphora (“She did not… She modified…”) teaches pattern early, pays off in final mirrored clause. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mirror = silvered cracks = constellation—no mixed vehicles. High information density: single sentence often layers geology, neurology, and emotion. Minor scaffold: “synaptic plasticity” is repeated four times; loses −0.2 for near-paraphrase loop but never muddies closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    High metaphor density in every sentence risks purple fatigue, yet each vehicle serves atmosphere or physics rule; limited −0.3. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences vary openings. Information density strong: one line often does two jobs (e.g., “boots left no prints” shows weightlessness + character habit). Closing couplet relaxes cadence, giving earned exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density—most sentences carry image + motion + metaphor; yet occasional stacked qualifiers (“green, slow mouth”) verge on purple. No loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. The final “softer than a moth’s wing” line earns its hush through prior sonic build, avoiding sentimental overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pulse; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent (field as board, silence as geometry). One mixed image—“twilight painting the sky in bruised violets”—edges purple but fits POV. Information density high; each line layers sensory, emotional, thematic labor. No artifact obscures closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from weighted clauses (“vault of stars, the shadowed workshop…”) to staccato micro-actions—“She switched”—accelerating toward climax. Metaphors are consistent sonic/celestial hybrids; no contradictory vehicles. Information-dense lines carry triple duty: “hummingbird vertebrae” implies delicacy plus ecological stance plus wonder. Zero loops; each sentence adds frequency detail or physical consequence. Only nit: “sincerity was her only script” borders on aphorism, but is instantly grounded by tactile workshop response.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences carry scent, philosophy, and foreshadowing (“corpse flower seed…when the tide’s thought turns”). No scaffold loops; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (roots/neurons, petals/palms). Minor purple tinge in “velvet scream” and “wildflower hush” but justified by lyric mode and paid off in closure. Rhythm breathes with paragraph variation; opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: no filter verbs, no scaffold, high information density (“scanner flickered, useless; tech stuttered here”). Metaphors are grounded in her profession—“liquid compass needles”—and never overrun the physics. Micro-rhythm varies: caesura fragments under inversion stress, then settled cadence as gravity returns. One mixed image—“petals swirling in slow, silent cyclones” juxtaposes speed vs. silence in a way that slightly blurs, not enough to dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences perform dual duty: “The patch… weighed more than it should” fuses tactile detail + guilt. No loops, no scaffold; each paragraph advances map, stake, or mood. Metaphors are spare, physics-true: “whispering secrets only physics could translate” keeps atmosphere without purple drift. Closing line lands clean, no artifact interference; diction stays in investigator’s credible register.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhythm modulates from cathedral-long sentences to shard-like fragments during strikes; no template cadence detected. Information density is high—one sentence often does scent, color, and emotional temperature. A single mixed metaphor (“silence…woven from silence and starlight”) is forgiven because it reifies the hush as fabric, supporting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated: every sentence layers custodial lore onto sensory grit. Figurative control avoids mixed metaphors—avalanche silence, spider-silk note, spilled-ink shadows all serve hush motif. No loops or scaffold; “avalanchingly quiet” coins an adverb that justifies itself. Momentum breathes with paragraph breaks that mirror breath across reed; final line is clipped, monosyllabic, sealing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm accelerates during press runs, then exhales in short declaratives at closure. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop: “borrowed personalities like coats left at a threshold” appears twice with minimal variation. Otherwise high density without clutter; final glyph line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, metaphorically audacious yet internally coherent; only a faint synonym echo (“wonder spilled through / wonder lingered”) prevents a 9+; no loops or mixed metaphors dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty—e.g., “She would not publish. She would not preach. She would place…” propels action, clarifies values, and cadences closure. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally consistent (frost as skin/diary/confession). One mixed metaphor—“mist…velvet”—occurs mid-text but is forgiven under lyric mode. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the melt, then snaps to stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “plum blossoms fell upward” packs motion and inversion in five words. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (tapestry, loom, weave) stay coherent. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “raveling silence” phrase, but it functions as accumulative drumbeat rather than loop. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt the weight”) is forgivable at the necklace beat and does not touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    High-density lines—“time existed between understanding and confusion” doing triple duty—propel without scaffold. Figurative control precise: mixed-metaphor vigilance finds none. Minor paraphrase loop in “magic never did when shared without greed” / “magic returned, woven into soil, steel, and spirit” costs −0.2; closure image untouched. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“ghosts of engines,” “cathedral of silence”—never dense enough to obscure causality. High information density: one sentence can layer sensory cue, world rule, and emotional charge. No mixed metaphors; final line lands clean with the concrete noun “bones” anchoring the conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise—‘velvet dark,’ ‘ghost-light’—and cohere with lighthouse physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action (humming louder) that recharges earlier motif. High density: ‘oil drums, rope coils, replacement wicks’ triples as cargo, character, and metaphor for grief maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density is extreme yet patterned; the piece teaches its lyric cadence early and pays off in the lantern-flare crescendo. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“sacerdotal ink”) stays within the herald’s mythic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density—single sentences layer job, motive, sensory cue: “rain-slicked parchment and forgotten equations.” Figurative language disciplined: “grief… etched in hairline fractures” sustains metallurgy metaphor without muddle. Minor template cadence in “not with X, but with Y” pair; repetition serves incantatory effect and does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image that recharges “mapped” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “tapestries of collective hope spun each morning by voices rising in unison” packs world-rule, metaphor, and stake in one clause. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. One mixed vehicle—“fireflies pinned behind crystal” beside “ribbons of apricot”—but the imagistic shift occurs at pattern break, justified by the release of hoarded light. Rhythm modulates from languid ascent to staccato cracks without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence performs at least two jobs (advance, deepen, charge). Figurative control: “moonlight pooled like liquid silver” is standard yet brief, serving as stage light for the climactic stance. No mixed metaphors; paradox titles are literal objects first, symbols second. Rhythm modulates: drawn alliteration mid-paragraph, then staccato shelf-shift. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; final line crystallizes closure without exposition. Proofing clean—no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, thematic echo, and micro-action (“vine swallowing marble” fuses setting, decay, hush). No paraphrase loops; each image advances the gestalt. Metaphors stay physically coherent (bread crust = hardened promises) and are not stacked. One near-template cadence (“She doesn’t…”) is justified by voice pattern, so only a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variation is deliberate: frost-etched fragments for sensory immediacy, then longer rolling clauses that mimic aurora loops. Occasional micro-overwriting (“feather precision”) is brief and motif-consistent; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. The final line’s monosyllabic exhale lands cleanly, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—each sentence moves position or reveals texture; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay physically coherent (sleeping serpent chain, tar-over-whispers). One register bump—“conceptual repricing” territory in “relic he swore kept time with the tide, not the clock”—but it’s brief and voice-motivated. Strong prop tracking: fob clasp, gin sleeve, crate of eels all reappear with altered state.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaths match aurora pulses. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“taste changed with proximity”) so payoff justifies risk. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (copper-ozone-honey). Minor scaffold: “terrestrially cosmic” appears twice—accepted as thematic refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence layers metaphor and action—“the cave remembers imprisonment too” fuses world and psyche without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; varied sentence rhythm; figurative language disciplined to lyric pattern. Minor purple fleck—“millennia of fallen geodes”—but accepted under accumulative lens. Closure image uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“ She pressed a damp cloth to her forehead, breathed through her sleeve, and kept walking”). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Final line’s “ drop by drop, word by word” is earned repetition, not template.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies from wind-long breaths to crystalline fragments; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are integrated and physically coherent—“pendulums…harvested from the last melting pole.” High information density: each line does denotation, atmosphere, and theme work. Minor elevated register in “conceptual repricing” is voice-motivated and legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    High-density lines carry triple duty: “magnetic north shuddered its slow pivot” evokes external crisis, internal disorientation, and planetary scale in eight words. Occasional poetic stack (“folded fractals of terror compressed into humming orbs”) risks overwriting but stays pattern-taught; no mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and sentence variety; only one scaffold loop (“humming again. And the next.”) that mildly dulls momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one line often advances atmosphere, character, and object state simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm swells and recedes with scene breath; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—each metaphor returns mutated (spinner, tide, cipher), satisfying coherence test. Information double-loads: “hangman’s dice clicked softly against her hip” conveys object, sound, backstory, stakes. Zero loops, zero scaffold; only hairline is occasional adjectival stack (“phosphorescent algae”), forgiven under lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for salt chandeliers, staccato fragments at threshold. Metaphors are coherent—whale ribs as cathedral buttresses sets vaulted scale without mixed logic. Information density high; single sentences do triple duty: “She exhumed meaning…with shovels or picks, but through patterns in coffee grounds—swirls that mirrored tidal charts.” Only micro-slip: “gravity pockets” is repeated twice in close succession; would trim one.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic yet varied; sentence length undulates like brook current. Figurative layering is dense—moonlight as rain, prophecy as spine—but each vehicle returns to water or paper, creating coherent texture. No loops, no scaffold, zero paraphrase churn. A single mixed metaphor (“velvet void where meaning pooled”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose density is high: one sentence pitches receipt-origami, dew-pluck, soundless doorknob turn—three tactile reveals in eight words. Metaphors stay coherent within one domain (astronomy ↔ scarring ↔ metallurgy) so “meteor scars” and “patina catching starlight” echo later key-metal without mixed logic. No loops, no scaffold; cadence modulates from long breathy accumulations to the clipped final line “Only truth, steeped and waiting” to mirror kettle-lid tension release.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence variety is high; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative density serves pattern—each spiral image re-encodes grief—yet never muddles causality. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One passive clause (“memories were safe”) is strategic, emphasizing stasis after release. No scaffolding; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: each sentence advances ink, emotion, or architecture. No synonym loops; metaphors internally consistent. Two near-adjacent “sigh” images (marble / scroll) create faint echo, not loop. Rhythm modulates from solemn drip to accelerated flares, matching tension. Minor over-modification (“slow, solemn rhythm”) is the only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge; no loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (veins of silver, sleeping serpents) stay coherent; rhythm modulates with longer crescendo sentences under starlight, then shortens at dawn. Only hairline slip is “weight of a question that had hollowed her” (slight abstraction) but it’s embedded in embodied context.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—glass softened by pressure/time, miniature town a slumped smear—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density is high; one line can do three jobs (“She weaves truth carefully, this woman who speaks to the drowned and the dreaming…”). Opening and closing lines precisely bracket voice and re-charge motif. A single near-purple phrase (“dawn bleeds violet”) is earned by accumulated chill, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences do double duty: “roots drinking poisoned earth, fruit swelling sweet despite gamma winds” packs world-rule, sensory body, and contradiction into one line. No scaffold, loops, or paraphrase; each image is net-new. Metaphors stay coherent—diamond as tuning fork, stillpoint as silence-zone—without vehicle clash. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “rooted” motif. Only micro-flaw: “fiercely, stubbornly, uncursed” adverb stack is redundant but occurs post-closure and does not obscure the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ear test: cadence rises with storm, then breath-long sentences at final spiral. Occasional stacked metaphors (“frozen wave,” “caged beast,” “cosmic lantern”) flirt with overwriting, but all serve tone and are seeded early. One paraphrase loop: “wasn’t weather—it was a veil” echoes “storm wasn’t weather” two lines later (−0.2). Otherwise crisp, propulsive, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathes: “key leapt from her pocket as if pulled by tide” performs action, image, and personification in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks or synonym loops; figurative language spikes only at high-pressure beats and each vehicle is consistent (tide, resonance, mercury). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“climbed back into the world…a guardian whose greatest strength was…consonance”) lands with cadential uplift that recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—“bruised sky,” “unyoked magnetic song”—vehicles stay consistent with physics of scene. One minor scaffold: “she did not…” refrain repeated 3×; however, it functions as ritual beat, pattern-taught, paid off in final renunciation. No mixed metaphors; information density high; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, data, or stake. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“shadows stretch like reaching fingers” appears once, taught by lantern-light). High information density: “runoff drips…echoing like whispered confessions” fuses sensory, historical, and forensic registers in one stroke. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “brass dust and tarnished brass” avoids redundancy by specifying different sensory facets. Metaphors stay mechanical—cathedral of cogs, robin’s egg—never mixed. No loops or scaffold; each sentence either advances tool-action or refracts Elias’s guilt. Only hairline slip: “vibrant hush” is abstract in final line, but it is earned by the preceding tick and smile, so momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences vary from propulsive fragments to lyrical cadence; no template churn. Figurative density is high but patterned—mirrors, gears, acid—each recharged at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; “green mist” and “violet light” do different sensory work. One mixed metaphor (“bronze throat”) is minor and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence double-duty: “Wore it to the archive’s deepest vault” simultaneously moves body and mythologizes object. No loops, no filler, no mixed metaphors; even poetic flights (“echo of forgotten songs”) stay tethered to acoustic data. Tense and pronoun chains remain immaculate across 700+ words.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Density high—single sentences layer time, body, and metaphor: “boots crunch brittle frost as shifting ice floes groaned below like ancient beasts turning in sleep.” Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “never rushing, never hesitating” could trim one. Closure beat clear of figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the clipped “She froze. / Around her, the marina fell still…” mirroring cardiac syncope. No synonym loops; each sensory image is net-new. One mixed metaphor—“hung to dry on the rigging of forgotten ships”—but it occurs early, before peak pressure, and does not tinge closure. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory cue, backstory shard, and emotional tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work (“Juice stained her fingers. ‘Sweet,’ she said, surprised.”). No scaffold loops; figurative language thins during peak emotional hand-off, preventing purple clutter. One near-miss: “poetry wrapped in dirt” risks aphorism, but immediately grounded by tactile vineyard step.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for stillness, fragments for gear-clicks. Metaphors stay physical (stone, dew, pollen) and coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds density. No artifact touches the final image. Read-aloud ear test passes at every paragraph break.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is lyrical, varied, propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without scaffold. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (“broken pieces,” “arc of grief”) and pays off in the final arc of swifts, so density is earned. Zero paraphrase loops; each photograph offers new concrete detail. One mixed metaphor (“question mark carved in grief”) is forgivable at this length and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors time, reveals method, colors atmosphere). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay internally coherent. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing,” “acoustic instrument”—are scholar’s legitimate lexicon, justified by POV. One mixed image: “origami made of breath” is physically impossible but reads as intentional lyric compression rather than error; it touches, not obscures, closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise: “tombstones of abandoned afternoons” for tapes, “sandpaper dragged across velvet” for aging sound—vehicles remain physically coherent. Information density high: “chalk trembled…anchor against tide of vanishing moments” does triple duty—object, body, theme—in nine words. No figurative muddle in peak beat; final “chalk humming faintly” is literal object still vibrating, not ornamental personification.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentences build to the single leaf whisper, then short clauses mirror tick-becomes-visible. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (clock as metronome, time as lattice) reappears in closure. Zero scaffold; no synonym loops. One mixed risk—“storm-tossed milk” jostles against lunar vacuum—but the image is brief and does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence length, no template cadence. Figurative density peaks mid-story but pattern is taught early—vinyl = life = broken = sacred—and pays off at closure. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevated diction (“luminous, undeniable”) tolerated because it matches hospice-lullaby register.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often performs world, body, and causality. Figurative language is selective—“spirals of gravity,” “liquid night”—and never stacks into purple. One paraphrase loop (“not metaphorically… literally”) is intentionally rhetorical, not scaffold. Clean grammar, zero filler beats; the final paragraph cadence mirrors the orrery’s backward spin.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new texture (wax limbs, porcelain eyes, folded letters) while advancing the accumulative design. Metaphors are coherent—“shard of moonlight” bridges tooth and night, never contradicting physics. Information density peaks in “stuffed with dried lavender and folded letters addressed to no one,” doing three jobs at once. One microscopic filter-verb cluster (“seemed to forgive”) is voice-motivated and forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences do triple duty: sensory detail, emotional state, thematic freight—“Each stroke was a breath, each rotation a memory weighed not in grams, but in grief and grace.” No scaffold, no loops; every adjective earns keep. Figurative logic consistent: mist as sleeping dragon remains alive but never battles the gleam of glass. Read-aloud ear varies naturally; closing sentence dissolves into monosyllabic drip, sigh, shimmer—flawless cadence match to earned hush.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is scaffold-free; every sentence carries image + motion + metaphysics. Metaphors are coherent within marine lexicon (shell, tide, salt) and never mixed. Rhythm mimics breath-eddies: longer clauses gathering, then short gasps (“She did not weep.”). Zero loops or filler; diction remains within novelist’s lyric register. Final line lands with punctuating silence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: varied sentence openings, paragraph lengths echo musical phrasing. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and tied to Elara’s craft: “the vine…curled…like a question” extends mechanical curiosity to vegetal life. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; information density is high. One near-overwrite: “golden stories with each note” edges toward abstraction, but the next clause grounds it in “not fables, but truths,” averting purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: one sentence can anchor place, body, tool, and myth (“She placed it atop a flat stone, brushed snow from its face, and began her ritual…”). Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “each placement a stanza… each object a syllable” is paraphrastic but brief and thematic, not closure-touching. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends that recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphoric layering (“echoes wearing poetry’s coat”) never muddles causality. One scaffold loop—“he didn’t believe in ghosts… but echoes?”—is forgiven because it crystallizes the physics/poetry fusion. Rhythm modulates with working pace; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: clause-rich braids under low-tempo chill, then tighter fragments at lamp flare. Information density high—“kerosene lamp burner, unlit but warm to the touch, its brass rim humming faintly with residual heat from the last soul it had helped calcify” packs object history, temperature, and moral cost into one stroke. No synonym churn or mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent to geology/textile lexicon. A single scaffold trace—“the lamp’s glow fading like a whale sinking into midnight depths”—is earned by prior whalebone motif, not decorative. Sentence openers vary; no template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line economy high: single sentence (“She wasn’t sculpting memory; she was trying to contain it—before it spilled again”) performs three jobs—negates memorial trope, states intent, raises spill-risk. Metaphors stay coherent: time as amber/frost fits preservation motif; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “here and gone” echoed four times; still functions as mantra, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm rises to kettle scream, then hushes—propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Density high: single sentences weld sensory, technical, and emotional work (“steam curling like breath against cold concrete”). Strong verbs replace modifiers (“cannibalized,” “threaded,” “fractured”). No filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges sextant-light motif. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is breath-synced; sentence variety prevents algorithmic cadence. Figurative language is selective—one extended metaphor per beat—avoiding purple overlay. Information density high: “polished brass pendulums until they gleamed like liquid sun” does sensory, occupational, and symbolic work. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffolding. Opening and closing lines are anchor-flawless—first line seeds silence, last line gilds it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences couple weather, tool, memory theory; no scaffold. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for twilight calm, fragments at glint moment. Metaphors stay consistent (architecture, tides, light angles) without muddled vehicles. Only minor loop: “quiet ruins” echoes “serene upheaval” twice; yet the reprise is purposeful, not churn.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “jagged, frozen lightning captured in silica” does triple sensory job. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the storm-weave conceit. One near-purple phrase—“oceanic hush that settled as fog rolled”—but it pays off thematically. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are surgical.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: syntactic variety, no template cadence; information dense—one sentence often does two jobs (e.g., “They did not pray. / They did not hope. / They mapped.”). Figurative layering is controlled; metaphors stay coherent (map/grammar/sea). Minor scaffold: “each descent a quiet elegy… each crunch…” risks paraphrase loop but differs in object (leaf vs foot) and serves rhythm, so forgiven. Pronouns, tense, punctuation clean. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “velvet tunic frayed and stained, his crown dented like a crushed beetle shell” performs characterization, visual, and metaphor in one breath. Occasional overwrought stack (“chromatic pulses, like dawn breaking through stormclouds”) but metaphor family stays coherent—light, sound, mineral. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates from lullaby cadence to vibration hum matching climax. Closure line clean: “But that was genesis enough.”

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm mimics breath: long tidal rolls for lagoon calm, staccato “En route.” for dispatch. Metaphors stay mutually consistent—kelp, glass, tide—avoiding mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can marry sensory cue, backstory shard, and future obligation (“black sand clings… blessing”). A single paraphrase loop (“not to fix, not to bury, but to listen”) is forgiven because it cadences the closure; no artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm breathes with her pace: opening cadence slow, clauses stacking like star-orbits; mid-section accelerates with anaphoric memory bursts; final paragraph hushes into monosyllabic drop. Figurative language is sparse, selective, and pattern-justified: “dry throats choked with moss” fuses anatomy and architecture without mixed metaphor. Zero scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or atmosphere. Final line’s single monosyllable (“drop”) lands as sonic punctuation that recharges prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet density of metaphor in every sentence creates micro-bloat; three adjacent “of” phrases recur four times, a template cadence that dulls peak beats. Mixed metaphors—petals as punctuation, nebula as cathedral—coexist without contradiction but accreting ornament. No scaffolding or synonym loops inside single beats, yet paragraph breaks follow identical arc (action / reflection / image), producing visual monotony. Closure sentence is clean, so artifact cap stays −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is patterned early (“dirge for drowned hours”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each image serves atmosphere or interiority. Sentence rhythm accelerates during climb, breathes during pause, resumes with cadence shift. Opening and final lines anchor voice and recharged motif.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid purple patches. Strong verbs—“silo’s curved walls drank,” “threads curling like smoke”—carry weight. One clause misstep: “its hinge sighing when opened” repeats auditory cue from earlier “sigh” but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    High metaphor density is justified because pattern is taught early (fox-fur, meteorite ink) and pays off in the humming parchment. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory information or causal cue. A few simultaneous participle phrases (“staring not at… but at…”) could be clearer, but they never obscure cause/effect. Closure beat is clean, propulsive, artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like rests and runs; sentences vary from fragmentary arpeggios to longer legato flows. No paraphrase loops; every image either advances lore or deepens character. Mixed metaphors avoided—moon’s “boots of river clay” stays physically consistent with silt and rust. Only micro-slips: “thistled calm” is coinage, but context teaches the neologism and it lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes—varied sentence lengths mirror rocking motion; only minor scaffold (“she does not… she does not…”) but it pattern-teaches refusal; no mixed metaphors, high density, zero loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density—each sentence layers archive, body, concept—yet occasional Latinate stacks (“methodology incarnate”) flirt with register drift. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final line “grain by grain” is deliberate cadence, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: each sentence layers physical detail with emotional acoustics—velvet “absorbed footsteps, whispers, even the rustle of turning pages” performs both setting and metaphor in one breath. No synonym churn; “subtracting noise” returns with variant inflections (verb, noun, imperative) that prevent loop. Metaphors are coherent—maple leaf as “burnt parchment” fits library of archived arts. Opening and closing lines pass paragraph-cut test: removing either would delete the story’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud ear is impeccable: varied sentence rivers, no template cadence. Information density high—each prune snip performs three jobs (action, memory taste, thematic accrual). One microscopic loop: “something beautiful from the ruins” appears twice in adjacent sentences; the second could compress to “it.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles (tide, dough, cathedral glass) stay within chef-poetic register. Closure line is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet aerated—each sentence carries scent, motion, and metaphysical freight without paraphrase loops. Only one mixed vehicle—“silence pooled like spilled ink” beside “butter-yellow glow”—momentarily muddies the sensory hierarchy, but the rhythm recovers before the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “foxglove-stained glass ampoule” packs dye, fragility, toxicity in four words. Zero loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors kept coherent (“scalpel dipped in honey” unites sharp/gentle telepathy). Sentence rhythm swells and retreats like surf. Only micro-slip: “animate lifelessness” appears twice in closing paragraph; second use could be cut for 9+ purity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sentences do triple duty—advance image, compress philosophy, maintain rhythm: “The staircase absorbed them without protest, the symbols vanishing within minutes, as if the structure itself were digesting his intellect, converting proof into propulsion.” Zero paraphrase loops; every clause adds new conversion. Metaphors stay coherent—geometry, engine, digestion—no mixed vehicles. High-pressure beats favor short, percussive fragments that sync with pulse. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-charge motif: echo of hollow promise becomes captured texture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is loop-free, with high-density sentences that layer scent, pigment, and resonance without scaffolding. Metaphors (ink pooling like silence) stay coherent; only a faint cadence repetition (“not for… but for…”) nicks perfection, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates—long cadences for waterfall roar, staccato for drumbeat—without algorithmic pattern. Mixed metaphors (“rosewater dread,” “sweetness clinging to decay”) stay coherent. One scaffold trace: “Each dawn… each Friday” is template cadence but serves liturgical pacing. No loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences vary from rolling cadence to staccato gasp, propelling the ritual momentum. Figurative layer is dense yet purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no filler filters. Occasional alliterative clustering (“salt spray gnawed…slow exhale”) risks mannerism but stays subordinate to action. Zero loops or scaffold detected; clarity never buckles.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    High figurative density in every sentence; pattern is taught early and coherent, but in the climax (“pixel by pixel, melting into the funhouse floor like sugar in rain”) two mixed metaphors (pixel + sugar) create micro-logic clash. Paraphrase loops absent; no scaffold. Information density strong: one sentence often shows setting + metaphor + emotion. Filter verbs minimal. Final line lands cleanly, but figurative overload earlier keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: cadence mirrors wave crescents, no template runs. Metaphors stay coherent—clouds as sheet music, sea as xylophone—without mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“each note a question answered by the next”) is forgiven because it enacts restless euphony. Information density high; every sentence advances sonic alchemy or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances map, memory, or pressure. Mixed metaphors avoided; “spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs” is single coherent vehicle. Information density high: “etched them inside her reed whistle’s hollow chamber” does triple job (memory, code, concealment). No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density—“ticket-counter hollow known only to scholars who still believed archives could bleed” does three jobs in one clause. No loops; metaphors stay coherent (ivy/veins, rose/pretense). Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“calculated fabrication,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above spoken range but fits historian POV; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with tide: cascading prepositional clauses mirror silt swirl; staccato fragments mark surfaced breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent—“tiles shifting like teeth in a slack jaw.” One loop risk: “water…water” in adjacent lines, but cadence teaches pattern. No scaffold; every paragraph advances knowledge, image, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts”) and paid off in finale. High information density: “grain shipments rerouted before the flood—not for famine relief, but for elite stockpiles” compresses scandal in one line. No mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence often jobs—world rules, emotional state, metaphor. Rhythm varies: long hypotactic buildups crash into fragmentary launch countdown. No mixed metaphors; “wound turning in its sleep” sustains orbital metaphor. Zero loops, zero scaffold; “intangibly tangible” is earned paradox, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured, high-density; figurative language is selective (“glyphs shimmered like trapped constellations”) and tied to POV perception. Rhythm varies naturally; only minor template cadence in tripled participial openers early on (“kneeling…tracing… scanning”) but pattern is taught and fits observational tempo. No mixed metaphors; no synonym loops. Opening/final lines anchor and recharge motif of listening vs scanning. Occasional elevated phrasing (“brilliant dimness”) reads intentional to theme; does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layers serve pressure rather than stall. One minor loop: "salt and bile mingling / salt no longer clung" reprises 'salt' within three sentences without new pressure, costing a hair. Otherwise, strong verbs ("vomited into the surf," "tide tugged") and precise nouns carry double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentence for mist crawl, fragment-like exchanges for staccato tension. No loops, no mixed metaphors; information density high (“drawer pull…raw material”). One minor scaffold: “the point” after exposure statement could be cut, but it does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: every sentence layers image and motion. Occasional metaphor stacking (“salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations”) flirts with overwrite but stays pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; final third is clean, allowing the laugh line to snap.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless clauses for descent, staccato fragments for climb. High density—each sentence layers sensory + symbolic work without pad. Metaphors disciplined: “ripples…like heartbeats” sustained, no mixed vehicles. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice & stakes; final line resolves by image (“something glowing…alive in the dark”). Minor elevation—“turquoise like forgotten neon”—remains within POV’s plausible wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with purposeful inversion (“Not the devouring kind, but the kind that cradles seeds”). No paraphrase loops, but occasional modifier stacks near threshold (“paradoxically steady tremor… quieter, hungrier”). Metaphors stay coherent within fairy-tale physics. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and world data simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates from incantatory long sentences to the staccato of “She emerged. Breath ragged.” No loops or paraphrase stacks; each line advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within ink/vapor/weather logic. One mixed vehicle—“time curled like smoke around forgotten toys”—but it is brief and closure-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence music is controlled—varied cadence, strong verbs, zero paraphrase loops. One mixed metaphor (“lullaby made of rust and solar wind”) is permissible in lyric mode; it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so the read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density risks purple overload but stays purposeful because metaphoric vehicles (volcano purr, sugar-in-tea sternum) are re-used and pay off in the closing image. No scaffold loops; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphysics). One paraphrase slip—“glow synced with her heartbeat” echoes the earlier celestial waltz—barely dents clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, tool, and stake. Occasional poetic overlap (“sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies”) risks mixed-metaphor clutter but stays legible; no scaffold, loops, or filter stacks. Rhythm accelerates naturally as she slips below the sentries.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent within frictionless physics—gliding, polishing, mercury pooling—no mixed vehicles. High information density: ochre spirals, cobalt sigils, ash fractals each carry distinct sensory load without modifier bloat. Final line “future felt like a gift, not a sentence” is concise, propulsive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breathes with storm gusts; sentence length swells then snaps at crisis. Information density high—each line layers image + interiority + metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent “each” anaphora clusters verge on template cadence; not quite three, so −0.2 only. Metaphors coherent (storm as artillery, clouds as ink) and don’t blur causality. Clean grammar, pronoun tracking perfect; opening and closing lines are ear-perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from staccato (“He adjusted his cuff”) to lyrical elongation without drumbeat pattern; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent within clockwork lexicon—light as gear-tooth, shadow as ratchet—avoiding mixed-vehicle sludge. Information density high: one line can deliver sensory detail, causal clue, and character state (“the tilt of shadow at 10:17”). Minor scaffold: opening participial phrase “Sunlight fractured…” is the story’s only syntactic stall; momentum recovers immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “coffee tin with secret false bottom clinked... heavier tonight not with coins but with folded poems”). No loops or scaffold; each image advances. Figurative language purposeful—moon as liquid starlight paid off by wax pool. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraphs breathe with emotional cadence. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances physics or emotion. Metaphors are internally coherent—tidal arbor, wind-chords, starlight threads—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “petals of condensed vapor burst into prismatic spray” does atmospherics and causality in one breath. Final chord described as “a sound woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing” is the exact moment prose becomes music without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate, no template cadence. Figurative language is patterned (opal petals, firefly glyphs) and paid off in the luminous fractal ridge. One paraphrase loop—“verified,” “consistent,” “contextually anchored”—is intentionally ritualistic, not sloppy scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity stays intact through peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Figurative density is high but patterned: salt-laced wind, cerulean regret, silt-settling voice—taught early and paid off, so penalty waived. Information density strong: one sentence often sets scene, reveals lore, and advances ritual. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence rhythm modulates with ritual pace. Only micro-slip: “color — a deep, bruised indigo bleeding upward, swirling like ink in milk” stacks two metaphors in one line, but clarity survives.

Closure beat (“The song wasn’t finished. / Neither was she”) avoids scaffold, landing with rhythmic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“ink bleeding into whispers of forgotten law”). Sentence rhythm modulates masterfully—staccato during tension (“He couldn’t bury it. Couldn’t ignore it.”), fluid in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (light = memory = signal). Minor deduction only for slight over-density in two mid-story sentences (“Distress signals… harmonic tremors…”), but clarity never falters, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “baskets woven from reeds and stubborn hope” does triple duty. Figurative language is precise (“hunger followed like a shadow”) and never muddled. One minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-story (three within five lines), creating minor rhythmic drag—but not in closure. Final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless, each sentence advancing image, theme, and momentum without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)

Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—soil remembers blood, dust dances like pollen—and never muddles causality. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., “She stepped into the vault.” as standalone beat). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting: “Each step cracked the earth. Each breath carried spores.”

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“She worked while cells divide… tracking mitosis like a ticking clock”) and varied rhythm that breathes with scene needs. Figurative language is coherent (forge burns “absences,” aurora “chimed like frozen bells”) and pattern-taught early. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“marrow-deep instinct,” “alchemy of grief”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mars peak beats. Final paragraph’s clarity and cadence perfectly resolve the sensory buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (thawing = transformation) and payoff-rich (“rainbow shards now danced on metal”). Minor overwriting in mid-text (“drama lends dignity to drudgery”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beats remain clean. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; syntax varies purposefully (fragments for ritual, complex sentences for reflection). Final paragraph’s “weightless gravity” crystallizes theme without purple excess—high information density sustained to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (whispers, tides, rust) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “velvet-wrapped poison” risks slight abstraction, but it’s anchored by immediate context. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Final line (“salt and second chances”) perfectly resolves the opening’s celestial melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense but never muddled; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) and payoff-perfect. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“honeyed resin trapping ancient breath”) slightly slows momentum, but closure beats are lean and luminous.

No scaffold or register drift; read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “liquid stars,” “light bleeding sideways,” “resonant hush” avoid cliché through specificity. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/refraction motifs) and pays off in the lens’s silver circle. Minor overwriting in “marrow-vibrating” hush slightly blurs physical logic, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent lines near climax (“No one spoke. No one needed to.”) verge on paraphrase-loop—prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (marbles as memory, vines as rebellion) and pays off in closure (firefly spirals).

Figurative language is pattern-taught (truth as mass/gravity/breath) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “alpine rage” and “auroral sorrow” slightly strains, but rhythm varies purposefully—short staccato beats during action, longer cadences in reflection. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “flashlight trembling... not from fear but from the drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep” establishes voice, mood, and embodiment in one stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language (“runes grown like roots,” “screaming numbers”) is coherent and grounded in the story’s logic. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“procedural spiral of staircases… labeled with dates”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s propulsion—“The remaining echoes rushed toward her”—lands with earned velocity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“rawhide stretched taut over hollow bellies” conveys both setting and metaphor). Figurative language is coherent—vibrations “trembling up her spine,” melodies “dissolving like sugar in cold tea.” Zero loops or scaffold; final line (“The world, reversed, ready to be felt”) echoes opening without redundancy. Minor deduction for slight overuse of em-dashes in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph lengths mirror pacing (longer in reflection, fragmented in tension). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The line “solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it” exemplifies compression with thematic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “faceted like frozen tears” conveys form, emotion, and motif. Figurative language is coherent—light, glass, and scent metaphors interlock without contradiction. Minor overwriting in glyph description (“curling indigo,” “jagged sapphire stroke”) borders on ornamental but serves closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally to mirror emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and theme (“fibers whispering of panic and grit”). Figurative language is coherent: rope as archive, time as weave, light as stitch. Minor overwriting in “auroras humming hymns older than language” slightly strains physics, but pattern is taught early (“whispering fibers”) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-revelation gasp).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the world doesn’t scream—it sighs” establishes tone immediately. Figurative language is pattern-taught (sound as ghost, silence as canvas) and paid off in the bowl’s ripples naming the dead. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ghost of song—unfinished, aching, alive”) slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“the unfinished, once more, begins to sing”) earns its simplicity through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (amber, static, breath) and never muddled. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“silver storm beneath her ribs” borders on purple), but rhythm varies effectively and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; the closing image (“silence, thick and sweet as amber”) recharges the opening motif with earned weight. One near-redundancy (“lighter and heavier all at once”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with dual-purpose lines (“compassion, once received, now given”) and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting appears in “salt-kissed air” and “constellations blinked like distant signal lamps,” but these serve atmosphere without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or texture. Final paragraph’s cadence—listing sounds of community—propels closure without redundancy, though one could argue “wave after wave, tide after tide” slightly over-echoes earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “quartz branches dripped liquid light onto moss that glowed like drowned constellations” advances setting, theme, and mood in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm varies naturally (fragments for tension, cadenced clauses for myth-making). Figurative language coheres—reeds, light, webs recur without strain. Minor overwriting in “wind through cracked bells” (slightly mixed register), but clarity at closure remains unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose maintains high information density: “uncaging moments—not freeing them, but releasing them from stasis” compresses philosophy into action. Figurative language is coherent (echoes as mercury, time as sculpted clay) and never muddled in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “ferromagnetic tape reel fragment” conveys era, materiality, and fragility in three words. Figurative language is purposeful (“fit in her palm like a broken promise”) and coheres physically (light/stained glass motif). Minor artifact: slight synonym churn in “relics that whispered of lives interrupted” / “sensory echo—a laugh, a sigh,” but no loops or scaffold dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, though one overloaded sentence (“She closed her eyes and heard…”) borders on density excess without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally—staccato during hesitation, flowing in surrender. Minor overwriting in “liquid circuitry” risks purple prose but serves closure. No loops or scaffolding; high information density (“moss swelled with absorbed sorrow”) avoids abstraction. Final line’s “keeping time with her breath” masterfully echoes opening droplets.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “the tide forgets to leave,” “grief becomes legacy,” “calcifies into artifact” each pull double duty. Sentence openings vary (“She’d found it…”, “After the water wars…”, “One night…”), and paragraph lengths mirror emotional rhythm. One minor flaw: slight over-reliance on figurative density in the opening paragraph (“glowing like a trapped sunset,” “silver veins”) risks purple prose, but it’s taught early and pays off in the brooch’s fractal shadows. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is consistent (light as woven moonlight, shadows like ink in water) and never contradictory. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“woven moonlight”) that edges toward abstraction, but closure remains sharp and unobscured. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“salt like forgotten prayers,” “trust accrue like tide-silt”) and pays off in closure. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (e.g., staccato list of offerings vs. flowing description of the scroll). Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in one high-pressure beat (“harbor breathe differently”), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist clung like regret,” “starlight pooled like liquid mercury” avoid purple excess by serving character perception. Minor overwriting in mid-descent (“corridors where mist clung like regret and starlight pooled…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence (“not away, but toward”) recharges the opening hour motif with earned certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “graphite ghosts of eras that never were” conveys history, medium, and ontology in six words. Rhythm varies purposefully—cadence slows at dawn pauses, accelerates during transcription. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (hum as “carrier wave,” notepad as “quilt”). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in Theta variant description, but closure image (“trees bent branches... shield the notepad”) remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “his pulse thrumming defiance beneath cold paper” merges character, setting, and conflict. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors or purple excess. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tidal ebb/flow.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes (“iron bones slick with dew,” “sigh of a frayed wire”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/water motifs recur with evolving function) and never muddled. Zero loops or scaffold—no synonym churn, repetitive stems, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s cadence (“listened—to the rails, the tide, the silent gratitude”) resolves opening’s “predawn hush” with earned resonance, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “wings slicing the brittle air,” “condensation blooming in fractal reply.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (water as memory, language as thermodynamics) and pays off. Minor overwriting in “star-stung dark” slightly jars, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“stops editing—and starts witnessing”) lands with earned weight. High information density—every line advances character, theme, or method.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is coherent (“vibration traveled up her arm like a root seeking water”) and purposeful, never purple. Sentence openings vary organically; paragraph lengths mirror the story’s pulse—short during precision, flowing during revelation. One minor slip: “wild hush” appears twice, but the second use reweights it as “presence holding its breath,” transforming repetition into resonance rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“statues of faceless deities stared blindly into abyssal dark, their stone robes frozen mid-flow as if caught fleeing some ancient cataclysm” conveys setting, history, and mood). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“surgical grace,” “lonesome splendor”) slightly thickens texture but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp. One paraphrase near-miss (“unsnnarl the knotted timelines… unsnarl violence into stillness”) avoids redundancy through conceptual escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“air tasted of brine and candle wax, thick with ghosts of confessions never absolved”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“wind gnawed,” “groaning like a throat”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic stasis. One paraphrase risk (“fractured glow” / “fractured light”) but not repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and high information-per-line, though occasional overwriting appears (“ashen-veil ghost bride drifted, not as a specter of sorrow, but as a lovingly venomous echo”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences mar momentum, and rhythm varies skillfully. However, the phrase “lovingly venomous” borders on label-speak without immediate embodied contradiction, and one mixed metaphor (“glass cathedral of eternal twilight”) slightly muddles the physical logic. These minor artifacts prevent a 9+ but don’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose maintains high information density: “shipwreck silk and whale-song echoes” conveys history, material, and loss in six words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fractures → filigree, silence → heavy garment) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor overwriting in “rebellion dressed in lace” slightly dilutes propulsion, but rhythm varies purposefully—long sentences for atmosphere, short for action (“She didn’t pause.”). Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, setting, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“soil from three continents beneath her nails” establishes backstory economically). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“roots like fingers,” “time bent like roots”) and pays off in closure’s “roots remembering their purpose.” Minor overwriting in “petals fell upward” risks physics violation, but the orchard’s sentience cues altered reality early. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “ticker tapes long silent, pneumatic tubes now decorative” conveys era, loss, and irony in one breath. Figurative language is consistent (mail as sacred ritual, arcade as cathedral) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “ghosts of analog commerce” is offset by propulsion elsewhere. Zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat (“drawn—with care, with chalk…”) lands with rhythmic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful (e.g., “needle flashing like a comet’s tail” → “silver filament drawn from the candle’s own wick”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor density in high-pressure beats (flame shudders described twice) costs 0.3, but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose avoids loops/scaffold: every sentence advances atmosphere (“aerial roots tightening like fingers around time itself”) or character (“ink blurred by tears”). Figurative language is coherent—moonlight “stitches fractures with threads of silver resolve”—and never muddled in peak beats. High information density: “wax that cracked like frozen regret” conveys emotion, object state, and theme simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “spectral touch” burns, but no artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ghost-pressure of ocean tides,” “fractured radius and the unbreakable stare.” Figurative language is coherent (coral = memory, mist = ghosts), though “lotus-hearted ache” risks abstraction. Minor overwriting in “brain coral fragment... humming with ghost-pressure”—two sensory verbs (“humming,” “pulsed”) slightly blur focus. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Final line (“carry it with grace”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light as paint, fog as emulsion) and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully (e.g., fragmented climax: “amber laughter, cerulean whispers”). Minor overwriting in one beat (“bubbling sound that startled birds…”) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“grief made basslines brittle, joy turned treble to dust”). Figurative language is coherent: sound becomes shape, scent, story without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths modulate breath. Closure line (“waiting, in the pause between question and reply”) recharges the opening with earned resonance—no overwriting, no artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense but propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “glass panes rattled with the converging chaos of winged things and whispering vines” establishes setting, tone, and threat). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “cathedral of chitinous observation” slightly slows momentum, but rhythm recovers swiftly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“each link calibrated not just for distance but for memory”) and varied rhythm that mirrors the volcano’s breath. Figurative language is coherent—stone ribs as leviathan skeleton, chain tension as tuning fork—and never muddles clarity. One minor artifact: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-section, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s dappled-light metaphor crystallizes resolve without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose achieves high information density: “dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets” establishes setting, character lens, and theme in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (motes as alphabets → sheet music → applause) without muddle; meteorite “humming with cosmic solitude” pays off in pigeon trills. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She had reinvented...”, “Every dawn...”, “One humid Tuesday...”). Minor overwriting in “cracked open Elara’s ribs like a music box” risks purple prose but earns its place by embodying cost—ribs as instrument housing resurrected melody.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but precise—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (rainbow mist, fossilized grief) and pays off in the final unfolding. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“regret with teeth,” “soul overcast”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph achieves perfect cadence: “brushing sawdust… stepped off… dissolving… creaked once.” Zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose maintains high information density: “algae-slick corridors as if reading braille maps of drowned constellations” advances setting, character, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (thresholds, seam-light) without muddle; rhythm varies naturally to match pressure (slow exhale vs. comet-streak scattering). One minor density slip—“shadowseam wonder” slightly abstract—but immediately grounded by “beauty stitched into fracture.” Zero loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“salt-crusted skin,” “kelp-paper,” “moon-kelp pouch”).

One slight density excess: “serenading monotony until it sang back” edges toward abstraction but is grounded by preceding concrete acts.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but rarely overwrought; most figurative language serves propulsion (“sweat traced silver rivers,” “petals trembling as if taking dictation”). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“gravitational sighs and stellar sighs”) risks redundancy, but closure remains clear. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with action. One paraphrase-loop near climax (“stanzas of longing, refrains of resilience, couplets spun…”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure cause.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose achieves high information density: “fracturing dawn’s gold into spectral shards that danced across wet stone” merges action, image, and theme. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Pearl Bay at dawn...”, “He had come...”, “This was his method...”). Figurative language remains coherent (light as ledger, hulls as stories). Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“noctilucent reckonings”) that risks abstraction but is immediately grounded in vibration and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“trembling halos,” “liquid dawn,” “quiet architecture of what-might-be”) and avoids paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates during the mirror revelations then softens at departure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“stories burn twice”) and paid off (“turning its embers into light”). No loops or scaffold; even complex metaphors (“velvet fog,” “meteor hush”) remain coherent. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the veteran anecdote, which risks summary—but it’s redeemed by the brush-sweeping gesture that embodies his ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves high information density (“knotting air with intention,” “pollen into soil”) with rhythmic variety, though occasional over-compression risks opacity (“interrupted cadence made visible, audible, sacred”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (flight/ghosts/memory). Minor deduction for one near-purple passage (“velvet dark of collective amnesia”) slightly blurring clarity, but closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ritual’s pace.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “snowmelt ardor,” “twilight trapped in metal,” “rope remembers” each pull double duty. Sentence rhythm modulates with ritual phases—measured during casting, fluid at climax. One minor density risk: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the middle section, but pattern is taught early (“hollow gods for hollow temples”) and pays off in the helix’s emergence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivory-choked vents,” “logic fraying like old rope,” “slow detonation” avoid purple excess. Sentence openings vary (“She had descended…”, “The storm’s first thunder…”, “Visions surged…”), and paragraphs shift rhythm purposefully.

Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, especially in the multilingual incantation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but rarely overwrought; most figurative language serves dual purposes (e.g., “bruised moon” evokes color and emotional residue). Minor redundancy appears in adjacent lines (“She did not reject these memories. / She modified them”), and “synaptic plasticity” borders on label-speak, though quickly dramatized. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts align with emotional beats.

Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat (“silence was enough”) lands with resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“sunlight fractured… casting prismatic shards” establishes setting and foreshadows revelation). Figurative language is controlled—mechanical arm as “siege engine,” silence as “fencing”—without muddle. Minor overwriting in “dignified chaos” description slightly slows momentum, but rhythm recovers during the 11:03 climax. Zero loops or scaffold; information density peaks when the shadow aligns with the fissure, merging action, theme, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every line multitasks (e.g., “moon slipped past the last jagged tooth” conveys time, setting, and fracture imagery). Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (seeds, molting, cathedral). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (“wax pooled like liquid starlight”) is pattern-taught and payoff-justified. Sentence variety avoids monotony; paragraph cuts serve emotional charge (e.g., short punch: “The wind didn’t snuff it.”). No scaffold or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“petals of condensed vapor burst into prismatic spray” shows effect and beauty). Figurative language is coherent—music bends gravity, emotions conduct physics—and avoids purple overload. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “strategically creative” exposition, but peak beats (“slammed down a chord that didn’t exist”) are clear and visceral. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully from languid to staccato.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “petals that shimmered like liquid opal—each one a whisper of forgotten truths” does triple duty (image, theme, setting). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“empirically whimsical”) and pays off in the fractal ridge. Minor overwriting in “luminous doubt” description slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm crystallizes closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “salt-laced wind combing through wet grass as if smoothing the ruffled edges of time” establishes tone, setting, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tides, roots, color gradients) and pays off in closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“bruised indigo bleeding upward, swirling like ink in milk”) slightly slows propulsion but serves thematic saturation. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies purposefully to mirror ritual cadence.
