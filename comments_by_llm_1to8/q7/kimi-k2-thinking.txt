    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "decay revealed itself through accumulated dust patterns" in paragraph 8 restates the concept already shown in paragraphs 4–7. The phrase "preprocesses reality" recurs four times without functional variation, creating template cadence. "Needless drama" appears three times in similar constructions. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems. The final third maintains clarity and propulsion, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "The canyon remained quiet, the stars above echoing his quiet resolve" / "quiet canyon under stars" / "In the quiet of his workshop"; "luminous glass artist" appears four times, "drifting resonance" three times, "scorched testament" four times without reweighted meaning each mention. Sentence stems repeat: "He [verb]" openings cluster in the final third. Stock phrases—"newfound clarity," "beacon of truth," "testament to resilience"—appear in closure beats, dulling specificity. The frost-to-ledger code and vessel-shaping lack concrete procedural detail, relying on summary ("shaped it into a vessel") rather than showing hand, heat, or material resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose carries clarity and purpose, but several patterns recur: "She had," "She believed," "She placed" across adjacent beats create template cadence; "unshaken marvels" appears three times with diminishing freshness; "silently expressive" is used twice as label. The metaphor "heat-mapping emotions" is repeated but never dramatized in micro-detail—we see the results (colors) but not the perceptual act itself. The final paragraph stacks several summary moves ("no longer a void," "a canvas," "a space," "a cathedral") that could condense. Minor filter-verb clusters ("She watched," "She saw") dull immediacy in the middle third. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, label/phrase loops −0.4, summary drag in closure −0.5; total −1.5, routed here per artifact policy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and most lines advance pressure. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and elevated diction clusters: "not quite breathing, not quite drowned" echoes "not quite fish, not quite human"; "the stillness they sought remained chased" is restated in "their own chased stillness" two paragraphs later. Template cadence appears in runs of "They were..." and "The undertaker..." openings across adjacent paragraphs. Stacked metaphors in the final third ("through the depths like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself") muddle rather than sharpen. These artifacts touch but don't fully obscure the closure, resulting in −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The bell's chime… the bell's tone… the bell's gentle chime"; "quiet declaration… quiet resolve… quiet pride"; "gently persistent" recurs without variation. Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "The [noun] would [verb]" and "Mara [verb], her [noun] a [metaphor]" across six beats. Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "heartbeat," "beacon," "canvas," "threads weaving through hearts" in close proximity. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems; −0.4 for figurative density without payoff. Information density is low—many sentences restate thematic claims rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops appear throughout: "unused love" is restated across at least six lines without advancing pressure; "breath/breathing/breathed" recurs in template-like stems ("Her breath steadied," "She breathed them in," "each breath a spark"). Figurative density is high but often generic ("fireflies," "embers," "storm of feeling") without sharp vehicle logic. The final third contains multiple restatements of the healing and release, flattening momentum. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, totaling −1.1; artifacts touch closure, so cap at 7.7 before applying, landing mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies, but several beats loop conceptually: "texture of time" appears four times, "fading photograph" six times, "hyperbolic geometry" thrice—often without added pressure. "The halo fragment" and "living bridges" are restated in adjacent lines with synonym churn. High figurative density in every paragraph obscures momentum; metaphors occasionally mix ("opened like a wound" followed by "retrocognitively trapped" feels register-adjacent but not coherent). Paraphrase loop: "treating each fading photograph as a coordinate" is immediately followed by "align the garden's growth patterns with the fragment's temporal frequency"—both describe her theory without new information. Template cadence in the disintegration sequence: "Her body began disintegrating... each cell unfolding... The living bridges absorbed... her memory becoming... Fading photographs now included..." Baseline −0.6 for loops and churn; −0.4 for template stems; total −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops damage momentum: "chained at the ankle...still chained but triumphant...still chained," "promise of resilience...promise of new life," "his heart a steady drum, his mind a map of hope...his heart a compass, his chains a map." Template-cadence runs appear in the final third ("He knows...He imagines...He knows"). Figurative density in low-pressure moments (carousel horses, phantom archer, "melodic chime," "green rebellion") reads as ornamental overwriting. Stock metaphors ("his mind a calm ocean," "his heart a compass") flatten the closure beats. Cumulative artifact penalty (loops + template stems + stock figures): −1.2 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and largely coherent: "cathedral of rust and salt," "memory becoming a medium," "wind through a ribcage." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Two frictions lower the score: (1) Near-paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"ashen forge," "forge's heart," "forge had gone cold," "forge reignited"—cycling through synonym variants without added pressure. (2) Several metaphors stack in single sentences ("wound that wouldn't clot," "whine like glass screaming underwater," "hollow note singing through the orchard like wind through a ribcage"), creating momentary density without always clarifying causality. No line-level opacity that obscures closure, so penalties remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "illuminated moments" recurs nine times, "luminous disbelief" four times, "destiny's door" five times, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure or detail. Runs of "She [verb]" stems (lines 11–14, 20–23, 28–31) create drumbeat rhythm. The moonbeam-pouring sequence (lines 21–27) cycles through metaphor (silver thread, glow, pulse) without causal linkage—each sentence restates enchantment rather than advancing it. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "realized") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy. Core information density is low; many lines do decorative work (e.g., "the emerald station by moonlight stood silent, its tiled walls reflecting a mosaic of light and memory") without altering knowledge or choice. Grammar and tense are clean, but clarity suffers from synonym churn and scaffold repetition across adjacent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "He'd stopped blowing glass for a year, until he realized that fire was the only thing that understood frost" delivers backstory, metaphor, and turning point in one beat). Clarity is generally strong. Deductions: minor filter-verb stack in reflective passages ("had become," "had been," "had long ago replaced"); the phrase "weighty lightness" and "ordinary alchemy" read as slightly strained oxymorons rather than earned paradox; light scaffold in "He understood that..." which could trust image alone. No major loops or template cadence; propulsion remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and spatial choreography tracks clearly across beats, but the prose carries template cadence and synonym loops: "trembling" recurs four times, "whisper/whispering" five times, and scaffold phrases ("she forced herself," "she felt the weight") appear without added pressure. Metaphors occasionally blur—"dome…seemed to watch" then "seemed to breathe"—and the final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("cracks in armor…circuits of strength," "map of hope") that reduce information density. The decryption beat is summarized rather than shown, missing an opportunity for line-level specificity that would anchor the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "ambered hush" recurs six times with synonym variants ("marbled hush," "silence"), and "endless night" appears eight times without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("The oracle… The traveler… The fort…" openings across 12 paragraphs). Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt the hum") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but often mixed ("silence pressed like amber," "map a constellation of quiet"). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and no major loops or scaffolding appear. The opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, figurative language saturates many high-pressure beats without consistent payoff: "spectral ribbons," "bruised purple," "cascade of recursive moments," "living circuit," "endless symphony." While individually clear, the density of metaphor in the loop sequence (statues turning heads, glyphs forming, recursive moments) creates register drift that elevates diction beyond immediate sensory pressure. Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "each tick mirroring," "each loop was not," "each string a timeline, each bow stroke a decision." Apply −0.6 for figurative density in peak beats and −0.4 for template stems, totaling −1.0 within Q7 per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythms vary and prose is grammatically clean with no major loops. However, numerous lines restate content without adding pressure: "She realized these marks were a silent map" immediately followed by "The numbers matched the timestamps…a record she had meticulously kept"; "The truth, once spoken, lifted a weight" then "Elara felt a quiet freedom, as if the honesty had opened a door." The final five paragraphs cycle through synonyms for transparency and trust—"resonant hush," "words…unnecessary," "unspoken language"—creating a thematic echo chamber that dulls momentum. Information density is moderate; many beats do two jobs (advancing plot and reiterating theme), but closure beats repeat rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops erode momentum: "Each cracked marble, he mused, was a broken promise" restates the established metaphor without new pressure; "The garden maze, with its intertwining paths, now held a story" summarizes closure instead of enacting it. Synonym churn ("withered," "fading," "waning") clusters without functional distinction. Stock phrases ("pulse of the garden match his own heartbeat") and filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he mused," "he told them") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third cycles through thematic restatements, violating the loop/scaffold screen and triggering artifact penalties that touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong rhythm and varied sentence openings throughout. Information density is high in most beats. However, figurative language clusters heavily in the second half without always clarifying: "violet flower opening in the aether, its petals made of twisted spacetime and forgotten memories" stacks metaphors; "migratory paths crossing through time itself like threads in a cosmic tapestry" adds another vehicle. "Icy warmth" appears three times as a phrase or concept (final mention: "her voice carrying an icy warmth"). Minor paraphrase between "her theory was true" and "Proving that time moves sideways." No major loops or template cadence, but density of ornament in peak beats triggers −0.4 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with lyric texture, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in the note sequence ("The first note... The second note... The third note...") without taught pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops: "amid the hush of unstruck chords" recurs verbatim three times; "in between spaces" appears six times, some ornamental. Mixed metaphor: water as "tide of forgotten melodies" clashes with "water damage creating images" as mechanical process. Register drift: "spectral diagrams," "temporal pockets," "code fulfilled" elevate diction beyond the visceral scene. Figurative density is high throughout without clear escalation or pattern. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: loops and template runs total −0.8 in Q7; slight register drift adds −0.3. Information density is moderate; some beats ("lately inspired," "wordless conversation") repeat without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "weight of a swallowed truth" appears eight times, "swaying certainties" four times, "auroral sorrow" five times, often across adjacent lines restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.8 for loops). Template cadence runs ("She realized… She decided… She believed… She traced… She recalled… She understood…") flatten momentum in the middle third (−0.5). The final paragraph summarizes the oracle's release across multiple sentences that could be condensed, and several beats (the smudge, the scale, the fade) are narrated twice without new information.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("truth had mass," "silence grew heavier," "swallowed truths clogging his chest," "confession booths," "memory's mass"), creating a cumulative lyric texture but verging on overwriting in peak beats. Several paraphrase loops: "swallowed truth" recurs in slight variations across five paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("The radio shrieked… Elias's fingers found… He twisted slowly…") flattens momentum. No major grammar or clarity breaks, but the metaphor load and repetitive stems merit −0.6 under the artifact screen.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs 20–21 restate the drift/archive theme, paragraphs 27–28 loop the swan's lesson without added detail. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" stems and repeated phrase anchors ("drift of untold seasons," "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace"). Figurative density in every sentence without escalation or payoff ("breathing organism," "silent archive," "quiet vigil") obscures propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and template artifacts; −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in multiple beats; total deduction ~−1.2, baseline mid-6 drops to 5.4.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language ("notes worn smooth by generations," "thread of breath pitched perfectly") is vivid but occasionally overwritten without pattern-teaching. The phrase "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" recurs five times, functioning as a lyric anchor but bordering on template cadence. Minor paraphrase loops: "gentle inevitability of a key turning in a lock it was born to fit" and "some connections ran deeper than consciousness" restate the same idea. Sentence openings vary and clarity is maintained. The final paragraph stacks summary rather than landing on one charged image, diluting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often evocative ("pages charred at the edges like moth wings," "scraped away the sky's familiar constellations"), but some metaphors stack without adding pressure: "the bronze quiet held its breath, dreaming of dragons" in the final line layers three abstractions. Minor scaffold appears: "sensitively perceptive" repeated verbatim twice, and "the stories walls have heard" recurs as a label without variation. Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high in the discovery beats. Overwriting in the final third—particularly the clustering of figurative language—dulls propulsion slightly (−0.5). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"finger pointing at guilty stars," "bleach the future from her bones," "spaces between words," "orchestrate... by directing flow"—and while most images serve the theme, the accumulation occasionally slows momentum in non-peak beats. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood now" is a tell-summary that could be cut, and "the open secret of the island's espionage past" loops the "open secret" motif without added pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally strong, with most lines doing double duty. No major loops or template cadence runs, but the prose leans toward ornament in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and sentence rhythm varies, but figurative language clusters heavily in the first half without pattern-teaching ("decorating the air with unasked questions," "a rhetorical device sharp enough to cut assumptions," "a secret so long held it had calcified into silence"). Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "She dipped... decorating," "She pressed... began to play," "She looked... now seeming." Several lines restate concepts adjacently ("stillness wasn't peace—it was a wound dressed in quiet, a secret so long held it had calcified into silence"). These accumulate to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is grammatically clean, but pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "She had become the conductor of unheard symphonies" appears verbatim or paraphrased across four separate beats, and "mirrored horizon" recurs without added pressure or detail. Stock metaphors ("frost," "fog," "river," "baton of light") cluster in adjacent lines without coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence ("She [verb], [object]") runs through the balcony sequence, and figurative density in the climax (spiral/architecture/harmonies/cascade) blurs rather than sharpens the image. Apply −0.8 for loops and metaphor muddle; escalate to −1.2 for artifact spread into the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured timelines folded," "timelines began to collapse," "timelines stitched themselves"; "procedural generation" appears six times with near-identical framing. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" openers across a dozen lines). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("knot of being," "blueprint of her dissolution"). Figurative density in most sentences of peak beats (lines 17–30) with no pattern-taught payoff triggers −0.7. Patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock strings) totals −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure (final third), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences across high-pressure beats ("cocoon of echoing quiet," "fissures spreading like ice on a warming lake") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density overload (−0.5). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "her numbness finally defeated" / "her heart no longer a silent drum" / "found her song" restate the closure three times without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs through the middle (she accepted, she placed, she closed, she felt, she opened) without variation (−0.4). Information density suffers; many lines do two jobs (image + emotion claim) but momentum stalls in the resolution summary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity and sentence variety are present, but template cadence and paraphrase loops appear throughout: "after being followed home" repeats verbatim twice; "He knew…but…" structures recur; "The story of the storm recorder, the pigeon, and the courtyard would be told in whispers" reads like meta-commentary scaffold. Figurative language clusters without pattern payoff: "letting the stillness settle over him like a second skin," "the layered tranquility," "a melody of defiance." Elevated diction ("credibly curious nature," "intuit a deeper truth") in reflective beats drifts from the observational voice established in the opening. No major causality breaks, but line-level momentum sags under repetition and ornament, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He could use it to climb...Alternatively, he could weave the rope..." "The poet's heart thrummed...The poet's hands moved..." "Each note uncovered a layer...each pause a silence..." Stack of "he [verb]" and "The poet [verb]" constructions across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "ghost of a prisoner's grip," "silver threads that seemed to tug," "quiet fire that drove his fingers." Register drift into workshop-speak ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") clashes with the roadside-poet frame. Apply −1.4 for clustered artifacts; −0.3 for paraphrase loops. Total deduction pushes below mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage momentum: "chronic hush" appears eight times with minimal variation; "unfinished" recurs in adjacent lines without added meaning; "echo," "whisper," "silence," and "song" rotate mechanically. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" opens nine paragraphs, and "The [noun]" opens six more. Stock metaphors ("crack between silence and song," "thread that unbinds") and filter-verb stacks ("She feels," "She sees," "She imagines") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third dissolves into summary ("she will continue," "they will gather") without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is lyric and imagistic with clean grammar and varied paragraph structure. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "half truth/truths" appears thirteen times, "static electricity" seven times, "fuse insight with empathy" four times, often in adjacent or parallel constructions without added pressure. Sentences frequently open with "I" or "The," creating rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense ("honeyed light," "moth's wing," "borrowed heartbeats") but occasionally stacks without causal work, blurring momentum. The final third recycles "static," "borrowed," and "half truth" without reweighting them, resulting in conceptual redundancy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, preventing high-band entry and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Lena's motivation to uplift silent contributors sparked; she vowed to find the man" immediately follows the locket discovery without causal gap; "cycles of compassion" appears four times in formulaic stems. Figurative language stacks without tension: "breeze could carry their words," "starlit library," "melody of kindness played on." The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling, with synonym churn ("silent contributors," "unsung protectors," "quiet heroes") and a mechanical "and somewhere, a new envelope" coda. Filter-verb stacks ("Lena reflected," "she realized") dull immediacy in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during observation and shorter beats during action. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or theme. However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without always clarifying: "luminescent ache," "beautiful pain of roots taking hold," "heavy and bright" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Minor template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("The girl taught… how each… how the silence…"). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("kinship wasn't blood… but the dedication… the willingness") restates the same idea across two sentences. No major loops, but density occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally high, but figurative density is unrelenting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction without breathing room or pattern justification. "Liquid architecture," "temporal architecture," "borrowed currents," "compressed centuries" stack without variance in register or rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops: "interrupted cadence" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs; "the pendant's borrowed time" is restated as "borrowed time from the giant's deepening breath." Template cadence: "The giant had not stirred… Its exhalations created… its dreams leaked…" and "She needed to uncage… She needed to preserve…" use parallel stems. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for density and loop artifacts. Information density is high, but momentum drags during the tower ascent due to stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor in nearly every paragraph ("moon that had long since turned silver droplets into silent music," "fractal of grief and hope," "question mark etched in light"). While the lyric mode justifies some compression, the reliance on abstract philosophical constructions ("mathematics of emotion," "emotional equations") creates a veil between reader and concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear: "ambiguous loss" is restated multiple times without added pressure; "gentle" and "inventive" recur as labels. Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("She whispered… She could almost hear… She stood… She gathered… She left"). Information density is moderate—lines often layer image and atmosphere but advance situation incrementally. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags under the weight of ornament in the middle third. The final third tightens slightly as the doorway emerges and Vesper departs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally controlled ("the library's subbasement exhaled shadows like a lung filling with dusk"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, there are minor loops: "Sense memory was her language; touch was how she read the past" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure. The phrase "sapphire hush" recurs four times, creating slight fatigue. A few constructions feel templated: "She'd left a crayon there last week, and a blanket the week before" cycles through parallel structure without variation. No severe artifacts touch closure, but accumulation nudges the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths modulate with Elena's emotional state. Information density is solid in the trellis-repair sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reluctant metamorphosis" is named four times with minimal reweighting; "circuitously sincere" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. The final third stacks summary-like reflections ("Her study of plant behaviors had taught her," "she learned to sustain the transformation") that slow momentum. Stock metaphor "green blanket" and the line "her heart, too, had become a mossy trellis after rain" edge toward ornamental figuration without clear causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, but repetitive sentence stems ("She walked," "She offered," "She asked," "She understood," "She returned," "She felt," "She realized," "She would remain," "She closed," "She exhaled," "She smiled") create template cadence across a dozen lines, triggering a −0.5 deduction. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea: "the island itself was a canvas" / "the land remembered" / "the island was alive" loop without adding pressure. Figurative density is high ("the island seemed to pulse," "sky a bruised purple," "fingers rough," "swirl of amber and salt") but remains legible. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than story.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template-cadence runs pervade: "She [verb], [appositive modifier]" and "The [noun] was [modifier], a [metaphor] that [clause]" recur across 8+ lines without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops: "blind spot in her usually clear visions" / "a river of certainty, yet this arrival was a stone she had missed" restate the same content. Stock metaphors ("river of certainty," "beacon in the dark," "symphony of crystal pillars") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without payoff. Synonym churn: "forces," "unseen forces," "ancient forces," "entity" cycle without advancing sense. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("opened her hands, and the unseen forces flowed"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "She did not merely chronicle; she heartened..." immediately after "she demonstrated how each gap...revealed...intentional space"; "the spaces between them" / "the shape of what had been lost" / "meaning emerged...from what had been lost and then found in the gaps" cycles the same concept. Template cadence: nine sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" within two paragraphs, creating drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh tenor: "bottled starlight," "blanket of mist," "archives against the stones, writing." Figurative density in non-peak beats (ivory stones as blank pages, trumpet's ghost sounding shape) muddles rather than sharpens. Patterned-artifact penalty (paraphrase + template + stock strings) totals −1.2 in Q7, and presence in final third disallows 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "mist that smelled of ticket stubs and promises," "starlight pooled like liquid mercury." However, several lines approach overwriting without clear payoff: "a mind that saw musical notes in sewer grates and calligraphy in fire escapes" stacks metaphors decoratively. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 22–23 both assert the fortress holds unspoken truths using near-synonym phrasing ("every word the city had swallowed, every confession whispered" / "truths people buried beneath polite conversation"). Template cadence is mild but present in repeated "Her [noun]" openings. The Chinese characters "经纬度" are unexplained andread as a copy artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn permeate the text: "transcribed the tile's memories" / "transcribe the silent symphony," "unheard symphony" recycled across twelve lines, "courageously kind" / "courage of kindness." Template cadence runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" span most paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("his silence a heavy shroud," "grief could dissolve into starlight") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Figurative language density in non-peak passages ("ocean into a restless echo chamber," "entangled memories," "timeless lullaby") blurs clarity. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering disallow-9+ and high-band caps per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the climax carries stacked metaphor ("magnetic screams collapsed into profound silence," "refracted endings, infinite variations"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("the question that gnawed at her deathless core" / "the answer that had tormented her for millennia"). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" constructions. Register drift into technical language ("quantum signatures," "plasma's spin") clashes with the lyric mode. Figurative density obscures causal clarity at closure, triggering −0.7 penalty. Information density is high, but momentum suffers from ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm control and concrete imagery in peak beats: "breach of pure geometry," "cracks now maps of necessary fractures." Two paraphrase loops weaken mid-section: the "liquefies rigid thinking" concept appears three times with minor variation (embalming fluid metaphor, Sam's own rigidity dissolving, tissue compliance), and "deathly vitality" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the 2:47 AM heist paragraph: "Sam moved...finding...traced...understood" stacks actions without varied syntax. Information density is high overall, but the thematic repetitions cost momentum. No line-level opacity mars closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence: adjacent sentences restate the same content ("She recorded these spectral tales, pressing the textures of time into paper" / "In her battered notepad, she recorded these spectral tales"), and many lines open with "She [verb]" or "Each [noun]." Runs of "Each X represented Y" and "She imagined" constructions create rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, scaffold phrases ("the weight of," "a canvas, blank and infinite") dull momentum. Information density is low: multiple lines convey the same ritual without advancing knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character understanding or thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the poison-label recognition and slowing during the three-day vigil. Minor paraphrase loop detected: "filters reality differently" (paragraph 5) is restated as "filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making" (paragraph 39) without added pressure—this recurrence feels ornamental rather than pattern-taught. Some figurative language is dense ("sediment of stories—fragments that drift like tidal debris") but remains coherent. Sentence openings vary adequately. No grammar errors or pronoun confusion. The loop and elevated register in a few beats prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.9)
    Numerous paraphrase loops and synonym chains clog momentum: "retell/reimagined/retelling" appears across multiple beats without functional variation; "universal riddle" is restated five times with minimal reweighting; "ephemeral compass" and "closing pages" recur as thematic tokens rather than pressure points. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings flatten rhythm. Metaphor density is high but often self-contradictory (a seashell "cracked, releasing its compass" mixes vessel and instrument incoherently). Line-level clarity is acceptable, but scaffold and churn measurably dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with strong opening and closing images. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The "turpentine and hope" sensory blend is concrete and fresh. Minor artifact: "hopeful desperation" appears as a label in the opening and then again in the final paragraph as "hopeful desperation turning into determination," which edges toward thematic echo rather than embodied shift, but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies, and clarity is generally maintained, but template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third (five consecutive paragraphs open with "She [action]"), creating a mechanical march. Several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "The hourglass grain hung, suspended" followed by "with a silent slide, it fell" restates waiting-then-falling without added pressure. Stock lunar imagery ("blue-white gem suspended in the void," "speck of stardust") and elevated diction ("dawnlit melancholy," "the dawning hush finally broke") reduce specificity at peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (chemical setup, bloom description), but scaffold phrases ("She felt the weight," "She knew") pad interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high across the repair sequence. Minor loop: "feedback loop" (line 12) and "feedback into direction" (line 7) echo without added meaning. Slight overwriting in the opening paragraph: "tools hanging from ceiling hooks in a symphony of metal she knew by weight alone" stacks metaphor where concrete detail would propel faster. No clarity failures; propulsion is steady through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("dark comma against the white page of sky," "frost on iron," "phrasebook dog-ear fluttered in the draft") and mostly coherent. However, several beats loop conceptually: "He tracked beginnings" immediately follows "mapping what others called the end of the world. But Kael charted beginnings." The phrase "To find where the rivers begin" recurs five times with minor variation, creating paraphrase loops in the final third. The closure beat—"The bird passed through him like an idea through silence"—is evocative but mixed: can an idea pass *through* silence, or does silence absorb it? Accumulation of these artifacts across the final third triggers the patterned-artifact cap and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies across the piece, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Several strong images land: "moss grew in its cracks like old blood," "cobblestones remembered," "subsonic wave that traveled through the archway's stones." However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"The method was specific" followed by "The method worked like this" a few paragraphs later; "infinitely patient" repeated three times without variation; "he'd waited, infinitely patient, adjusting his own step" mirrors "For three centuries, he'd waited, infinitely patient." The middle section stacks filter-adjacent constructions ("he'd carved," "he'd waited," "he'd memorized") and template-cadence openings ("Kael stood," "Kael began," "Kael walked"). The figurative language is vivid but occasionally strained—"moss grew in its cracks like old blood" works, but "the wild hush of a forest before storm, of a held breath before song, of seven hearts beating out of time" stacks metaphors without unity. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats, but the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "The gathered hush had returned to its birthplace, but a fragment remained" is immediately echoed by "the vial...sat in his quarters, its crystal surface cool with the weight of all it had witnessed." Template cadence appears in cumulative "a [noun] for [noun]" constructions across adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "silence that tasted like salt and starlight" blurs sensory logic. Line-level debt in the closure zone disqualifies 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "copperlight repose" appears six times, "hush" nine times, "lattice" fourteen times, often in adjacent sentences without added detail or pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half: "The lattice began to vibrate… He placed the lattice… The lattice caught his words… the lattice glowed… the lattice left behind…" without syntactic variety. Stock metaphors ("thread a labyrinth," "chase hush," "stone altar held a single candle") lack specificity or fresh synthesis. Register drifts into abstract poeticism ("sustained the impossibility of truth within a lie") that clashes with the lighthouse-prison setting. Mixed metaphor: "The copperlight repose thickened, a heavy quiet that swallowed the echo"—light repose cannot thicken or swallow. Apply patterned-artifact pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing across the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "lovingly venomous whisper that both soothed and stung," "mournful elation of a story finally told," "sweet bitterness of a love that had finally found its rest." Mixed metaphors ("twist like lost souls seeking light") and stacked modifiers reduce clarity. Paraphrase loops cluster: "endless night" (line 1), "endless darkness" (line 24); "hush of winter-cracked fields" (lines 2, 13, 25). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The ghost [verb]" or "Elara [verb]." Figurative density in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5; paraphrase and stem loops add −0.6; total artifact debt ~−1.1. The closure beat ("orchard flourished, each fruit bearing…") is metaphorically cluttered, lowering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "haunting optimism" / "ghost-light" / "ghost chasing a fading dream"; "tide pools emptied" appears in five separate sentences. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs ("Each evening… Each night… One morning…"). Stock metaphors ("rose like old giants," "moon painted the canyon") and elevated register ("reverence," "solace," "luminous") flatten momentum. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile, obscuring causal links. The final third summarizes legend status in abstract terms rather than landing a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies, sensory anchors are vivid, and information density is generally high. However, multiple paragraphs in the second half begin with near-identical stems ("Lina saw," "Lina began to understand," "Lina realized," "Lina's faith," "Lina's heart") creating template cadence that dulls momentum during the turn sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs discussing the orchard as living archive and the sundial as mended continuity restate the same thematic content across three successive blocks without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "fragile ember" for faith. These artifacts do not obscure causality but flatten propulsion in the final third, triggering cumulative deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies across paragraphs and sentence structures are mixed (short declaratives, longer descriptive clauses). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "juxtapose" recurs in adjacent beats without adding pressure (lines 9, 10, 18); "meaning in the margins" cycles four times (lines 6, 16, 24, 26) with synonym churn rather than reweighting; "ebony clipboard" is mentioned in lines 1, 11, 22, 29 but treated as static anchor rather than evolving pressure. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions: "The arcade was… its holographic shopfronts… its physical awnings…" and "Each chalk mark was… each gap… each color…" The final third stacks thematic summary sentences ("The chalk would fade, but… The ebony clipboard felt lighter… The golden arcade began to wake…") that loop conceptually without propelling closure. Clarity remains high; no grammar or continuity breaks. Information density is moderate—lines often layer world-detail and mood but rarely do three jobs at once.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    Metaphor density is high throughout and many images contradict or blur ("leaves scraped like whispered secrets," "silence held its breath," "fabric became a tapestry of hidden maps"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "She stitched a secret star" / "each stitch a question posed" / "She stitched faster" / "she had stitched" recycle the same action without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("Mira believed... Mira felt... Mira understood..."). Line-level opacity and stock phrasing ("breath caught," "heart beat in time," "walked onward") dull the closure beat. Applying −1.2 for density/loop/template issues distributed across the text, including the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure. Information density is high in ritual beats (shard mechanics, condensation message). However, figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "the singing spirits swirled around us, their song a fierce tenderness that cradled my rage"). Stock metaphors appear: "voices like wind chimes," "cutting through my denial." Register drift into elevated diction ("the fierce tenderness") clashes slightly with the immediacy of the grief. Paraphrase loop: lines 21–22 restate the spirits' song without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density overload and minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high; most lines layer memory, sensation, and motif. Rhythm varies (short declarative "But the two are the same now" after longer spirals). Minor paraphrase loop: "translation is not about words but about carrying… He had carried too much" restates across two beats without added pressure (−0.3). Figurative language dense ("mist-clad," "banyan roots like unasked questions," "silence that grew teeth") but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "silence…grew teeth" then "archipelagos" shifts root metaphor slightly (−0.2). No template cadence or filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "She felt the lost joy returning, not as a memory, but as a living pulse" followed two lines later by "her heart swelling too, as the lost joy she sought became a shared breath." Template cadence dominates the middle: ten consecutive sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "Lyra [verb]," flattening rhythm during the re-creation sequence. Stock metaphors (fog "pooled like mercury," trees "rose like skeletal hands") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("pensive mirth," "fold of a daydream") dilute specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do advance action, but the final five paragraphs recapitulate closure effects already delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and thematic repetition pervade: "nested awakenings" appears six times, "pause between question and reply" three times, "methodically playful" twice, all without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphor: "shimmer and shift as if alive," "secret revealed in a dream within a dream." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat ("nested awakenings ripple through her own chest"). Apply −1.2 for spread and closure contamination, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character, conflict, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. However, several lines carry scaffold or purple flourishes: "cathedral of controlled chaos," "the familiar thrill of linguistic subversion," "the system was warping around him, tightening like a vine constricting its host." The phrase "candidly cryptic" appears twice in close proximity as both dialogue and narration, creating a paraphrase loop. The final paragraph's "concrete veins" and "rattle with the sound of freedom" push into overwrought metaphor. No causality breaks, but density wobbles under figurative load.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "blossom armistice" appears nine times with synonym churn ("petal peace," "treaty," "living armistice"); "shyly unstoppable" recurs four times; "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is repeated verbatim three times (−1.0). Template cadence runs in the final third: "For as long as… And so… And the…" (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("quiet tempest," "thread spun from moonlight") cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative density is high but coherence is mixed ("photosynthesize pain" is biologized metaphor strain). Total artifact penalty: −1.5, capping at 7.0 even if other elements were clean.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" appears verbatim or as near-synonym in six paragraphs; "deserted marvels," "foxglove regret," "gently systematic," and "echo of a long-forgotten song" recur as labels without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She knew…," "She resolved…," "She continued…") across the final third. The same core action—lighting orchids via song—is restated in paragraphs 8, 10, 15, 24, and 29 without propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "beauty laced with knowledge" (abstract) beside "crack of the bamboo, a mirror of her own imperfection" (concrete but contradictory vehicle). Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clarity is generally strong and sentence variety prevents monotony. Minimal loops or scaffolding. However, several phrases lean toward stock lyricism: "cathedral halls of memory," "broken trust unsnarled and rewoven stronger," "hidden harmony connecting every promise." The metaphor of "symphonies of truth" is repeated without evolving its meaning. Information density is high but the final third tells outcomes ("their futures waited on separate roads") rather than showing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language saturates many beats without pattern-teaching: "throbbed," "whispered of forgotten measurements," "coil around her palm," "dappled resolve," "lantern in the twilight." Mixed metaphors appear ("encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt") in peak beats, reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops: "The mountain breathed again" / "as the building breathes" restates the central image without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates. No template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "dust motes swirled" appears in four passages with synonym variation but no added pressure. Template cadence: "He [verb], [object]" runs across six consecutive beats mid-story. Stock metaphor stack: "blooming," "withering," "fragile," "echo" recur without reweighting. The final third cycles through "trusted," "preserved," "balanced" as abstract claims rather than concrete action. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (final pigeon release) obscures propulsion. Artifacts touch closure: −1.4 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence damage momentum: "necessary distances" rephrases across six lines without added pressure; "I [verb], the [noun]" stems repeat in adjacent sentences (lines 11–14, 34–37). Figurative language is dense but often mixed ("featherly determined, light as down yet unyielding as stone"). Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines are strong, but synonym churn ("fractured hush" × 3, "threshold" × 9) and stock phrasing ("memory of storms," "silent symphony") flatten peak beats. Artifacts span multiple paragraphs, triggering cumulative −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-stack rule applied to repeated stems.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense: "groaned like a dying leviathan," "fossil-memory of a bird that never existed," "suspended nebulae." However, the overwriting becomes a drag in high-pressure beats—stacked metaphors and elevated diction ("luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder," "galactic formations") flatten urgency rather than propelling it. Paraphrase loops appear: "rhythm of belonging" recurs across multiple paragraphs without advancing meaning. Several lines restate the same insight ("two rhythms becoming one," "synchronized with the city's heartbeat," "frequency became indistinguishable from the whole"). Template cadence in the middle section ("She followed," "She found," "She exhaled") and stock phrases like "ghost-maps" and "celestial zodiac" reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and concision are generally strong; sentence rhythms vary and information density is high. However, several lines repeat conceptual content: "the paths were not erased by malice but reclaimed by the sea's own memory" is immediately followed by "The sea, ever generous, gave back the memories it had collected." Template cadence appears in the opening run of "She spent… She needed… She resolved." Stock metaphors ("gnawed at her salt-soaked heart," "earth's glittering throat") cluster without payoff. The final paragraph stacks summary lines that restate the theme, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The argument dissolved into discussion" after "the diagonal interruption breaking their pattern" restates resolution. Template stems cluster: "He watched the chess game... He watched the couple... He watched Officer Chen..." Late in a key beat, this creates minor drag. The phrase "lightly attentive" recurs five times across 800 words, twice in adjacent paragraphs, reading as enforced prompt compliance rather than organic texture. Figurative language ("seabirds," "metronome," "canvas") is clear but occasionally stacks without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "memory could not be erased" / "memory is a tide" / "keep the cosmos alive in a world that had forgotten"; "living manuscript" / "parchment of the cosmos" / "canvas" recycle the same metaphor without progression. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens nine sentences in the final third. Stock phrases ("obsidian sky," "whispered secrets," "ancient galaxies") replace specific detail. Mixed metaphor: the garden is "manuscript," "parchment," "ink," and "canvas" within four lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("living poem," "bridge," "tapestry" in final paragraph). Penalty: −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant phrase recycling across the piece: "noctilucent reckonings" appears three times, "clear complexity" twice, "prism atrium in mist" three times, "reads between lines" / "read between the lines" twice, "before everything shifts" three times, "tempered pane" twice. Template cadence is pervasive—"He felt," "He sought," "He recognized," "He rose," "He walked," "He paused," "He taught," "He reminded"—across seven consecutive paragraphs in the second half. Mixed metaphor: "heart a tempered pane" (glass does not pump blood; the vehicle clashes with biological reality). These artifacts dull momentum and prevent entry to higher bands. Overwriting is present but not severe enough to trigger the maximum penalty; the loops and stems are the primary harm.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.7)
    Figurative density is high and unrelenting: "silver light pooled," "velvet sky," "ancient choreography," "tissue thin as rice paper," "polished smooth as river stones," "pack frame for the long carry of memory"—most sentences carry metaphor without pattern-teaching or earned payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster: "reflected deeply" / "reflecting deeply"; "translate pain" / "translate what they might carry" / "translated her pain"; "bargained innocence" / "bargain" repeated. Template cadence runs appear ("She'd chosen," "She'd spent," "She spoke," "She left," "She felt"). Artifacts touch closure beats ("illuminate," "enlighten," "enlightenments"). High-priority loop check fails; information density suffers under ornamental weight. Apply −0.6 baseline for template cadence, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.5 for figurative saturation in peak beats; total deduction ~−1.5, with artifacts in final third disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose maintains clarity across complex material. However, several beats display high figurative density without pattern payoff ("tide pool creature tasting different currents," "bloodstream of collapsing histories," "fibonacci sequence…punctuated by urchin spines"), and stock metaphor strings accumulate ("cathedral of limestone," "threads of beauty," "heartbeat of seventeen worlds"). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 5–6 restate Kael's "lucidly watchful" stance and decoration-pattern method without new pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she recognized") cluster in the final third. Template cadence emerges in the closing paragraphs with repeated "The [noun] had [verb]" stems. Apply −0.8 for combined artifact spread.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout: "sensitively perceptive" appears in seven beats, often in identical syntactic positions; "legacy's burden" and "half-burned diaries" and "film negative strip" recur as formulaic anchors without evolving imagery. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "She believed stone and plaster accumulated human intention" followed by "stone remembered everything, absorbed intention like a battery." Figurative language is stacked without pattern-teaching ("sonic fossils," "limestone accumulates bone," "heart a drum," "seed crystal"), creating density that slows rather than propels. Multiple beats open with "Mira + [verb]" or "The [noun]" in mechanical alternation. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template runs, with an additional −0.5 because artifacts appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate, though several beats paraphrase prior content without adding pressure (e.g., the mirrors' return is described twice, the painter's nature is restated in near-identical terms). Template cadence appears in the repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across the middle third. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks, and the figurative language (prism, mirage, borrowed heartbeat) is coherent. Overwriting is present but controlled; the closure image remains legible. Minor scaffold ("Some said… Others claimed…") adds texture without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and syntax supports the ceremonial tone. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere and stakes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "price of redemption" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure (−0.4), and several sentences open with template patterns ("He knew that...," "The negotiator...") creating mild cadence monotony (−0.3). Figurative language in peak beats (the hum, the glow) remains coherent but leans generic. No major clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the first two-thirds. However, the final third contains paraphrase loops: "the echo of the Aerion bird, released, seemed to sing" and "the note lingered in the museum's memory" restate the echo's preservation without added pressure. Template stems appear in clusters: "Vesper's foundation would…" / "Vesper would watch…" / "Vesper's story became…" across adjacent lines (−0.5). Minor filter-verb stack: "He imagined their faces" / "He imagined the Aerion's call" (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "fractured grace" recurs as a motif without becoming a crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and spatial choreography are strong; no pronoun confusion or time-line breaks. However, the prose carries pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching: "footsteps silent as memory," "melody that flattened dreams," "harvest of echoes," "threads of sound," "forgotten syllables," "spectral colors that painted her skin." In the climactic unlocking beat, metaphor stacks without concrete action—"arms weaving through cold air as if pulling invisible strings," "unwinding it from the prism's core"—obscuring the physical mechanics. Paraphrase loops appear: "her body moved with alarming grace" echoes "her bodily movements becoming increasingly poetic" and "her poetic body moving differently now." Template cadence runs in the final third: "She had…" opens three consecutive summary sentences. These artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative language clusters heavily in descriptive passages ("fury still smoking in the corners like spent cordite," "shadows that seemed to swallow the present and exhale the past") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the audience-reaction sequence: "The trucker saw... The dealer saw... The woman... saw" repeats structure across three beats. Minor register drift into abstract diction ("moral certainty," "raw choices," "narrative gave her permission") in peak moments. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("bruised with dawn," "signature in negative space") charges the ending but borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is ambitious and imagistic ("clouds pooled at its entrance like shy visitors," "spores that had not yet learned their vectors were gone") with strong density in many lines. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence mar momentum: "transiently rooted" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "temporary structures as signals" recurs as a nearly verbatim phrase across multiple paragraphs; "blushing stillness" is repeated without reweighting. Stock metaphor "the sky itself was embarrassed" and the phrase "she was transiently rooted, but the memory she shaped was permanent in its impermanence" edges into paradox-for-paradox's sake. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she understood," "she recognized") dull immediacy in reflective beats. Baseline scaffold penalty −0.6; template cadence in repeated phrases adds −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The sanctum was no longer her prison, but her instrument" immediately followed by "her heart, once as frozen…now beat"; "snowmelt ardor" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence: "She touched…she greeted…she would remain" in the final third flattens rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("she recognized," "she understood," "she wept") dull immediacy in peak beats. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-story redundancy and synonym churn ("thawed," "warmed," "melting") reduce density. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the Q7 cap on 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, but figurative density approaches overwriting in several high-pressure beats: "each one a precise green thread in a pattern," "gift that felt like," "labyrinth of maybes built from certainties," "oracle," "library," "question mark," "sentence in a language"—metaphor stacks without always adding pressure. Two paraphrase loops: the Archive is described twice in adjacent paragraphs as both records/map and repository/patterns. Filter verbs ("she'd seen," "she saw") appear but remain tolerable. The final third maintains clarity and the closure image is clean, limiting total penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. However, minor loops and scaffold weaken density: "The irony crystallized" is immediately followed by explanation; "This was empirically ironic" restates rather than advances; "He believed that if he could decode" is paraphrased by "His frugality served him here." Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "Night after night" and "grid upon grid" constructions. Some figurative language ("bridge across the abyss," "prayer in lines and angles") charges the conceptual frame, but other moments ("ghost-scent of burnt myrrh," "dusky harmony") feel ornamental. Proofreading is clean, and technical detail (magic square, cuneiform, constellation Pabilsag) reads plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "mosaic of every grudge," "black knot in the air," "vertebrae" of wounds, "shockwave" of memory—metaphors pile up in adjacent lines, violating the overwriting coherence test (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "The sanctuary responded… its architecture flowing like water—grace shifting, never static, never quite the same mercy twice" restates the same flux three ways without added pressure (−0.2). The final paragraph shifts into thesis-statement prose ("her scheme was simply this: to teach that…"), breaking scene momentum with scaffold-like summarization (−0.4). Sentence openings vary, but information density is low—many lines restate the concept without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with glass/frost/starlight imagery recurring purposefully to charge the closure. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "shattered glass mountain," "frost-silvered trunks that reached like cracked crystal," "metal cold as a glacier's memory," and "ghost-scent of apples and stardust" pack metaphor into nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without variation in texture. Paraphrase loop: "Kael understood that to capture his runaway dream, he must recreate the sextant" followed by "There, he began the delicate work of grinding new mirrors" restates intent without advancing action. Template cadence: "The dream hovered… / Kael knew he could not seize it… / He placed the sextant's broken frame… / Through synchronized breathing, he began…" runs four consecutive moves with similar stems. Minor scaffold: "firmly grounded in the traditions of his craft" and "firmly grounded among them" repeat the prompt's "firmly grounded" without transforming it. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density and loops; artifacts do not touch the closure image directly but pervade the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the opening lines establish vivid imagery with controlled density. Figurative language is purposeful in early beats (apple boughs, quartz eyes, ribbon as bridge). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the ribbon's meaning is restated across paragraphs 5, 6, 16, 18, and 29 without added pressure; the orchard's revival is summarized three times in the final third. Template cadence surfaces in the middle section with repeated "she [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. The squirrel encounter, while engaging, does not advance causality and reads as charming padding. The final paragraph's summary mode ("In the years that followed") flattens momentum and re-explains the theme already dramatized. Clarity and propulsion are strong in the work-scene beats, but the closure third loses density to redundancy and exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, the middle section shows template cadence: "He needed to inquire... Instead, he retreated... There, among the humming pipes... The nonlinear inheritance meant..." reads as sequential exposition blocks. Paraphrase loops appear: "bewildered curator" / "bewilderment was not a flaw"; "forbidden knowledge" is named three times in proximity without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: memories arrive "like scattered pages" then must be "restrung" as beads. The closure sequence is clean and propulsive, but artifacts in the middle third prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.9)
    Figurative density is high ("symphony," "chord," "note," "composition," "movement") across nearly every paragraph, creating template cadence without taught pattern or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "silent stories" / "silent song" / "silent chorus" / "silent chord"; "unheard symphony" appears nine times. Scaffold phrasing recurs: "She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Together they [verb]." The "visual symphony" mosaic and "acoustic" stone read as strained metaphor blurring literal sense. Filter verbs stack in peaks: "felt," "noticed," "realized," "thought." Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with purposeful paragraph breaks and sentence-level momentum in the descent sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the ship itself was a blissfully aberrant monument" is echoed by "cheerful calliope pipes jutted from rusted iron"; "unkindled solace" is restated three times without added meaning. Template cadence is mild ("She had come… She could feel… She traced…"). Figurative language is occasionally mixed (the ship "exhales" while also being a "vessel of trapped freedom"). Line-level clarity is adequate but density could be higher; some sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully—short declarative beats ("The seal showed a phoenix") alternating with longer accumulative sentences—and information density is high, with most lines advancing discovery or thematic resonance. However, several patterns recur: "warmly methodical" appears three times identically, "fables of absence" twice, and figurative strings cluster in the final third ("sonic ghost," "surgical precision," "subsonic resonance," "semantic bomb") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties (−0.5 in Q7). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The phantom diplomat existed only in a loose thread" / "a timeline aborted before it could accumulate witnesses" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.2). The prose is legible and propulsive through most beats, and the final image—"some fables must release their silence to keep the present honest"—closes with thematic charge, but the artifact load in the closure zone (final paragraph) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate—many lines do double duty (e.g., "The stone's gentle luminescence brightened, casting intricate shadows on the frozen walls" advances both stone state and visual texture). However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles flatten momentum: "The echo chamber stone began to vibrate, its glow intensifying" is followed two paragraphs later by "The echo chamber stone resonated, its glow now a pulsing heartbeat," then "the stone's gentle luminescence brightened"—three adjacent beats repeat the same content (stone glows/pulses) without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "Lira [verb]" across the middle third. Stock metaphors: "bloom of silence," "hammered repose," "gentle luminescence" recur as labels without fresh connotation. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image's charge, triggering pattern-artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "beacon of light," "starlight through cracked glass," "thistle-blown hope," "shattered sun," "universe's oldest language." Multiple adjacent lines restate the theme ("coincidence was merely pattern," "signatures written across time," "coincidence was the echo of a deeper order") creating paraphrase loops. Template cadence in the final third: "The beacon would guide them, and they would guide her, and meaning would be remade..." Elevated diction ("retrocognitively blessed," "discordant shards," "beacon's apex") clashes with the POV. Clarity remains high, but momentum sags under lyric ornamentation. Apply −0.8 for figurative overload and paraphrase loops, escalated because they touch the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is vivid ("fog became solid," "stormlight, neither sun nor moon but weather's own pulse"). Information density is generally high, with sensory detail integrated into action. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "Whispers intensified" / "whispers resolved"; "preemptively nostalgic grief" / "preemptively nostalgic heart ached"; "deepening hush" recurs four times without functional shift, reading as template cadence. The final third leans on summary ("she sat motionless, listening to silence between whispers, silence between heartbeats") rather than concrete propulsion. Stock metaphors ("silence that held more truth than any whisper") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt them as her own," "she heard it through the archway") dull immediacy in peak beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for filter stacks in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines: "The chant wove through the hush, a thread of sound…" and "Now, as the hush deepened, she listened with ambient awareness…"; "She walked on… She walked into the dark"; "The night still held no stars… was no longer empty" recycles the starless motif without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across seven sentences in the final third. Figurative density is high throughout ("bloom of violet flame," "helix, a dancer of light," "tower of light," "beacon") without pattern-teaching or payoff, cluttering peak beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("gravity of hopelessness," "buoyancy of wonder") reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Rounding these issues: baseline artifact penalty −0.8, plus template-cadence penalty −0.4, total effective reduction ~−1.2 from a mid-6 start.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent, though density is high across most beats without pattern-teaching (e.g., "stars whispered," "liquid silver," "soft current," "tiny clock"). Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 5 and 6 restate the tangential observation method. Template cadence appears in repeated "she [verb]" stems. No major artifacts touch closure, but the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear frequently: "She tasted the silence of the morning, the silence of the night, the silence of the inverted hour" exemplifies list-structure repetition without added pressure. Mixed metaphors ("flavor of stillness," "symphony of hush") and abstract modifiers ("gilded hush," "stretched knot") recur in high-stakes beats, reducing clarity. The final paragraph stacks declarative summaries rather than propelling toward a concrete closure image. Baseline deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, abstract diction in peak beats −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, with sentence length modulating between the opening's long, layered construction and the clipped exchanges mid-scene. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Three friction points lower the score: (1) "fluidly logical" appears twice in identical phrasing, a paraphrase loop; (2) "vaulting hush" recurs three times without reweighting, approaching stock phrase territory; (3) the final paragraph's "the quiet she had learned to harvest" and "ready to teach silence its next lesson" restate the same idea within two sentences. Figurative language (storm glass as mood indicator, prismatic light as emotional lens) is dense but mostly coherent; one strained moment: "silence became something you could almost touch" is cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy overwriting throughout: "peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" appears three times verbatim, "wisely adventurous" recurs as filler, and the final third stacks paraphrase loops ("Her work complete, she ascended… Behind her, the throne waited… The city would wake…"). Template cadence dominates the coda with parallel "The [noun] [verb]" constructions across six consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphors ("throne's crown-slot," "chronoshawl dissolved into dawn mist") and register drift ("sally forth," "midwifing") obscure clarity in peak beats. Density is low; many lines restate without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "She burned bridges carefully" (line 5) / "She burned bridges carefully, but she also built them" (line 45); "loaded emptiness" appears three times without reweighting; "threshold" and "fading" recur in template cadence. Template sentence stems dominate the second half: "She taught him to breathe again," "She taught him to sculpt his breath," "She taught them all to breathe." Mixed metaphor: "threshold itself was fading, its edges blurring like a breath in winter"—thresholds have edges, breath does not blur edges. Stock phrases ("quiet desperation," "fragile hope," "rare crack in her stoic facade") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Cumulative artifact penalty of −1.2 applied; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language (sapphire glow, stardust, threads of seam) is vivid. Paraphrase loops appear: "The quantum promise, Kael realized, was not a contract but a probabilistic bond" restates prior exposition without new pressure. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Stock phrases—"heartbeat the world seemed to split," "quiet resolve," "mischief and virtue"—dilute specificity. Clarity remains high and no causality breaks occur, but density dips in the reflective back half (−0.6 for paraphrase + template patterns per Q7 artifact pack). Information density is uneven: early beats advance multiple jobs, later ones elaborate theme without new action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense phrase recycling pervades the text: "golden shadows" (7×), "first yawn of evening" (4×), "eloquently silent" (3×), "bridge of intuition" (3×), "standing waves" (4×), "sepia reading room" (3×), creating paraphrase loops and synonym churn that obscure causality at closure ("the golden shadows of memory"). Mixed metaphor: "turning pages into a symphony of light" conflates tactile and auditory vehicles. Template cadence runs ("He lifted… He approached… He turned… He listened… He stared… He smiled…") across multiple paragraphs. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 in Q7 for spread across beats including closure; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "the abandoned marionette theater program" (repeated verbatim four times), "shivering bliss" (three times), "murmured allegiance" (three times), "shape of possibility" (five times). Synonym churn: "withdrew" → "withdrawn" → "loneliness" without fresh texture. The final third contains heavy scaffold: "And so," "And the marionettes," "And though," "And the greenhouse"—five consecutive paragraph openers. Per artifact penalty pack, baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph), triggering cap at 8.8 globally and disallowing 9+ in all categories.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high: most sentences advance characterization, world detail, or thematic pressure. "Broken-hearted, but it was a specialized grief" and the dust-reading method establish voice and stakes efficiently. The button's discovery beat layers physical description, inference method, and emotional weight without padding. Minor loop: "tactfully hopeful" appears three times with similar framing, and "small kindnesses" recurs in near-identical constructions (final paragraph echoes mid-story phrasing). Rhythm varies appropriately, though the closing paragraph stacks summary statements where a sharper final image might land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies adequately, but template cadence appears in middle beats: "She waited…crouched…sketched…" stems repeat without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense in non-peak moments ("revised histories flickered across screens like dying stars," "concrete slab shuddered, split, and a steel door rose from the shallows like a promise"), creating mild overwriting without payoff. Paraphrase loop: "Her plan had unravelled completely" immediately follows a paragraph demonstrating that fact. Information density is moderate; several sentences serve primarily as transit scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The prophecy, now hushed, left only a quietly vivid trace" appears twice verbatim. Synonym churn cycles "vested hush," "silence," "quiet," "hush" across adjacent lines without added meaning. Template cadence: "He [verb], [gerund]" runs through the second half unbroken. Stock metaphors ("pressing against," "bleeding into") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "recalled") dull immediacy. The closure beat is contaminated by scaffold: "The grotto stood empty, a radiant shell in the mist, its secret now buried in the vested hush" restates prior lines without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "build tiny monuments" (three times), "emerges transformed always" (twice identically), "mossy delight" (four times), and synonym churn for the same concept (forgotten voices/tales/folklore, tiny monuments/cairns, transform/unfold/split). Template cadence—"She [verb]s... She [verb]s"—runs across eight consecutive beats without variation. The phrase "the hush where past meets prophecy" appears verbatim three times. Mixed metaphor: leaves "fall like whispers" then form a "mosaic that shimmers with mossy delight," conflating sound, texture, and light incoherently.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence-level clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The opening ("broken-clock tinkerer who could mend any timepiece except the one measuring her own life") and several beats lean on stock metaphoric phrasing ("memory rotted into mulch," "certainty is just another kind of ash"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "She had come to befriend... / She understood that... / She climbed back... / In her workshop, she would keep..." No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in the reflective close slows momentum without pattern-payoff. Minor proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is ambitious—"the concrete had remembered its liquid self for three heartbeats"—but density sometimes tips into overwriting: "luminous regret," "factually mystical," and the zodiac-naming sequence pile metaphor without clear propulsion. The foundry's final exhale is vivid, yet paraphrase loops appear ("she'd never learned the weight of her own name until it was used to sign a failure" restates the warrant-signing regret). Template stems recur ("She'd learned," "She understood," "Elara began"). Apply −0.6 for loops and register drift in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and high information density. Strong opening ("Kael had been collecting lost souls so long that they'd misplaced their own") and closing images. However, figurative language is dense throughout without significant modulation: "throat of stone," "arterial gold," "broken mirrors and stitched-together apologies" appear in most paragraphs, creating ornamental weight in some mid-story beats. Minor template cadence in the middle third: several sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions. Clarity remains high and no loops or scaffolding obscure causality, but the unvaried metaphoric density slightly dulls propulsion in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "brace" appears six times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "UV light" and "ultraviolet" cycle interchangeably; "mercy" is redefined in nearly identical terms three times. Template cadence runs dominate ("She [verb], [object]" structure repeats across a dozen sentences). Stock metaphors ("wave of heat," "violet fire," "shroud") appear without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("she understood: mercy was not to be calculated"), triggering a −1.7 baseline penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "eternal instant" recurs five times without functional variation; "elusively tangible" is restated as "shift from cool stone to warm glass"; "honoring overlooked histories" is rephrased across three paragraphs. Template cadence pervades the final third: "I realized / I felt / I closed / I placed / I thought / I slipped / I became" stacks identical sentence stems without rhythm variation. The figurative language ("flicker of memory surged," "weight of an eternal instant," "heartbeat of memory") clusters densely in high-pressure beats, reducing clarity. Pronoun reference remains clean and no major grammar errors, but momentum drags under synonym churn and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or theme. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the fluorescent death, longer accumulation during ghost arrival). Minor template cadence in the ghost catalog: "A ringmaster's top hat materialized first... Then came the others—tightrope walker, bearded lady, a child acrobat" reads list-like. "Weightless burden" recurs three times in the final third, borderline loop. Stock metaphor: "like damaged film reels" and "like crumpled paper" are functional but familiar. No paraphrase loops or causality-obscuring artifacts; the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in the opening third, establishing setting and stakes efficiently. However, figurative language saturates several high-pressure beats without enough grounding: "smoke made of memory," "rustling awakening," "silent explosion that was neither destruction nor creation" layer metaphor on metaphor, reducing concrete clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: "compress eternity into a moment" / "hold infinity in a single breath" restate the same concept. No major artifacts touch closure directly, but density of abstraction at key beats applies −0.4 for figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "He covered the mirror...the same cloth that had shrouded...He pressed the shard...the crystal resonated" restates actions without added pressure. Synonym churn ("specter/echo," "burnished sorrow/quiet grace," "reimagine/decode") inflates word count. Template cadence ("He stood...He waited...He pressed...He lowered") across the storm sequence. Stock metaphors: "gilded cage," "sea of lies," "beacon for a new age." Mixed vehicle: "translucent veils" layering over time is coherent, but "burnished sorrow" mixing metal-finishing with emotion is strained. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("He lowered the shard...his poet's heart still burning"), triggering high-end penalty in this category and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry strong imagery ("each tick a falling grain of sand," "spider silk and moonlight drawn from memory"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: rust spreading/blooming/retreating is described in adjacent paragraphs with synonym churn; the covenant "whispered temptations" then "screamed in defeat" in near-succession. Template cadence runs: "He wound… He spoke… He placed…" stack without variance. Stock metaphors ("malignant flower," "serpent of corrosion") appear in high-pressure beats. Clarity is maintained, but density suffers from repetitive phrasing. Deduct −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line clarity is high; sentence rhythm varies, and paragraph structure supports accumulation. Information density is strong: most lines advance image, memory, or stance. Two mild loops: "some truths could only be approached through sensory detours" (paragraph 8) is paraphrased by "some awakenings must remain hinged" (penultimate graf). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one muddle: "understanding swung open on a different kind of hinge, one made of scent and silence rather than logic" mixes the mechanical (hinge) with the ephemeral (scent/silence) without a clear vehicle. Template stems appear once: "She saw them... She understood... She stood... She placed..." across four beats, creating mild cadence monotony. No filter-verb stacks or major scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, discovery, or internal stance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Mild overwriting in the opening: "turbine-hum reverie" and "breathing backdrop" stack figurative language without immediate payoff, and "perpetually learning the language of salt and grain" borders on elevated diction for a working sculptor under pressure. The closure image is clear and propulsive. Grammar and sequencing are clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor ("ribs of an ancient beast," "silver whisper," "umbral tenderness"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The postcards...seemed to hum" / "She would often arrange them" restates their presence without new pressure. Template cadence: "She thought...She imagined...She learned" runs across multiple paragraphs. Register drift into poetic abstraction ("quiet reckoning," "silver promise") clashes with concrete action. Artifacts touch closure ("her heart bloomed like the night flowers"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Information density is high, but the prose relies on template phrasing and paraphrase loops: "She had to parley… negotiate the terms" / "The cipher key wasn't mathematical but geographical" / "They knew the tide would erase… but the photograph might preserve." Sentences often restate the same idea in adjacent lines without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("bleeding into memories," "saltwater taste of survival") and elevated register ("calcified into myth," "archival peace") appear frequently without modulation. The final third accelerates but retains formulaic cadence ("The arrangement was complete: messages decoded, parley concluded, truth released"). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her solemn duty fulfilled, and finally slept"), triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "He refused to accept the false comfort" / "He would not settle for false comfort"; "not to resurrect" / "not a resurrected past" / "not with a resurrection"; "ghost town" recurs six times without reweighting. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He could not crack it, but he could conceive..." / "He imagined..." / "He sketched..." / "He placed..." / "He whispered..." / "He knew..." / "He walked..."). Stock metaphors appear: "tide-worn shells," "seed of a new civilization," "scaffolding of futures." These artifacts cluster in the closure sequence, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose is dense with sensory detail. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of the accidental prophecy" is restated as "velvet disquiet" without added pressure, and "quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet" echoes the earlier "velvet shroud" metaphor. Template cadence in the vault sequence ("placed… sealed… inscribed") slightly flattens momentum. Information density is high, but a few scaffold phrases ("he knew he must," "he realized") could be cut for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "furious tranquility" / "furiously tranquil" / "wild serenity" cycle without functional variation; "borrowed time" is repeated ten times, often in adjacent lines with minimal reweighting ("texture of borrowed time" appears four times, twice in the final paragraph). Template cadence dominates the middle third: "She knew…," "She felt…," "She placed…" sentences stack without rhythmic variety. Stock metaphors ("breath exhaled," "silk sliding over steel") and filter-verb runs ("felt the tug," "felt the borrowed time settle," "felt the furious tranquility") dull immediacy in peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering high-band disqualification and cap at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds carries figurative language ("prayer frozen mid-breath," "winds that had forgotten how to whisper," "knife-edge moment," "instruments' quiet song"), creating a steady hum of lyricism that flattens rather than modulates pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The solstice hush pressed heavier than usual, a silence that swallowed echoes" is revisited multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in the final third with parallel "she thought" and "The glue would..." constructions. Informational density is low in several paragraphs that restate the same choice (switch vs. bell vs. wait) without advancing causality. Clarity remains high, so the harm is momentum drag rather than opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "hush...silence," "emptiness...fertile ground for unseen growth," "flourishing stillness" repeated without fresh detail. Template cadence runs: "She realized," "She understood," "She decided," "She vowed" stack across the final third (−0.6). Stock metaphor strings ("silken shroud," "heart...armored," "tapestry of hope") dull specificity. Figurative density in most sentences lacks grounding action, flattening momentum. Clarity holds, but information density is low—many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" recycled in identical syntactic slots; "mute eloquence" and "weight of unspoken words" restated without added pressure; adjacent paragraphs (lines 11–13, 22–24) restate the same content (covenant → bees → afterlife) in synonym churn. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The ghost's [noun]" create algorithmic rhythm. Stock metaphors ("shimmered like a mirage," "pressed against the glass") cluster in the final third. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger combined penalties: −1.7 baseline in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for final-third concentration.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.0)
    Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern or payoff: "borrowed-time timekeeper," "pulse spread out like ink in water," "voice like pages turning," "roads she could travel at will" cluster in adjacent lines, creating metaphor fatigue rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed time wasn't a debt to be repaid, but a gift to be spent" closely echoes the urn fragment as "endings are just beginnings that have forgotten their numbers." Template cadence is visible in the garage-sale listings (parallel "vintage lamp…," "set of four teacups…" structures). Clarity remains mostly intact, but information density is low in the middle third where the garage-sale method is described rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: paragraphs 2/17 restate "beauty in the incomplete"; paragraphs 6/20 repeat "harmonizing discord into burnished hush"; paragraphs 10/31 recycle "fragments/broken things as poetry." Template cadence ("He [verb]" x18) creates drumbeat monotony. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of light and shadow," "threads," "stitching") accumulate without fresh vehicle. "Burnished hush" appears six times as a phrase-object rather than an earned image. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "burnished hush" and "woven dawns"), triggering −1.7 baseline plus pattern spread.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual flow, but template cadence appears frequently: "He worked gently systematic," "The copper wire became a calendar," "Stone warmed beneath his palms, a gentle systematic pulse." The phrase "gently systematic" recurs four times, "brazen calm" three times, creating a labeled texture rather than varied embodiment. Some paraphrase loops: "patience, gratitude, continue" appears twice verbatim, and multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions. Information density is generally high, but peak beats (the final wrapping, the moment of translation) compress into summary rather than slowing for sensory detail. No major grammar or clarity issues; the prose is clean and purposeful but leans on stock metaphors (pillars "pulsed," wire "sang") and repeats its own diction under pressure. The closure image—warm pillars, singing wires—lands clearly but without fresh figuration.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and decorative restatements accumulate throughout: "chemistry of homecoming" appears six times, often without added pressure; "bronze quiet" recurs as atmosphere rather than constraint; "dusty footprints" is repeated in nearly identical phrasing four times. Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("She knelt... She stood... She descended... She walked"). Mixed metaphors weaken clarity: "heart a quiet forge of bronze resolve" conflates forging (loud, hot) with quiet bronze. The figurative density in reflective passages slows momentum without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (seed pods as "tiny ships," dust as "promise of renewal") is mostly controlled. However, the final third exhibits paraphrase loops: "battlefield is no longer a scar; it is a living tapestry" restates the transformation across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the summary section ("The locals whispered… he knew… Now, each twilight, he returns…"). Information density is high early but thins in the closing summary. No major clarity breaks, but the ending loses propulsion through redundant restatement of the garden's symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: most lines advance place, memory, or object significance. Rhythm varies appropriately (short beats during trek, longer reflection in vault). No paraphrase loops detected. The "wild hush" motif recurs purposefully without becoming mechanical. Minor deductions: "The stench of metal and memory" and "a world that had screamed itself raw" verge on stock post-apocalyptic phrasing. "His mind worked intuitively descriptive" is a slightly awkward construction that momentarily stalls momentum. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (rusted spine, screamed raw, wild hush) clusters without pattern-teaching, though the images remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: paragraphs 6–7 restate temporal stretching without advancing pressure, and paragraphs 22–23 recycle "silence" and "echo" in near-identical frames. Template cadence appears in the mid-section (repeated "I [verb]" stems across paragraphs 11–14). Mixed metaphor in the final line: one cannot be "in a gilded compass rose" (the appliqué is worn, not inhabited), breaking physical logic. Applying −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template runs, and −0.3 for the closure-adjacent metaphor slip totals −1.3 in Q7, with an additional small penalty for the artifact touching the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: multiple paragraphs open with "Kaelen" or "The" and restate the same thematic claims ("wonder," "unknown," "sacredly playful") across adjacent lines without new pressure or detail. Stock metaphors abound ("cathedral of glass," "beacon of wonder"). The final six paragraphs cycle through near-identical summary statements about Kaelen's transformation and the spire's new role, flattening momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the spire's call," "felt the unknown reaching") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without coherent pattern or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "small gestures" appears in five paragraphs, "luminous absence" in four, and synonym churn cycles through "quiet," "whispered," "soft percussion." Template cadence appears in the closing beats ("For the sake of," "Thus the story ends," "And somewhere in"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching payoff—metaphors accumulate ("nomadic penumbra," "chessboard of power," "archive of memory") but do not constrain action. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and employs varied sentence openings, but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats. Stacked metaphors—"mercury-glass seer," "shape of home," "hidden thunder," "seed of the ancient words"—accumulate without clarifying causality. Paraphrase loops appear: "the shape of home" recurs across six paragraphs with minimal reweighting until the end. Template cadence in the final third: "She walked... She smiled... In the stillness..." The closure beat is burdened by summary ("The story of...would be whispered") rather than image. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she realized," "she lifted") dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines do descriptive work without advancing goal or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally high, but scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "He realized that each loose thread...," followed by "By decoding the frayed threads..." restates method without added pressure. "Fierce repose" recurs four times, mostly as label. Stock metaphors—"stubborn shadow," "heavy shroud," "river after a broken dam"—stack without fresh angle. The final paragraph over-explains theme ("forgiveness was not a single act..."). Template cadence in places: "He [verb], [noun phrase]" appears in adjacent beats. Deductions total approximately −1.2 for loops, stock phrasing, and thematic summary in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("ribcage of a forgotten god," "prism of questioning voices"). Three friction points lower the score: paraphrase loops in the final section recycle the refraction metaphor without new pressure; the phrase "forged hush" appears twice identically without evolving meaning; and stacked filter-verb constructions in the middle ("he believed," "they say," "Kael smiled") dull immediacy. The opening and spire-painting beats carry strong propulsion, but closure-adjacent lines lean on summary ("the community gathered not to sacrifice but to speak") rather than scene-specific action, capping the score under 6.5.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose carries strong figurative density ("workshop groaned as gears bit into rusted cogs, its hull a fragile copper bell") and purposeful rhythm in the opening third. However, runs of template stems appear throughout: "She held... and pressed," "She had... before," "She was still... but now," "She would find... breath by held breath." The phrase "breath by held breath" recurs in the opening, midpoint, and close as anchoring motif, but adjacent lines often paraphrase the same idea: "between breaths held underwater" becomes "breath by held breath" within two paragraphs, then "her last held breath" shortly after. Mixed metaphor appears in "filament of memory unraveled" followed immediately by "caught it with her mind's needle and stitched it"—unraveling and stitching work against each other. Elevated diction ("dire enchantment," "mosaic of intention") in peak beats (exchanger failing, inhaling poison) pulls away from embodied urgency. Information density is high in procedural beats but thins in thematic recapitulation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "hidden promise" appears four times, "temporary eternity" five times, "intimately aloof" twice, "hidden oasis" nine times—synonym churn without pressure accumulation. Template cadence in the final third: "He had...," "He placed...," "He whispered...," "He turned..." across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative language ("spiderweb of silver," "ghost of a quay," "threads in the tapestry") stacks without coherent metaphor vehicle, and the ending summary ("The cracked mirror, the painted seashell, the hidden oasis—all were threads...") lists rather than propels. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and the prose propels through accumulation: each sentence layering vibration, scent, memory, and light. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening at the climax ("He stood perfectly still, half-formed words dying in his throat"). However, several lines loop conceptually: "vibrations of her intent" and "vibrations entered him...shaking loose something he had forgotten" restate rather than advance. The phrase "the way his shoulders tightened...the way his knuckles whitened" and "the way scent carried intention" repeat the stem "the way" within adjacent beats, creating template cadence. Minor clarity issue: "purify intentions" is asserted but never dramatized—what does purification look like on the page?

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is frequent ("black tide," "silent scream," "mosaic of cold light"). Clarity is generally high, but overwriting clusters in several beats: "tears carved rivers down his dust-streaked face as the raw solace of hearing her again flooded through him" stacks metaphor and abstraction without specificity. "The night swallowed the signal station whole, a black tide lapping" and "starlit perch" repeat elevated register without variation. Template openings ("The station's walls," "The voice never," "The midnight call") create minor cadence monotony. Density is good—most lines advance atmosphere or action—but peak emotional beats lean on stock phrases ("raw solace," "fragile peace") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "occlude" appears six times across the piece in near-identical grammatical slots, and "psychological safety" / "fragile safety" / "shared safety" cycle without added nuance. The phrase "discredited textbooks" is repeated verbatim three times, twice in the same sentence structure. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "The moment I touched… / I knew I had to… / The settlement… / I buried…" chains identical stems across four consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphors muddle peak beats: truth is both "splinter," "shard," and "contagion," and the eye's "whisper" contradicts its visual "gaze." Figurative density is high but often decorative rather than propulsive, slowing momentum in the storm-turn paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and sensory, with strong images (opal dock, trembling shadows, great lens spinning). However, paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "softly persistent" recurs six times with diminishing effect; "borrowed memory" is repeated in similar constructions across the final third; and multiple sentences open with "The" or "Cornelius" in template cadence (lines 18–22). The final six paragraphs loop through closure gestures—each one restating that the memory is now part of the lighthouse—without propulsion, and stock phrases like "quiet testament," "silent promise," and "deepest fog of isolation" blur specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template runs and −0.3 for elevated stock phrases touching the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several passages stack metaphor and figurative language densely without clear payoff: "promise...hung in the air like pipe smoke," "warm second heartbeat," "cathedral of bioluminescent fungi," "ancient promise." The phrase "blooming cavern's ancient promise" in the final line borders on abstract elevation that clashes with prior concreteness. The figurative density in the cavern description (turquoise, violet, nectar, moss flowers) is vivid but does not advance pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "The matrix chip flared... The stone reacted... A voice spoke." No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats triggers a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high and often mixed: "starlight bled across the stones like silver wounds" works, but "frost etching lacy menace" anthropomorphizes without clear vehicle logic, and "mist like the spine of a sleeping god" adds a third metaphor system. Paraphrase loops appear: "the mystery was finally unraveled" restates "to unravel the mystery" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the reflection-heavy final third ("She learned to read," "She understood now," "And so the queen settled"). Filter-verb stacks in vision sequence ("She saw a young woman... The vision showed") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the dream had become the ridge, and the ember grotto burned on").

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "to capture the density of presence" appears in multiple forms across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "return differently" is restated five times. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]...") across runs of three or more sentences. Stock metaphors ("ink into water," "wind through leaves") and therapy-speak abstractions ("resolve," "intention," "presence") cluster in peak beats. The final third repeats the opening's language mechanically, triggering artifact penalties that disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high and often effective ("birch bark scroll waited...edges curled like ancient fingers," "gravity's rules just another story I'd stopped believing"), but several metaphors in quick succession risk overwriting in high-pressure beats (the flight sequence stacks metaphor without breathing room). Paraphrase loops appear: "chronological confusion wasn't a symptom anymore; it was the terrain" closely echoes earlier time-as-shattered-mirror imagery without advancing pressure. Template cadence in places: "I wrote...," "I understood...," "I descended..." Clarity remains mostly intact, but density accumulation slows momentum in the middle third. No major artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is moderate; some lines repeat conceptually (past selves as witnesses/shards).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats ("watercolors in rain," "invisible ink," "valve turning," "liquid heartbeat," "trembling calm") without pattern-teaching, creating texture that occasionally obscures propulsion. Template phrasing recurs: "She had been trying to…" "She realized…" "She couldn't… but she could…" in adjacent paragraphs, producing synonym loops around acceptance. Paraphrase loop evident in paragraphs describing her shift ("stopped trusting," "betraying me," then "trying to control," "force… back into alignment") without added pressure. Information density is high in clock mechanics but sags in repeated declarations of what Elena understands.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("clouds swirled like forgotten thoughts," "second skin of quiet," "each second a thread of possibility"), creating lyric texture but risking overwriting in peak beats where momentum matters most. Several paraphrase loops appear: "saturated hush" recurs four times with minimal tonal shift, and "held breath" / "holding her breath" cycles across multiple lines. Template cadence runs ("She whispered... She tucked... She thought") and filter-verb clusters in high-pressure moments dull immediacy. Proofreading is clean and information density is generally high, but the repetitive phrasing and metaphor stacking in closure beats trigger line-level penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clear with vivid images (silver case, curling mist, brittle rainbow), but recurrent phrasing creates template cadence: "the apology she had rehearsed," "the apology settle between them," "the apology finally delivered" loops the same anchor across three beats without added pressure. Metaphor density is high throughout—fractured light, vibrating chords, fermatas, trapped songs—and while individually legible, the cumulative effect in dialogue and description edges toward overwriting, especially in peak beats where simplicity would sharpen impact. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She explained," "Mira watched," "Mira felt") dull immediacy in key moments, and the final two paragraphs rehearse the closure concept ("imperfect miracles," "resonant," "harmonize") multiple times, flattening the ending's punch with paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    Figurative density is high and often striking ("entropy's yawn," "lie that felt like truth," "scream wrapped in resounding hush"), yet many metaphors layer without clear progression or causal linkage, dulling momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the library dissolved into the void's forgetting" echoes "swallowed the last star"; "resounding hush" recurs four times without functional reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb], [object]" and "The [noun] [verb], its [noun] [adj]" structures repeat across paragraphs. Sentence openings show variety, but information density sags mid-passage where cosmic imagery accumulates without advancing plot or choice. Combined artifacts justify −1.0 total in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "razor edges" appears in seven lines with minimal functional variation; "counting backwards" recurs in summary rather than distinct beats; "fjord quiet" and "horizon measurement station" loop without new information. Template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across adjacent sentences; apply −0.6. Figurative density ("razor edges," "pool of glass," "fabric of the present") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff; apply −0.4 for overwriting. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized," "wondered," "imagined") dull immediacy in peak beats; add −0.3. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph repeats key/edges/silence); apply disallow-9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, template cadence appears across multiple beats: "She [verb], [gerund] that…" recurs in adjacent sentences. Paraphrase loops: "the library held a hidden room" / "a forgotten alcove" / "a small chamber" restate location without added pressure. Figurative language clusters densely ("arteries held a secret map," "breathe with dust," "pulse of a gambler's heart") without pattern-teaching, muddling clarity in peak beats. Scaffold phrases ("a relic from," "a language of") appear repeatedly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in early beats (booth, disc, calls introduced economically). However, paraphrase loops appear: "each call added a new layer… yet also a fragile thread" restates connection without advancing pressure; "she had learned that every ending is only the start" echoes "teach endings how to begin" within three lines. Template cadence in the final third: "Mira smiled… Mira walked… Mira knew… She would always be… Her heart… And each new day…" stacks parallel stems without pattern-teaching payoff. Figurative language density spikes in closure beats ("echo lingered," "door at dawn," "spirit lingered") without muddle but borders on overwriting. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and image-rich but shows template cadence and synonym loops: "gently thorough" appears twice, "proximate cause" recurs mechanically, "weight of small moments" is paraphrased across multiple lines. Figurative density is high throughout ("like a dark ribbon," "like ghostly echoes," "like a lantern") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting check. Sentence rhythm varies, but stems repeat ("She withdrew," "She realized," "She opened"). Information density is moderate; some lines (tea steeping mirroring hillside steep) feel ornamental. No causality breaks, but the accumulation of decorative metaphor and conceptual redundancy ("proximate cause" as a repeated motif without mechanical clarity) lowers momentum. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, −0.4 for figurative density without coherent payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "rumors instead of tickets" / "tales of distant disasters, each whispered rumor"; "loneliness that haunted" / "weary of isolation" / "shared loneliness turning into shared hope." Template cadence: "She spoke…She began…She chose…She stood." Stock metaphors: "beacon," "glimmer of recognition," "collective glow." "Desperately jocular" appears three times but never manifests in concrete speech or gesture. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 total for loops, template stems, and label repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence runs appear across the story: "She + past-tense verb" openers repeat in seven consecutive sentences mid-story ("She knelt," "She absorbed," "She understood," "She rose," "She stepped," "She smiled," "She would map"), triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops cluster around "quiet blaze" and "language" (six mentions of "language" across eleven lines, often restating the same content without added pressure), adding −0.4. Stock metaphors ("constellations paused," "hinge of night") and synonym churn ("uncharted emotional depths," "heart's uncharted territories") further dull momentum, adding −0.3. Figurative density in the closure passage (final eight lines) stacks elevated diction without clear propulsion, reducing immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (sensory detail + character interiority) but scaffold phrasing ("she understood then," "now she carried") pads transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high ("gravitational anomaly where light bent into whispered spirals," "residue of forgotten timelines") and often vivid, but the final third stacks paraphrase loops: paragraphs beginning "He understood now," "He wondered if," "The pen had taught him," and "And so he continued" restate the protagonist's contentment without new pressure. Template cadence appears in repeated "strange comfort" mentions (four times in six paragraphs) and "planted… seeds" (three variations). Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but momentum flattens under synonym churn and reflective scaffolding that does not tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (the camera "a small rehearsal for his own disappearance"). Two frictions lower the score: some figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching ("the moon hung so low it seemed to press"; "moon write poetry on water") and a paraphrase loop around "silence" that restates rather than advances (paragraphs describing silence as absence, then void, then emptiness overlap conceptually). The final image is clean and propulsive. No major grammar or tense slips; spatial choreography tracks. Paragraph structure varies purposefully. A few decorative constructions ("vintage camera with no film, its leather case cracked like dried mud") slow momentum slightly in the opening third, but the closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level clarity is mostly strong, with good sensory anchors (sulfur, charcoal, ochre pigment) and varied syntax. Two clusters harm momentum: the opening three paragraphs recycle "Kael + past-tense verb" stems without variation, and the middle section stacks filter verbs ("breath caught," "felt thick," "began reconstructing") that dull immediacy. The phrase "deep层 archive" is a generation artifact (Chinese character embedded without translation). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; "volcanic tenderness" metaphor recurs without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("memories grew as visible vibrations," "regrets blossomed into dying chords," "shards arrived without context") and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching; "auroral sorrow—beautiful, transient, and aching with loss" doubles the metaphor load mid-beat. Several paraphrase loops: "entangled his neural pathways" / "their memories would entangle"; "quietly rebellious" appears twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence in the final third: "on the quartz trees…on the copper vines…on the frozen waterfall" / "on the stone, on the water's surface, on his temples." Information density is generally high, but momentum sags slightly in the exposition block explaining the treatment. Applying −0.6 for density and loop artifacts under the Q7 pack.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle section (key as tuning fork, coin vibration, harmonic nodes). However, the opening and closing contain scaffold phrases ("He'd been waiting for this moment," "From then on, the longshoremen said") and thematic paraphrase loops in the final four paragraphs that restate the whisper-versus-shout thesis multiple times. The phrase "calculated spontaneity" appears twice without reweighting. Minor template cadence in exposition passages ("His method seemed mad...Now Marek understood").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: lines 32–56 recycle "stars," "dock," "water," "guardian," "mirror," "darkness" in synonym chains and template cadence without new information. Line 38 ("a silent sentinel, teaching darkness to cherish the stars") restates line 27's lesson; lines 43–50 echo earlier shutter and mirror beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") and abstract constructions ("spiralingly calm presence," "stillwater tension") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Stock metaphors ("bruised sky," "invisible thread") and the formulaic final summary ("And so the dock remained…") flatten propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering high-band disqualification and a −1.4 aggregate deduction in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from synonym churn and thematic echo: "unspoken worries/fears/curiosity" cycles without fresh detail, "hush where past meets prophecy" repeats verbatim, and "forests of second thoughts" appears three times as label rather than image. Metaphors mix registers (magnetic grotto, amplified quiet, cobalt shadows) without coherent sensory logic. Template cadence dominates: "He [verb]...He [verb]..." structures recur across six paragraphs. The final beat stacks abstractions ("the most powerful revolutions are often the quietest") in place of concrete closure image, flattening momentum at the story's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and some lines carry density ("The guardian reached out, not with a sword, but with a touch that was both threat and care"). However, the piece suffers from template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation, and synonym loops appear ("the island began its retreat, sinking back into the deep" echoes "vanishing shore" and "disappearing island"). Stock metaphors cluster: "fortress of duty," "warm against her chest," "horizon without chains." Figurative language in peak beats (guardian dissolves into mist, island pulse) is legible but leans generic. Paraphrase loop: "her true nature was not in hauling crates but in the fluid motion of dance" restates the setup without added pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") stack in reflective passages. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("strength and softness are not enemies" reads didactic), triggering the −1.7 band and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "remade hush" / "not quite silence"; "emotional void" / "hollow echo"; "blank canvas" / "bare canvas"; "grief pooled" / "weight of loss" / "heavy air of grief." Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("The blank faced performer stood… Their blades turned… After the happiness mandate…"). The figurative density is high but often mixed or decorative ("turbines as scissors cutting the sky," "shavings fall like silent confessions") without clear vehicle logic. Sentence openings vary little ("The performer…" recurs across many paragraphs). These artifacts pervade the piece and touch the closure beats, dulling propulsion. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and closure-beat presence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate: "dissolving boundaries" appears six times, "tremor of certainty" three times, "paraphrase" five times, all restating the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She [verb]" openers) across 8+ sentences. Mixed metaphors: a "spine of frozen music" that "hums" conflates skeletal rigidity with sound, and "cloud-shadow of words" lacks coherent vehicle. Figurative density in most sentences (lantern-moth hush, cobalt atrium, quartz glow, twilight sky) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply −1.2 for loops and template stems, −0.5 for register drift and figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: lines 6–7 repeat Elara's cunning reputation and barter goal; lines 25–27 restate the "awakening" idea across three sentences. Template cadence runs of "She [verb]" and "Dorian [verb]" appear in the final third. Stock metaphors ("frozen breath of memory," "veil of steam") and filter-verb stacks ("watched," "seeing," "feeling") dull immediacy in peak beats. Patterned-artifact penalty (−1.2) and late-third template presence disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative language is dense throughout—"golden shadows pooled beneath it like molasses," "sound became a landscape she could climb"—but coherence holds. Template cadence appears in several runs: "Each panel preserved... laughter from... whale songs from... the creak of wooden doors" and "The sound didn't just fill the room; it became..." Minor paraphrase loops occur: "artificial pilgrimage" is explained twice (paragraphs 3 and 6). The final third stacks thematic declarations—"texture of connection," "the proof that being heard meant being changed," "the beautiful imperfection"—that reduce propulsion. Information density is high early, then dips into conceptual restatement at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "lab-grown sorrow," "subdued ardor," "curtains of intention danced with the quiet joy of purpose." Metaphors stack in most sentences, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "genuinely artificial" recurs as label; "withering" and "bloom" are synonym-churned across beats. Template cadence: "She understood," "She'd been teaching," "Elara understood," "She left." Register drifts into abstraction ("protein-engineered paper," "shifted its pulse") without anchoring in Elara's tactile experience. Information density is low; many lines rephrase prior metaphors rather than advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Metaphor density is high throughout ("each drop a tiny crystal of a broken economy," "steel tape unspooling like a tongue telling truths") without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure; in high-pressure beats this ornamental layering slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "reverse engineering culture" is restated three times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in adjacent sentences: "The cards showed... But in the negative space... Mara studied..." Register drifts into academic abstraction ("fractal of branching possibilities," "vectors of regrowth") that clashes with the present-tense ritual. Information density is uneven—some lines do double work (tape as timeline tool), others ("sirens wailed" distant color) add texture without advancing situation. The opening line is vivid but the closing beat repeats prior claims rather than sharpening the image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "atoms of nostalgia" is restated across six paragraphs without added detail; "anguished joy" appears four times with identical structure. Template cadence: "She touched... She felt... She saw... She must..." runs through the middle third. Synonym churn: "fragile epoch," "end of innocence," and "bittersweet burden" cycle without propulsion. Stock metaphors: "double-edged sword," "silent chorus of whispers," "leaf on a stream." The final paragraph stacks these artifacts at closure, triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative density (dying sun, rose and violet, kaleidoscope, ghostly echoes) appears in most sentences of the pagoda beat without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. Information density is high in the climactic paragraphs (stone placement, shadow metamorphosis). However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "softly deliberate" is stated twice in adjacent beats; "shape of hope" recurs five times with minimal variation; "luminous regret" and "luminous aura/veil" appear in close succession without reweighting. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "The shadow..." or "She..." in runs of three or more. Stock metaphors ("river of memory," "fragile hope") lack fresh specificity. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure paragraph ("luminous regret" × 2). Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.9 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and template stems; an additional −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high (each paragraph advances her stance or the animal care), and rhythm varies to support pressure. Clean grammar and spatial choreography. Two minor issues: "The workshop smelled of cedar shavings and the quiet vividness of night-blooming jasmine" has a slightly mixed register ("quiet vividness" feels abstract); and "the shimmering stillness" recurs as a motif but borders on stock lyricism rather than concrete image. No loops or paraphrase, but figurative density in the opening paragraph slightly exceeds function. Deduction within non-closure band: −0.5 for elevated-diction drift in two spots.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose carries multiple paraphrase loops: "closure was not an ending but a reading" restates the thesis across three sentences in the final paragraph; "the tunnel had not just led her...but had opened a passage within herself" offers synonym variation without new information. Template cadence appears in stacked participial constructions: "She leaned closer, letting...seeking"; "She pulled aside...revealing"; "Elara knelt...felt...seemed to shimmer." Mixed metaphor: sand "hidden behind a veil of ice" then later "flowing like liquid silver" without causal transition. Figurative density in most sentences ("voices a chorus of forgotten stories," "streaks of fire," "liquid silver," "verses in a poem") dilutes rather than sharpens peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"coiled like sleeping snake," "compacted, became dense as neutron star matter," "lullaby for love"—but metaphors occasionally clash (love as both neutron star and storage node) and the register never modulates with urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "unused love" and "stored love" cycle across adjacent lines without added meaning. Template cadence: "She saw unused love stored... It nested in angles... It compacted..." (three parallel constructions in succession) flattens rhythm. Information density is uneven; the incubation vigil repeats conceptual ground. Artifacts touch closure ("map settled into skin" is told, not shown), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "unspoken words" / "silent language," "trapped creativity" / "block," "stardust" / "remembered stardust" / "memory of stardust" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in runs like "She heard… She sought… She decided… She set… She felt… She lay… She dreamed… She lifted… She thought…" across the piece. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. Mixed metaphors: "silent language that curled like smoke" and "creativity… trapped like a star behind a veil of ice" then "flowed like a river." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, balancing short declaratives ("Tonight, something was wrong") with longer lyric constructions. Information density is high in imagery but lower in causal linkage; several sentences restate the guard's ontology without advancing pressure ("They were occasionally everywhere at once," "their passage left no tracks, just ripples in the quantum foam"). Minor paraphrase loop: "the sparks in the unlit corners" and "corner so unlit it had never learned to burn" recycle the same motif without added pressure. The chess clock detail (2:00:01) appears mid-story without clear causal grounding. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences begin with "The guard" or "The" + noun, creating a drumbeat effect. One non-English verb ("干涉ed") is a clear artifact that breaks legibility at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.7)
    Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching payoff: "consciousness slid along neural pathways," "air itself seemed to calculate," "wild frontier shimmered like heat-haze." Multiple mixed metaphors: the forest is simultaneously neural, computational, and botanical without coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence: "She [verb], [object]" repeats across 8+ lines. Paraphrase loops are pervasive—paragraphs 6 and 7 restate the same insight about mechanism/wildness. Overwriting penalty: −1.0 cumulative for density + coherence + loops.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "The air smelled of salt and pine, and the wind hummed…" / "The boat slipped across the water, the oars making soft plashes…" / "Lin's heart swelled, and they ran…" Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third—"quiet courage," "gentle persistence," "shoreline lullaby" recur without added pressure. Stock phrases ("held its breath," "world seemed to exhale") and synonym churn ("gentle, persistent" appears six times) dull momentum. The closure beat is touched by scaffold: "the journey, though indirect, was theirs to traverse."

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies, information density is high, and no loops or scaffold mar the closure beat. Minor text-pattern issue: "She understood that now, understood how the ordinary became celestial" repeats the stem "understood" in adjacent clauses without added pressure (paraphrase-loop check: −0.2). "The cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying. That vigilance was not a moment but a life. That hope could survive even when frozen at the root" stacks three parallel declarations in quick succession, edging toward template cadence but remaining voice-motivated. Propulsion is strong; every sentence advances. No artifacts touch the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("each tome a tomb," "each stroke a note in a melody of revelation," "invisible crown," "hollow echo"), creating density without propulsion and obscuring the causal spine. Paraphrase loops appear ("His shoulders…bore the invisible crown" / "He had lived across the pause…each night a breath") and template cadence runs through the Vael sequence. Register remains elevated even at the closure beat ("divine hammer," "motes of light"), and figurative coherence wobbles ("pulled at his glamour" / "threads…unraveling" / "shattered like glass"). The final third inherits all these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Minor paraphrase loop: "periodically eternal pattern" / "periodically eternal ghost" / "periodically eternal climb" restates the same conceptual frame without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in archive sequence: "She carried… There she began… Each piece…" runs three stems without variation (−0.4). Filter verbs ("felt eternal," "felt," "letting the rhythm carry her") cluster in reflective beats but do not obscure immediacy given the lens. No metaphor muddle. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than plot or character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high and rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating through the singing sequence. Minor artifacts appear: "The lull in rebellion" repeats across two sentences in the opening with slight paraphrase; "awkward confidence" is named twice without dramatized contradiction; "meaning" recurs frequently as abstract anchor. The final third avoids loops and the closure image is clean. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "violent peace and silent storm" toggles to paradox without clear vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is competent but marred by template cadence and thematic redundancy. Opening paragraphs establish rhythm and setting cleanly. Paraphrase loops appear: "reconstruction" echoes across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "intentional change" and "conscious choice" restate the same concept in adjacent sections. Stock metaphors ("roots already rewriting the story," "future they whispered") inflate texture without advancing sense. Final paragraphs summarize collective response ("Word spread," "the people had begun to understand") rather than dramatizing, flattening momentum. Sentence stems vary adequately until the ending, where declarative summary ("They would grow...a tradition evolved") replaces scene pressure with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, image, or thematic pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at crisis—"Then he froze"—longer cumulative syntax in reflection). However, the closing paragraph deploys a template cadence: three metaphoric equations in parallel ("his body the tower, his somatic markers the beam, his pearl of stillness the lens") that, while thematically coherent, verge on mechanical stacking. The phrase "pearl of stillness" recurs five times, functioning as motif but occasionally as filler when the concept is re-explained rather than deepened. Minor paraphrase loop: "optimism anchored in realism" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. No mixed metaphors; figurative language (lighthouse, nacre, roots) remains coherent. Proofreading is clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("luminescent ache," "needle through frayed cloth," "dust motes became stars"). Information density is high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Reality fragmented further… walls breathed in and out… shifting between solid and smoke" repeats the fragmentation concept across adjacent lines without new pressure. The rhetorical-question stem recurs five times, creating template cadence. "Luminescent" and "ache" are used twice each, diluting specificity. Elevated diction ("redesign fate," "pivot point") in peak beats slightly distances the reader from embodied action. No major clarity breaks, but the overwriting and loops prevent high-band entry. Closure image is vivid and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "consciously wild" / "controlled ferocity" / "serene anger" / "calm anger" / "quiet fury" / "conscious wildness" all label the same unembodied state across the text. Template cadence appears in runs: "The wind outside… while the sun's return…" and "He placed… He would watch… And when it did…" with identical stems. The final third stacks these artifacts ("his conscious wildness a blade, his serene anger a forge") without concrete action. Stock metaphors ("time slowed," "breath caught," "veil") and filter verbs ("seemed to") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. These artifacts appear in the closure section, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is generally strong, but several loops and template patterns accumulate. "Dizzying quiet" appears three times; "contraband truths" recurs five times across the story, often in similar constructions. The phrase "bravely conflicted" bookends without adding new pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "The dangerous liaison letter..." opens two paragraphs, and "Through dormant networks..." appears twice. Mixed metaphors appear: "the quiet into a delivery system for scandal" and "empire of ice melting beneath the heat" strain coherence. These patterns cluster in the second half, dulling propulsion as the climax unfolds.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Each morning she walked... singing hymns" restates "inculcating plants with values" without added pressure; "quiet fire" repeats as descriptor for both perfume and the disc's presence. Template stems recur ("She [verb]" opens multiple beats). Stock metaphors populate peak moments ("quiet fire," "threads in the tapestry"). The final paragraph stacks summary lines that restate rather than advance ("Together, they anchored her world, a world where..."). These artifacts dull closure momentum and trigger accumulated line-debt penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("pearls from a broken string," "smoke made of midnight and milk"), but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Transliterate" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same function. Parallel structures ("voiced through silence," "voiced a deeper silence") and recycled sentence stems ("The lullaby was not sung but voiced," "Echo's ghost shimmered") flatten momentum. Propulsion stalls in the middle third as synonym churn (transliterate, voice, zigzag) replaces causal tightening. No critical causality breaks, but the artifacts dull the closure beat's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters heavily: "gravity well of silence," "event horizon of red ink," "hollow sphere that collapses," "cosmic joke," "small dark star...go supernova" all within the central reflection block, creating metaphor saturation without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation. The astronomical vehicle is consistent but applied mechanically across beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "orbits of regret" appears three times with slight variation but no pressure escalation. Clarity remains intact and no artifacts touch the closure transmission beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "meteor hush," "silence fell like cosmic dust," "dark membrane," "star by star, a celestial fabric tearing softly." Sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "constellation tattooist" recurs without functional variation; "the letters explained" / "the letters had been written" / "the antique furniture had been waiting" stack exposition in adjacent beats. Template cadence in the middle third ("She could translate," "She placed," "She wrote") flattens propulsion. The closure sequence recovers momentum ("One by one, the ghostly projections faded"), yet earlier scaffold and synonym churn ("screeching," "screamed," "sob") accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whispering gallery tile flake" is glossed three ways in adjacent lines; "emergent hush" recurs without added pressure; "socially perceptive" appears twice in template cadence. Figurative density is high without clarity—"lilac unease," "violet mist," "chalk fossils of ancient stories"—creating atmospheric blur rather than propulsion (−0.5). Sentence stems repeat: "The grotto [verb]," "She [verb]," "The tile flake [verb]." Key closure beat ("she'd given the silence a vocabulary") tells rather than showing the change through concrete image. Stock metaphors ("ghost fingers," "question mark") and filter-verb stacks ("felt its secret shiver," "recognized the method") dull immediacy (cumulative −0.9).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: the thematic phrases ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "warm coldness," "aberrant mercy," "retrocognitively trapped") recur across paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence appears in runs of similar declarative constructions ("The plaza... The city... The mosaic..."). Figurative density is high but often generic or mixed ("heart forged in frost and flame," "sky like cracked glass," "tears were frozen, caught between warmth and cold"). Sentence openings vary minimally; many paragraphs begin with "The" or "And the." Information density is low—many lines restate mood or theme rather than advancing knowledge or choice. The final third consists largely of thematic summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure breathes appropriately. Several strong images ("petals that chimed like glass bells," "moments like shards of a broken mirror") anchor the lyric texture. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "fractured timeline" is restated in three adjacent paragraphs without added detail; "echoes" recurs in template cadence ("produce echoes," "producing echoes," "echoes of a thousand past ovations," "nostalgic echo," "final echo"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the middle third ("He saw her teetering," "He wanted to lure," "She felt a sudden warmth"). Some sentences do double duty, but others rehash: the timeline-shard conceit is told twice in successive paragraphs. Momentum slows in the expository center before the coin toss.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractally precise" appears six times, "hidden pathways" five, "willowglass hope" four, "somatic marker" three—often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. Sentences frequently restate the same content with synonym churn (e.g., "The hum matched the fractally precise lattice" followed by "each vibration echoing the pill's nanotech design"). Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" x5 in the final third, "The [noun]" x4. The loops and scaffold dull momentum and flatten the closure image. Figurative density is high but coherent (fractal lattice, glowing threads, fractal tree).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The fossil was both fact and mysticism; its mineralized form held data, yet it whispered of lost seasons" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses. Template cadence runs through the middle section ("She aimed… She extended… She followed… She pressed… She lifted… She watched… She began…"), and stock metaphors ("wrap around her like a shroud," "pale line") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines describe without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high but purposeful for the lyric mode—"epochs past," "prison of light," "geode of chance"—with most metaphors coherent and rooted in the amber/sand/glass motif. Minor template-cadence runs appear: "She'd found buttons in river mud, behind dresser drawers, in the pockets of ghosts" uses parallel structure without variation, and "She worked...she began...She quietly inspired...She'd found" clusters "she" openings in adjacent paragraphs. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks touch the closure beat, and information density is high throughout. Applying −0.4 for template stems (not touching closure) under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clear and advances the scene, but several runs exhibit template cadence: "taught him patience, had taught him that courage wasn't spent…" (synonym loop), "the means to fix what he'd shattered when he'd chosen…" (nested clauses that restate), "the knowledge that could resurrect what he'd destroyed" (paraphrase of prior line). Figurative density is high in the opening third ("mist clung…like a shroud," "messages…like sleeping things," "snow…like a secret beneath ice") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, risking overwriting. The final image ("empty hands but a full heart") is clean and propulsive. Information density is uneven: the exposition about Elena and the broken network could be compressed. No major clarity breaks, but momentum occasionally stalls for retrospective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm is controlled and varies (short beats during waiting, longer during the crossing). Information density is high in the opening and setting paragraphs. Figurative language is dense ("fog's geometry," "palimpsest promise," "universe of patience collapsing") and mostly coherent, but concentration in nearly every sentence risks overwriting—"distillation," "percolate," "ambient awareness," "spindrift serenity" stack within a small window without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation. Two paraphrase loops: "The promise had been simple once" and "But life layered complications upon it" restate backstory across adjacent paragraphs; "She had married and widowed, while he had remained" echoes the prior history. Template cadence in the middle third ("Each drop was…," "The yarn needle traced…," "The promise had been…") flattens momentum. Clarity at closure holds, so artifact penalties remain moderate. No major grammar or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies and sentences carry distinct texture ("chimney smoke flattened," "sharp gentleness"). Information density is high; most lines advance image or understanding. However, several passages loop conceptually: "some things submit to entropy, while others absorb it and transform it" restates the premise without added pressure, and the final paragraph recycles "sharp gentleness" and "thrum" without new detail. Figurative language clusters heavily ("phototropic," "glazes on a single vessel," "love's architecture") but remains coherent. Minor scaffold in the long penultimate paragraph ("For now, she walked on...") dilutes momentum. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are strong overall; loops and restated abstractions prevent entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished with purposeful rhythm and vivid image ("the water caught the moon and threw it back in shards of silver"), yet multiple beats fall into template cadence and synonym loops: "She could still smell…," "She gathered…," "She planted…," "She would return…," "She walked…," "She slipped…" creates a monotonous stem pattern across the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear ("translating it, turning grief into geometry, memory into moonlight" restates the same concept three times) and stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection ("cathedral of fragrance," "canvas waiting for moonlight's brush"). The final paragraph stacks declarations—"Tomorrow, the city would wake… And Maya would be… The gardener had become…"—that tell closure rather than charge it through image and action. Information density is high in early beats but sags mid-piece with reflective summary that doesn't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and thematic redundancy pervade the text: "brittle awakening" recurs without reweighting; "isolation into independence" is restated across multiple beats; "contemporary of extinct species" appears in setup and close without transformation. Template cadence dominates (She + action, each paragraph opening similarly). Figurative language ("atomic dance," "temporal tides," "neural pathways merging") clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims. Final third loops key concepts ("hum," "reflection," "bridge") without advancing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lyric and image-rich but shows patterned overwriting: nearly every sentence carries figurative language without variance in register or rhythm to match escalation. Paraphrase loops appear ("the thread she sought," "thread that connects all things," "luminous thread"). Template cadence visible in parallel constructions ("She imagined...she knew," "watched...place," "realized...belonged"). Stock metaphors ("locked chest," "watercolor dream") and elevated diction ("inevitably whimsical rhythm") persist without grounding in concrete action. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Clarity is strong, but several beats exhibit template cadence ("she was cautiously hopeful… she remained… she was still cautiously hopeful") and paraphrase loops (the tricksters' nature is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure). The phrase "ethereal grit" appears twice, feeling more like a prompt echo than organic voice. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") cluster in expository beats, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's repetition of the opening trait ("cautiously hopeful") reads as thematic bookend rather than momentum, and the line "a human heart, beating back the dark with nothing but static, stubborn faith" stacks modifiers without fresh specificity. Baseline −0.6 for paraphrase and template cadence; −0.2 for filter-verb stack in mid-story exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting and template patterns: "prismatic desire," "phantom threshold," "sonic tempest," "wistful rebellion," "prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny" stack figurative or abstract labels without concrete anchoring. Paraphrase loops abound: "compass point" is named 11 times, often in adjacent sentences with synonym churn ("copper-tipped drafting compass point," "blueprint drafting compass point"). Runs of "The [noun]" sentence openers create rhythmic monotony. Mixed metaphors: walls "breathing with malevolent will" (anthropomorphic) then "spatial mutiny" (abstract military metaphor) in one beat. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "her wistful rebellion had not only unearthed a lost key but had also struck a chord of change." Baseline −1.0 for loops and register drift; −0.7 additional for figurative density obscuring action in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.7)
    The opening lines establish vivid texture and rhythm varies across beats. However, paraphrase loops appear in the studio sequence: "She didn't see faces; she saw geometries" is restated as "her precision wasn't habit—it was armor" and again as "her face blindness had always been a subtraction; now it became an addition." Template cadence in the portrait beat ("She drew…then lanced…By unifying") and metaphor density ("river flowing from a childhood scar," "constellation the victim had named") cluster without payoff. The closure beat is clean but prior artifacts lower momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance situation or imagery. Rhythm varies, and the read-aloud test passes without algorithmic monotony. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence issues appear: "The librarian's hands shook" / "The librarian's fingers trembled"; "nervously confident" recurs three times without fresh embodiment; "spongey dread" is named six times, sometimes with synonym churn ("wet wool," "clinging fog"). Stock metaphor strings in peak beats ("crystalline purpose," "dry and certain had finally caught flame") elevate diction beyond the librarian's internal texture under stress. The closure beat itself is clean, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loops, stock metaphor strings) trigger −1.5 within Q7, setting the grade at 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and templated phrasing. Lines 6–7 repeat the "pixelated" concept without added pressure; lines 22–23 restate motivation nearly verbatim from line 7. Synonym churn is evident: "luminous disbelief" recurs four times, "pixelated amnesty" three times, with minimal variation in meaning. Template cadence dominates middle paragraphs: "He [verb], [object]" structures stack without rhythmic variation ("He held it up," "He was dynamically observant," "He noticed the pattern," "He decided to recount"). Stock metaphors ("ashes of 'never,'" "fertile ground for possibility") cluster in the final third, dulling the closure image. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings in closure beats −0.6) yields a cumulative −1.5 deduction within Q7, escalated because artifacts touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "polished calm" appears nine times, often restating the same interior state across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]" openings and "the son [verb]" stems recur without variation. The middle passage summarizing the startup's rise, market shift, and fall compresses necessary backstory but uses stock startup clichés ("tech empire," "market shifted like a trapeze artist"). Figurative language clusters in non-peak beats without taught pattern. Artifact density in the final third (−1.0 in Q7) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dense figurative language ("photonic amber," "epochs," "constellation of resilience") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are evident: "burden alone" / "shared burden" / "burdens must be carried" and "healing with words" / "soothe…wound" / "bind…memory" recycle concepts across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs appear ("She had discovered," "She understood now," "She left"). Register drifts into academic abstractions ("phonemes," "attribute," "methodology") that clash with the interior lens. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("words drifted up…healing what could never be healed alone"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category further.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm varies across beats; sentence openings alternate. Clarity is generally high, though several lines carry paraphrase loops: "The druid stood, his guarded heart lighter, though the warlike serenity remained" echoes "Now he stood in the aftermath...curse pressing heavier." Stock metaphors appear ("truth like a lantern," "like a blade before the strike"). Template cadence in the final third: multiple "The druid [verb]" stems in sequence. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (ice fractures + confession stirs) but others merely restate mood without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose carries high figurative density and rhythmic ambition, but several beats suffer from overwriting and mixed metaphor: "dusk settled" pairs oddly with "bruised purple," and "the future arrived early" abstracts a temporal claim that never materializes as concrete constraint. The sentence "She was a root-bound visionary, her feet tangled in the thorny legacy of her ancestors while her mind reached for constellations yet unmapped" stacks three metaphors without clear physical grounding, and "dreamstuff leaking through the seams of reality like sap" mixes registers (folksy "dreamstuff," clinical "seams," organic "sap"). Filter verbs cluster in mid-passage ("She recognized," "she saw," "she understood"), dulling immediacy during the vision sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "the eclipsed covenant wasn't forgotten, merely hidden" and "Elara knew better" restate the same stance across adjacent lines. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("she understood now," "she was ready"), lowering the score and disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.9)
    The phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" appears six times, creating a synonym loop that dulls momentum. Stock metaphors ("bones of the earth," "hollow places in her soul," "patched but threadbare") and therapy-speak ("holes in the soul," "fiercely gentle") cluster in peak beats without fresh embodiment. The opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, but paraphrase loops (e.g., "lighter and heavier all at once" / "a different shape now") and repetitive sentence stems ("The root pulsed," "The Keeper watched," "Elara rose") reduce information density. Cumulative artifacts trigger −1.0 in Q7 under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack; the phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" in the final third disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but the piece carries paraphrase loops and template cadence in the final third: "She would not let… Instead, she would create… each appraisal a quiet performance, each fact a note…" recycles the same syntactic stem without pressure gain. The opening anchors cleanly and sensory detail is specific, yet stock metaphors ("ghostly echo," "canvas for her unspoken questions") appear in high-stakes beats without transformation. Figurative language clusters near closure without clear payoff, weakening propulsion when the ending should land hardest. No severe opacity, but the scaffold reduces punch.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout—"touching distance," "wedge-shaped signs," "braid of presence and absence"—and mostly coherent, though the cumulative effect occasionally stalls momentum in non-peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "her haunted ambition" recurs nearly verbatim across four paragraphs without added pressure until the final pivot. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "She placed... She saw... She must reestablish... Descending... Each wedge..." The closure beat itself is clean, with "touching distance" recharging prior material, but the loop and stem repetition in earlier paragraphs trigger a −0.6 deduction. Information density is solid; most lines advance understanding or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines serve character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies between short declaratives and longer accretive sentences that mirror accumulation. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "contradiction in her protocols she couldn't parse" / "feeling contradiction as physical pressure"; "neither data nor flesh" / "neither fully human nor entirely machine"; the "wintersun serenity" phrase repeats three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs in the final section ("Let them be fish... Let them breathe... Let them remind") accumulate to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("heart—such as it was," "walked on") and filter-verb stacks ("watched," "feeling," "seeing") in early beats dull immediacy. No critical opacity, but cumulative artifacts prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting: "bunk frames sagged like ribs of a starving beast," "latent radiance pulsing in rhythm with her own heartbeat," "spectral promises." The final two paragraphs loop conceptually, restating the theme across multiple sentences without added pressure. Template stems appear: "I wanted... I dreamed... I hoped... I wished... I planned... I meant... I promised..." (acceptable as found-text confessions). Apply density and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 total.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is maintained and imagery is vivid, but the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "raw solace" appears four times, "accordion bellows patched with tape" three times in near-identical phrasing, and multiple sentences restate the same forgiveness/flow concept. Template cadence runs ("She felt," "She knew," "She took") cluster in the middle third. Mixed metaphors appear ("map references...pulse," "red circles...like wounds...heartbeats"). These artifacts dull momentum and trigger baseline deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cautious exuberance" appears twice with identical phrasing; "unspoken words" and "library of unspoken words" cycle without variation. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "She [verb], [article] [noun]" repeats across a dozen lines. "Each tick was a delay, a propagation of a secret through propagation delays" is circular and conceptually redundant. The final third includes stock metaphors ("cold as forgotten memory") and several filter-verb stacks that flatten the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is often lush and image-rich, but density of figurative language in nearly every sentence creates texture overload: "velvet shadows," "ghost-lines," "dewdrop on a spider's web," "torn veil," "mulberry ache," "golden cage" accumulate without propulsive pressure. Several beats loop conceptually: the promise "losing its glow" is restated three times without added specificity. Key action beats (finding the seed, confronting the envoy, planting the seed) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing momentum. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("The stain showed... Her telepathy... Lira smiled... She picked up...") flattens rhythm. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high (each line advances ritual or stakes), and clarity holds through most beats. However, figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure moments ("thin silver thread," "droplet of light—pure, unrepeatable," "green mouth drinking starlight," "borrowed brilliance") without clear pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop: "lucidly watchful" appears three times, once as mere echo (−0.2). No scaffold or template cadence. Propulsion is strong; no significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and figurative language (vines as "dark serpents," cloud-sea, grapes as "universe of forgotten names") is vivid if occasionally stacked. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm generally serves momentum. Minor paraphrase loop between "rebirth was not a gift the grapes gave, but a choice the living made" and the later reprise of choice/tending distinctions. No major artifacts, but the epilogue's compressed summary (fifteen thousand sunsets, seventeen harvests, cloud-wanderer's letters) reads like scaffolding that tells rather than shows key closure material.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent, but paraphrase loops appear: "emptiness…void…emptiness" restates across adjacent lines; "hollow mirror shard" is repeated verbatim six times without evolving function. Template cadence runs appear ("I lifted…I grasped…I reached") across three or more sentences. Stock metaphors ("pale eye blinking," "inner fire burned bright") reduce specificity at key beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for stock strings in closure paragraph: total −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language ("soft fog," "silver threads," "second skin") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, creating density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops recur: "the lesson was complete" echoes "the tapestry unfolded, showing that to appear, one must first vanish." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" across paragraphs. Sentence-level propulsion stalls in the middle third where description circles the same images (rings, starlight, grotto pulse) without new information. The closure image—water closing "like a second skin"—lands clearly despite prior overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("limestone became bone and bone became history," "dust remembered"). In high-pressure beats (the bird spiral, the final comprehension), this density flattens momentum rather than sharpening it. Template-cadence runs appear in the opening third ("It had been her mentor's before her, and his mentor's before him" / "stone to sky, past to future"). Minor paraphrase loops: "centuries of layered dust" recurs five times without evolving meaning. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work but do not advance goal or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies well ("The spire was a needle…"; "Instead, the stone simply waited"). Information density is high in the opening paragraph. Loop detected: "accommodates impossibilities" recurs three times in similar phrasing without evolving pressure, and "lingering luminance" / "dimmed but not extinguished" / "pulsing" form a near-synonym cycle in the keystone description. Template cadence in the Refactory sentinels paragraph: "their perfect efficiency finding…" and "its own slow orbit…" read as parallel constructs without on-page dramatization. These patterns dull momentum slightly in the final third. Figurative density ("breathing evaporating memory," "cathedral of dying light") is heavy but coherent and voice-motivated, so no overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is dense with figurative language that often obscures rather than propels: "words that glittered like embers," "a shade between violet and void," "a soft, invisible aurora" pile metaphors without clear vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "The lanterns' light danced on the water, casting ripples that sang in hues of amber and rose" restates the lantern imagery without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" stems ("He brushed," "He wandered," "He believed," "He opened," "He rose"), and stock metaphors ("silver coin tossed into a sea of ink") reduce immediacy. Filter-verb stacks ("He realized," "He knew," "He smiled, knowing") cluster in the final third, dulling the closure beat and triggering the global 9+ disallow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Heavy overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or elevated image ("ambered observatory," "fossilized reality," "cosmic afterbirth noise," "causality's corpse"), creating a drumbeat rhythm that flattens rather than accelerates pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "understanding static bursts" recurs three times with synonym churn (distill meaning, find the signal, feeling the shape of silence). Template cadence in the middle third ("She had spent…," "She needed…," "She grabbed…," "She walked…," "She understood…," "She would…") triggers −0.6. The closure beat is touched by summary-heavy phrasing ("her own wavelength stretch outward") rather than concrete action, escalating the line-debt penalty to −0.8. Filter-verb stacks ("began to distill," "needed to understand," "realized she must distill") add −0.5. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and the high-pressure beat guideline: baseline −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for touching closure, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled: "twilight bled," "voices filled the stone room with forgotten phrases that dissolved," "grief until the fears took shape." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or ritual. Template cadence appears in the crystallization sequence: "A kraken's tentacle became… A leviathan's maw became…" is formulaic repetition without pressure increase. Paraphrase loop: "The echo of sacrifice rang… The echo of sacrifice was her own…" restates the same content. Minor filter-verb stack: "she could show them," "she could give names," "she could carry." Propulsion remains strong through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere more than plot. Minor paraphrase loops: "brittle devotion" appears three times with slight variation, "earnestly naive" twice. Figurative language ("contained starlight," "bent the air") is vivid but occasionally strains clarity ("plausible impossibility made manifest" tells rather than shows). Scaffolding is minimal. The final line ("one drip at a time") feels engineered for thematic closure rather than emergent. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; some beats linger without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are strong; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphor and near-paraphrase: "mirrored hush" recurs three times with slight synonym variation ("silent sky," "mirrored hush outside had deepened"); "spin the fragments...into a story" and "weave the fragments into a narrative" are conceptual loops. The closure paragraph ("she carried the truth like a lantern, ready to spin it") echoes prior phrasing without added pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she imagined") are present but not excessive. Line-level density is moderate; several beats narrate observation without advancing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and free of major grammatical errors. Figurative language is dense throughout ("copper for lost empires," "glacier remembering it had once been cloud," "color between heartbeats") and mostly coherent, though some vehicles strain credibility (a crystal "singing" its "voice like a glacier remembering" mixes acoustic and thermal metaphors without grounding). Template cadence appears in the final third: "Here, sentiment and science... Here, a frozen crystal... Here, before the final transformation" constitutes a three-sentence parallel run (−0.4). Paraphrase loops are present: "to harmonize logic and intuition was not to merge them, but to let them dance" and "logic and intuition dissolve into simple understanding" restate the same insight across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("river of beads," "breathing grace") and elevated diction that drifts from tactile grounding in peak beats (−0.3). Total deductions approach −0.9; artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "soundless echo" appears five times without pattern payoff, "watcher's burden" recurs in adjacent paragraphs restating the same content, and "preserving trust under pressure" is repeated as a mantra without added detail. Template cadence runs dominate the middle third ("He [verb], [noun]. He [verb], [noun]..."). Stock metaphors (stars as eyes, fireflies as trust) and elevated diction ("fragile thread," "silent testament") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the Text Artifact penalty: baseline −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for register drift. No simultaneity errors or pronoun confusion, and sentence variety improves in the second half, but information density is low—many lines restate vigilance without advancing situation or emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high; most lines advance concept or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives at peak: "He fell to his knees"). Two distinct line-level issues: (1) paraphrase loop in mid-section ("Their words formed a perfect pretense... sliced through pretense") and template cadence in clone description ("One spoke of duty, another of legacy, the third of..."); (2) one mixed metaphor ("stones melting like ice in the sun of causality" conflates thermal and abstract vehicles). These artifacts cluster in non-closure beats, so penalty remains moderate. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Proofreading clean.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance both image and emotional charge. Figurative language clusters in places ("bruised fruit that still wanted to ripen," "macerate the hard silence that had calcified") but stays legible and mostly coherent. One mild template-cadence run in the climax paragraph: "She remembered... Now she conducted... The off-key wind poured..." A paraphrase loop appears late: "macerate the unsaid things" / "macerating silence" / "macerating the last of her grief"—three uses of the verb in close succession risk synonym churn. No major loops or scaffolding; rhythm varies and propulsion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "waiting in one place felt like a different kind of eternity" → "waiting became a form of seeing" → "waiting was no longer a sentence but a syntax" recycle the same conceptual ground without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("It had waited… it was still dimensionally homesick… it had never been exiled"). Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "mist thickened," "door began to form," "dew." Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("foggy lucidity," "braided together") that clashes with "feral" descriptor. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting and loop penalties totaling approximately −1.2, and the final-third artifact spread disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and many lines carry double duty (imagery advancing both atmosphere and theme). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "The embers would always be embers, never quite ash, never quite flame" restates the frozen-bloom concept already established; "She had no hope left, only the certainty of approximation, the beauty of the incomplete" cycles through similar terrain. Template cadence appears in the succession of short declarative statements in the final third ("That was enough." "The penny had dropped; the lock had turned."). Some figurative language ("tree of frozen glass," "pale fire-flowers") is evocative, but the density of metaphor without clear sensory grounding occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or action. However, multiple prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had assumed the shard was a signal... She had assumed silence was empty. She had assumed the tower's purpose..."), the stock metaphor "discarding assumptions like broken glass," and filter-verb reliance ("she could see," "she heard it"). The phrase "serenely electric" recurs without evolving meaning. The "tears were practical, a pressure release valve for the soul" intrudes with mechanical metaphor at a peak emotional beat. Template cadence and synonym churn slightly dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "resiliently positive" appears three times as label; "empty hourglass" is mentioned nine times, often with near-identical phrasing ("placed the empty hourglass back," "the empty hourglass sat"); "permanent transient" recurs without functional variation. Template cadence runs through the middle: "Lina [verb]" opener × 6 in close succession, "The [noun] [verb]" × 5. Purple clusters appear ("starlight pooling like silver in the hollows," "her voice a thread," "lighthouse in the ever-shifting dark") without dramatic necessity. Information density is moderate—many sentences do double work (hourglass warms + resonates, grotto responds + hums)—but the final third summarizes the cycle and Lina's stance rather than advancing pressure. No major grammar or continuity breaks, but momentum sags under synonym churn and repetitive stems.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is mostly clean and propulsive, with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the unsettling calm" is repeated three times across the story without variation, and the phrase "as memories alter" recurs identically. Template cadence is visible in the fragmented catalog ("A child's laugh... A soldier's final thought... A lover's name") which stalls momentum mid-climax. Mixed metaphors occur ("fever dream architect" and "rational enchantment" occupy incompatible registers), and "realistically imaginary" is repeated twice without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "unfolded horizons" recurs nine times; "edge geometry," "expand," and "balancedly curious" cycle without functional variation. The closing passage stacks synonym restatements—"the aliens hadn't just given them a city beneath waves. They had given a way to carry stars inside, to expand perception until every edge became a horizon waiting to unfold"—retreading the same concept across adjacent lines. Template cadence appears in the opening block ("Pelagia was… Seventy years… But tonight…"). These artifacts cluster in the final third, triggering −0.9 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("mist curling like a shroud," "lights painting the fog in brief, bright strokes") that advance atmosphere and action. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence in the opening third: "The air hung thick with a reeling hush" is immediately echoed by "voices thin as fog," and the repeated construction "I [verb]" appears in consecutive beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("curiosity flares like a struck match," "time slowing to a crawl") dull peak moments. The final third accelerates cleanly, but the density and propulsion are uneven across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural momentum. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (world-building + emotional charge). Minor loop: "invisible things" recurs three times across paragraphs without evolving meaning each instance, costing ~−0.3. Phase-transition metaphors are dense but coherent; no mixed vehicles. Propulsion is strong in the ascent sequence. One register note: "quarterly reports and profit margins" reads slightly editorial but remains within an embittered focalization. Zero typos or mechanical errors. High density and clear propulsion keep this in the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity is generally high; no major loops or contradictions. Sentence openings show variety. Two frictions: (1) paraphrase loop in paragraph 3–4 ("a survivor of a clerical death" / "her life into a ghost file" / "Her pulse beat a private metronome" repeats the misfiled-existence concept without added pressure), and (2) template cadence in the reflective block (lines 21–25: "She remembered... She had counted... The porcelain shard had belonged...") stacks past-perfect stems without variation. Figurative density ("like a frozen thought," "spread like nerves," "like ink drying") is high but coherent. No major momentum loss, yet the reflective block (lines 21–30, ~18% of text) flattens present pressure without a present-tense micro-choice to offset it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm and imagery are controlled; sentences vary in length and the lyric parallelism ("a voice like…," "a story that…") creates intended cadence. Information density is high in the first half. However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "the curse was broken, not by removal, but by fulfillment" followed by "meaning persisted" and "she had given texture a voice, and the echo had accepted the gift" restate closure without added pressure. Template cadence: "The spinebirds still flew… The curse had been a gift… The canyon of endless echoes…" across adjacent lines. Minor figurative muddle: "echoes kept its own counsel" mixes metaphor of counsel with echo. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems in the closure third.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence pervades: eight consecutive paragraphs begin with "She [verb]" or "[Noun] [verb]" without variation. Paraphrase loops cluster in the metamorphosis sequence: "becoming part of the cosmic jest" / "part of the harmony" / "now hers." Mixed metaphors stack without coherence: "harmony untamed" is both song and gravitational force without physical logic. The epilogue introduces new information (seekers arriving, Lyn teaching) that dilutes closure rather than sharpening it. Figurative density ("stubborn ember," "gravitational pull of history," "cosmic joke") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative density is high and often beautiful ("dying ember," "crystalline moment between heartbeat and thought"), but it appears in nearly every sentence, including peak beats, without pattern-teaching or payoff—this triggers the Overwriting Check (−0.5 in Q7). Paraphrase loops are present: "She played the locust's rhythm. / …She played it again" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Mixed metaphors appear: "uprooted from their own bodies" versus "planted in dangerous soil of hope" uses the same vehicle in contradictory ways (−0.4). The phrase "resonantly soft" recurs mechanically across six beats without variation. Template cadence runs ("She played… She felt… She realized…") flatten momentum (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("resonantly soft beat" in the final paragraph), which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (the arcade as commerce/nostalgia/border). Figurative language is dense but generally coherent ("neon veins pulsing like a heartbeat"). Paraphrase loop detected: "broken promise that haunted him was his own: a vow to deliver" immediately restates in next sentence "He had missed the drop, and the letter had burned." Template cadence in backstory sequence ("He had… the letter had… Now, each dusk, he…") reduces propulsion. Overwriting in "thunderstorm in a bottle, sealed by a promise that had shattered long ago" where the metaphor stacks without clarifying. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so cap non-closure penalty at −0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," "ghost-light," "breathing stillness" appear in most high-pressure beats without clear delineation. Paraphrase loops are present: the train "breathing" and "exhaling" recur across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is evident in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. "Quietly persistent" appears verbatim twice, a scaffold phrase. Mixed metaphors: "silence sang" and "possibility bloomed" blur vehicles. The density penalty (−0.5) and loop penalty (−0.4) apply; the final third contains these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is ornate and imagistic throughout: nearly every sentence carries figurative freight ("black hole of narrative," "narrative gravitation," "recursion folding into loops"). Density without pattern-teaching or escalation dulls momentum rather than sharpening it. Template cadence: "She had discovered," "She began her method," "She opened it," "She resumed her post" stacks identical subject-verb openings across key beats. Paraphrase loops: "the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion, each tale folding into the next" restates the premise rather than advancing it. Mixed register: "starlight and story," "photons dusted" elevate diction beyond the grounded present action. No line-level opacity prevents comprehension, but scaffold repetition and figurative over-layering create drag in high-pressure beats (portal, chamber, reawakening).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "capture runaway dream" / "capture … by letting them go," "luminous absence" / "absence shone brighter" / "luminous loss," "vitalize" recurs seven times without fresh meaning. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [metaphor]" across dozens of lines. Figurative density (nearly every sentence) lacks pattern-teaching or payoff and often muddles clarity: "dawn began slow performance of luminous absence" is more ornament than sense. Trigger: artifacts touch closure ("luminous absence became gift"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is consistently readable and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. However, pervasive overwriting and scaffold phrases accumulate: "hush of cosmic possibility" appears three times, "improbable longing" twice, "unassumingly bold" is asserted rather than shown, and multiple adjacent sentences restate concepts ("the truth wasn't missing, merely imprisoned" / "an idea trapped behind decades"). The climactic unlocking beat summarizes action ("her fingers weaving through the lock of hair, unbraiding fear from follicle, untangling memory from melanin") rather than dramatizing it with propulsion. Filter verbs ("could feel," "looked," "watched") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loops and template cadence ("she had freed countless ideas... but never kept one for herself" / "to one day find a key that fit her own fear") flatten momentum. Apply −0.8 for combined loops, scaffold, and summary in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is largely clear with strong concrete images (phosphorescent mushroom, rusted bow, cracking ice). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and technical detail (Pleiades, Midsummer's Eve 1983) grounds the premise. Two frictions lower the score: (1) Template cadence in the middle section—"The chronically curious..." appears three times with identical stem structure, creating a drumbeat; (2) Paraphrase loop in paragraphs describing the fairy ring, where "stored," "encrypted," and "preserved" restate the same idea across adjacent lines. The closure beat itself remains clean, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Several paraphrase loops reduce density: "the hush feels less lonely, as if the library itself is breathing" recaps earlier atmospheric work; "reversible exile becomes a choice, not a punishment" restates the prior "door swings both ways" exchange; "resilience is annotated, taught, and quietly passed on" summarizes rather than advances. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She walks… She pulls… She spreads… She finishes…" across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphor "voice like a blade wrapped in silk" and "nervous tic that now feels like a ritual of reverence" edge toward overwriting. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the final third, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "violet of a child's first laugh," "amber of a dragon's final flight," "blue of a dream's edge," "gold of a forgotten name" pile metaphor on metaphor, reducing clarity and momentum (−0.5 density; −0.4 coherence). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The waterfall sang… and the orchard rustled… In the hush of every budding hope…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "weaving the dying worlds into something new" / "weave it into the fabric of possibility itself" restate the same concept (−0.2). Stock phrasing: "radiant hush," "weight of consciousness," "living, growing thing." Total artifact deduction: −1.5 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    High figurative density without pattern-teaching: "drank starlight," "mosaic of scars," "knots dense as grief," "silence accumulated from drowned voices," "pressure she had carried," "calcified in her throat," "redistributing," "architecture now"—nearly every sentence in the first half carries metaphor, many mixed (silence accumulates *and* calcifies? spirits are pressure *and* architecture?). Template cadence in the unraveling section: "The first knot…The second knot held…the third…" reads mechanical. Paraphrase loop: "interlaced hush" appears three times with slight synonym churn (silence/hush/quiet). Clarity remains mostly intact but momentum drags under the ornamental load. Apply −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for template cadence, capped at −1.0 cumulative per the artifact penalty pack. Some strong images ("tapestry needle…eye glinting like a miniature moon") but overwriting pervades.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.3)
    Information density is generally high; sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "She traveled to the remote site, where rain-scoured fresco vaults clung to the hillside" is immediately followed by "At the exact spot where the map's tear divided known from unknown, Elena stood before the weathered stones," restating arrival without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs cluster in the chapel sequence: "Elena felt," "Elena pressed," "Elena stepped," "Elena touched," "Elena closed," "Elena felt," "Elena decided," "Elena carried"—eight "Elena [verb]" stems across nine sentences in the final third (−0.6 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule). The closure beat itself ("In her studio, Elena framed...") is clean, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 total for the two distinct issues.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with strong image work (anemones, synthetic snow, saltwater calculus) and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Two issues reduce the score: figurative language clusters in some beats without earned pattern ("singularity of memory," "museum of such returns," "vector of attachment") creating mild register drift, and the phrase "sophisticated melancholy" appears twice in slightly redundant framing. The final equations ("weight plus time, divided by acceptance") border on tell rather than embodied insight, though they fit Cassian's analytical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "encode secrets into the stone" / "messages encoded in graffiti art" / "encode the unspoken needs" / "encoded love, loss, and hope" / "encoded in the stones" cycle without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs appear ("She pressed... the glyphs flared... the ghost surged") and synonym churn (swirling glyphs, shimmering glyphs, pulsing glyphs) obscures causality. Mixed metaphors—"walls bloomed with graffiti roses, each petal a cipher"—strain coherence. Figurative density in nearly every sentence (ghost's symphony, ink and memory, living manuscript) without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("drifted upward, a luminous echo"), warranting escalated deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the ascending structure without algorithmic patterning. Information density is high: most lines advance revelation, world detail, or emotional nuance. A few constructions edge toward overwriting ("spears of light through the ice walls where they fractured into prismatic arrays") and some phrases feel template-shaped ("the weight of understanding," "the echo of memory"). The final paragraph's scaffold phrasing ("In this way, stories unfold...") is expository and tonally divergent from prior texture, reading as authorial summary rather than scene conclusion. No significant loops or redundancies; clarity and momentum hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies appropriately, with shorter sentences during the recording beat and longer, lyrical constructions in reflective passages. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]," creating mild monotony. Paraphrase loop: "Empty spaces remember because they are never truly empty—only waiting for the right witness" appears verbatim twice, once mid-story and once at the end; while the second instance functions as closure, the repetition feels mechanical rather than earned reprise. Stock metaphor: "the breathing dark" in the penultimate beat. Filter-verb stack in reflection: "she believed," "she had," "she understood" across adjacent lines. Deductions total approximately −0.8 for template stems and loops, with −0.3 additional for the filter cluster, yielding baseline ~6.9 without closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and imagistic, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade. Multiple sentences restate the limit theme without added pressure ("limits he had never imagined," "limits of his craft press back," "discovering each time where the boundary lay"). Runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Kael [verb]" structures flatten momentum. Figurative density is high throughout ("fractally precise" appears four times, "hush" three times) without escalation or taught pattern. The closure paragraph—"The end, yet beginning"—reads as tacked-on epigram rather than earned image. Accumulated artifacts and loops reach −1.2 within Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and momentum generally good, but multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "Elara's current obsession… She believed that mapping… would earn her" (adjacent restatement); "According to legend… the legend" (synonym churn); "the starlings still swirled… the starlings returned… the starlings above" (recycled stem). Stock metaphors: "dark brushstroke," "flickering clock," "faint echo." Figurative density in the opening and closing paragraphs ("captured star," "soft silver glow," "breadcrumb") accumulates without pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary adequately; grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy figurative density in most sentences ("crystal shard," "weaver of silver tumblers," "driftwood nostalgia," "winter comet," "thousand reflections sang") creates decoration rather than propulsion, applying −0.6 for overwriting. Paraphrase loops abound: "rhythm of repair" appears eight times, "hauntingly bright" four times, "driftwood nostalgia" five times, "soft hush" three times, applying −0.4 for synonym churn and template cadence. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she felt," "she recognized," "she understood") cluster in key beats, adding −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "altruistic ghost" / "altruistic desire," "shared laughter weaving bonds" / "bound by more than soil," "strangely trustworthy despite ethereal nature" / "strangely trustworthy aura." Template cadence dominates the final third with runs of "The [noun], now [modifier]" openers. Stock phrasing appears in peak beats ("shimmering mist," "silver veil," "tapestry of shared purpose"). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Figurative language (nebula, brambled hope, weaving bonds) appears frequently but vehicles contradict or blur: hope as brambled, laughter as weaving, ghost as nebula.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "nested patterns" x9, "beautifully flawed" x4, "pane of hush" x7, "bruised awe" x2. Adjacent sentences restate without added pressure: "The adjuster's bruised awe deepened" / "she was the curator of endings, yet this ending felt like a gift." Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" / "The adjuster [verb]" across multiple beats. Figurative language in most sentences (spirals, seashells, dandelion seeds, monument) without pattern-teaching creates density without clarity. Applying Q7 artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops + template stems + filter stacks = −1.4, plus final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies and propels through the nut-placement sequence; information density is high in the central beats. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "She hadn't asked for...or the whispers"; "Each tree bore fruit that soured the tongue and memories that soured the soul"; "too far down, too late in the day" echo similar constructions. The phrase "graceless beauty" appears twice in close proximity (labyrinth description and final paragraph), which reads as forced recurrence rather than earned motif. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she could let them fumble, let the curse claim") are voice-motivated but cluster in reflective beats. Proofreading is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly diverse. Clarity is generally maintained, though some figurative density stacks without payoff ("polymer chain," "symphonic whole," "harmonious ribbon" cluster in adjacent beats). Minor scaffold: "She felt the pieces fall into place" (paragraph 22) echoes the timeframe prompt phrasing. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 9 and 12 restate the polymer-weaving concept without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" pattern recurs across five beats without taught effect. Apply −0.6 for loops and stem monotony, touching final third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("glimmering parole," "incise your past," "quantifying absence") without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "Each vial glowed with erased stories, blank pages, the phosphorescence of forgotten names" restates the same content three ways without adding pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She scattered," "She measured," "She uncorked") and synonym churn ("mindfully scattered" recurs without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("stars emerging like puncture wounds") and abstract diction in peak beats ("integrated fragmentation," "archive of performed beginnings") dull immediacy. Line-level artifacts pervade the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly purposeful ("sorrow spread through the kitchen like yeast," "silence was an unspoken dream about to close"), but several metaphors strain coherence: "coral icebound" pairs contradictory materials without dramatized logic, and "unspoken dream about to close" mixes vehicles awkwardly. Template cadence appears in the subsuming sequence: "The remorse flooded… subsuming my own memories… I became a vessel"—three parallel passive constructions that dull momentum. Information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear, but the metaphor density in high-pressure beats (coral-dripping, tidal-draining) occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. The final image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    Sentence openings repeat stems: "Elara…" (×4), "The…" (×8), "She…" (×6) across adjacent paragraphs without pattern-teaching (−0.5 template cadence). Stock metaphors proliferate: "time is a river," "bridges from silos," "heart of the community." Paraphrase loops appear ("rehabilitate the clock… rehabilitate the town's listening ear"; "celestial gears had frozen… cuckoo's call swallowed by rust and time" restates stasis). Filter verbs stack in peak beats ("She had learned that to rehabilitate…"). Purple density in the festival sequence ("constellations danced," "stars aligned," "borrowed starlight") blurs concrete action. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn drag momentum: "helix-minded" appears five times, "chaotically precise" four times, "quaking" six times, "synaptic plasticity" eight times, often within adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors cloud sense: the canyon "remembered forgotten seabeds" while also serving as "neurological substrate" and "geological synaptic plasticity"—vehicles contradict. Register drifts into jargon ("synaptic junction," "superposition," "entangled network") without POV motivation. Paragraph-cut test fails: many paragraphs restate prior claims (e.g., paragraphs on "entangled memories" and "synaptic plasticity" recycle the same assertion). Filter-verb stacks ("she could modify," "she could see") dull immediacy. Elevated diction ("nexus," "phosphorescent minerals," "ozone") clashes with the absent sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "latent blaze" recurs five times without reweighting, "threshold" and "serpentine" repeat decoratively, and "seeds of vigilance" is stated twice without dramatization. Template cadence appears in the middle stretch ("She moved… She traced… She recorded…"). Figurative language ("blaze," "spark," "fire") stacks without payoff. No line-level opacity, but density and propulsion suffer from repetitive motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" sentence stems recur across dozens of lines, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear ("empathy in motion" x3, "intensely quiet" x2, "symphonically minded" x2) without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("breath of cool morning air," "cathedral of slender trunks") and filter-verb stacks ("she feels," "she imagines," "she knows") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood or theme without advancing action. These artifacts pervade the text, including the closure beat ("she continues her work, each day strumming"), triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and closure. Information density is high in many beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the eclipsed covenant replayed" and "Both promises had shattered" restate the same betrayal; "translating silence" is asserted multiple times without evolving tactics. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "Each magnetic flutter became…each silence between pulses…" Figurative language is dense throughout without always advancing scene pressure, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5 in Q7 for density and some mixed metaphors like "metaphysical vertigo").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean with vivid imagery ("shadows pooled like ink," "each bloom of color hummed with its own quiet resonance") and varied sentence rhythm in most beats. However, recurring scaffold patterns degrade momentum: "She realized" appears three times, "Mira [verb]" opens many paragraphs, and adjacent lines paraphrase the same content ("cataloguing the varieties of silence" / "describing each silence"). The workshop-silence-empathy thread is restated across multiple beats without adding new pressure. Mixed metaphor risk: "fireworks as a symphony of silence" and "explosion was the opening of empathy" blend abstract and concrete in ways that blur rather than sharpen. Stock phrases ("heart raced," "held her breath") appear in key beats. Template cadence across several "She [verb], [object]" constructions lowers density. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is lyric and rhythmic, but clarity suffers under density of figurative language. Synonym loops appear: "undercurrent of wisdom" recurs without fresh context; "wildflower hush" is invoked three times as mood label. Template cadence in the final third: "He realized... He recorded... He knew... Elias closed... Elias smiled..." stacks similar stems across six consecutive beats. Mixed metaphor: "tide's thought" as a literal sap-direction mechanic strains credibility. Paraphrase loops: the closing three paragraphs restate "serenity within motion" and "balance" without advancing pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. Artifacts touch the closure unit, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid images (silver ribbons, stone loops humming with echoes). However, several metaphors pile up in quick succession ("whirling silence...centrifuge of sound," "genetic grief," "the silence between the whirling") without always clarifying sense, creating mild overwriting in the middle third. A few template stems recur ("The arrow tip...", "The seed..."). No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is high, and the read-aloud rhythm supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple text artifacts degrade line-level control. Template cadence dominates: seven consecutive "She [verb]" openers in paragraphs 6–12, plus synonym churn ("rapidly adapting" appears twice, "singular convergence" three times). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (e.g., "the wind here was not random; it funneled through specific corridors" restates without added pressure). Peak beats rely on stock metaphors ("heavy fog," "steel skyscrapers") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt the weight," "She imagined the future"). The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than letting the image do work, and the patch metaphor "stitched into her memory" exemplifies unearned figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "sculpted hush" is re-defined across four lines without new pressure; "wonder" and "essential" recur in synonym clusters. Template cadence in the final third: "She knew that wonder…" / "And so the ice cavern…" / "And the sculptor…" Figurative density is high ("ribbon of shifting hue," "cascade of amber light," "cathedral of oscillating repose") with mixed vehicles (ribbons, cascades, cathedrals) that blur rather than sharpen. Sentence openings vary until the ending, where "And" stems stack. Information density is moderate; many lines reiterate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm and imagery are often vivid, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "The canyon hush pressed…a deep, breathless silence" then "the gorge fell into an avalanchingly quiet. Even the wind held its breath. …The canyon hush returned, deeper than before." Synonym churn around "silence" and "canyon hush" recurs without added pressure. Several runs open with "He [verb]" stems, flattening propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("He carried the flute not as a relic but as a bridge"), triggering the higher artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "He recorded the shift as a differential equation, mapping sorrow onto joy" is immediately followed by "He recorded the poet's euphoric pulse as a sine wave." Template cadence dominates the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" stems. The metaphor "each cell a feeling" in the final line is vague rather than specific. Stock phrases like "thousand masks," "borrowed personalities," and "the mathematics of emotion" recur without reweighting. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "believed") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is vivid early ("aurora-lit ridgeway stretched ahead like a blade of light") but accumulates into decorative density in the middle third without adding causal pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the pendant began to hum softly" / "the pendant began to germinate a seed" recycle the same syntactic template, and "the sprout grew into a silver-leafed tree" is stated twice verbatim across paragraphs 22 and 26. Several beats open with "The" + noun constructions in sequence, creating template cadence. Stock metaphors ("green flames," "thread lost in the wind") appear without fresh grounding, and the closing lines ("where brief encounters were extended, and where wonder was germinated") summarize theme rather than showing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the prism-frost communion sequence. However, the piece carries pervasive template cadence in exposition: "The prism had belonged..." / "The prism grew warm..." / "The prism held no magic..." and paraphrase loops in the final third ("She no longer needed to prove... she needed only to find" restates the shift already shown). The frost-into-words beat ("She was already gone before the impact") is vivid but edges into convenient symbolism. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems; no closure-scene harm, so cap deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several lines loop conceptually without adding pressure: "the silence that remained was whole now, no longer raveling but simply deep and perfect and still, a finished cloth rather than a torn one" restates the completion already shown. "A sense of completion and beginning all at once" is abstract summary where image would serve better. Metaphor occasionally strains: "clicking like a tongue learning speech again after years of dumbness" mixes the mechanical loom with organic speech in a way that muddles rather than clarifies. The final sentence's nested appositive ("a stone so polished by loss it could shine in the dark") is elegant but adds a fourth metaphor to an already-charged image, risking overwriting. Minor template cadence in the weaving sequence ("first...then...then") slightly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high and most lines advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "meek blacksmith" / "meekness had been his shield," "the arches weren't dying, they were sleeping" / "to wake what others had abandoned," and "azure dust" recurs decoratively without functional variation. Template cadence in the mine-descent paragraph ("He found… He understood… He raised…") flattens rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "grief turned inside-out" as a sound lacks sensory coherence. The closing lines ("not meek but merely quiet, his defiance no longer a question but a fact") restate the same shift twice. Figurative density in the barter beat (silk "lifting like a breath," "streamed upward… a river of light") is vivid but borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Apply scaffold and loop penalty of −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence runs through the final third: five consecutive sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating rhythmic monotony (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of the withheld truth" is restated across three adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("echo of his final act," "living force that bound her to the cycle") and elevated diction ("tangible presence," "ambient hum of distant stars") drift from the POV's established sensory lexicon. Information density is low; many sentences narrate Lira's understanding rather than advancing situation or image. The final beat summarizes closure ("ready to map the next cycle") instead of anchoring it in a concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level clarity is solid, but the text carries noticeable scaffold and repetition. "Luminescent ache" appears five times across the story without evolving function—it becomes a refrain rather than a charged motif. Paraphrase loops: "the feeling of safety" recurs in similar constructions; "warmly observant" and "quietly observing warmth" echo without adding pressure. Template cadence in the cairn sequence: "He added… He placed… He stood back…" stacks identical stems. Figurative density ("smooth as a whisper," "fragment of the ocean's heart") in consecutive lines without causal payoff. Information density is low in several beats—description restates mood rather than advancing choice. Apply −0.8 for scaffold/loop patterns plus −0.3 for figurative muddle: cumulative −1.1 from a mid-6s base.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "ancient shadows" appears ~10 times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure; "shadowed elation" recurs as synonym churn for mood; "accidentally prophetic" and "otherworldly routine" are template phrases recycled across beats (−1.0 for pervasive loops and stock-phrase stacks). Figurative language in most sentences of the climax ("needle-thin ray," "silver thread," "fabric of the night") without payoff (−0.5 density penalty). Mixed metaphor: light "slicing darkness" then "connecting lighthouse and ship" as a "thread" shifts vehicle mid-beat. Information density is low: many lines restate atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language appears in most sentences, creating density that occasionally obscures momentum: "quietly explosive" recurs as a thematic label without varied embodiment, and stock phrasing like "wind through reeds" and "liminal space" flatten specificity. Template cadence is visible in runs like "They remained watchful... Visitors began to seek them out... Each brought..." The final third layers metaphor heavily ("beacon of iridescent caution in the valley mist, where hearts and stories were exchanged with equal reverence") without advancing action, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty and high-band disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports lyric accumulation. Information density is generally high (sextant description, map reveal, garden discovery). However, paraphrase loops appear: "She wanted to know if they saw hope or only desolation" followed two beats later by "the trees had witnessed not only sorrow but also the quiet miracles." The final two paragraphs restate theme ("transform it into a map of hope") and recycle the pin image without adding pressure. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") stack in the closure third, dulling immediacy. Syntax varies purposefully; no grammar errors.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.7)
    Significant paraphrase loops: the opening fourteen paragraphs are largely restated in the final ten with synonym variation ("endless night" / "night-shrouded," "forgotten songs" / "Dawn-Weaver's Hymn," "mica window cracked" / "mica window lay in shards"). Template cadence runs appear ("He touched… He began… He sang… He felt…" in consecutive lines). Filter-verb stacks ("felt the realm's pulse," "recognized the melody") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of frayed threads," "jigsaw of stars") recur without fresh charge. Apply baseline −1.0 for loops and stems; escalate to −1.5 for artifact spread touching closure description.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: lines 10-11 restate the same paradox in adjacent sentences, lines 20-21 cycle through "nested paradoxes" again, and the final three paragraphs repeat the hiding/revealing formulation multiple times without advancing meaning. Template cadence is pervasive—many sentences follow "[Subject] was/had [state/action], [elaboration]" structure. Heavy use of abstract nouns and stacked modifiers ("the enlarged tranquility of the hour wrapped around her, a silence so vast it became music") creates figurative density that sometimes muddles rather than sharpens. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood," "she sensed") appear frequently in key beats, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's "None spoke, for speech would shatter the nested paradoxes that required silence to be heard" exemplifies overwriting where the metaphor explains itself.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language and shows strong sentence-level craft in many passages ("stone-hard...ghost of yeast and memory," "ivy had consumed the western wall"). However, several areas show template cadence and paraphrase loops: "We let it disappear. We let so many things disappear by calling it progress..." repeats structure without added pressure; "heuristically gentle" appears three times as a label without dramatization; "creeping normality...creeping erasure...Creeping normality had met its match in creeping beauty" cycles the same root metaphor. The epilogue paragraph summarizes rather than advancing, and certain high-register phrases ("liminal space," "conspiracy of silence") read as writerly overlay. Filter-verb stacks ("She'd discovered," "she'd been tending," "They'd watched") appear in sequence in the middle third, dulling immediacy. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "while illusions fade to memory" appears four times, "luminous vows" recurs in nearly every paragraph without functional variation, and the final third restates the same content across five consecutive paragraphs with minor synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., "The chief [verb]" opens six sentences in close succession), triggering the −0.4 to −0.6 deduction. Stock metaphors ("edge of oblivion," "breath of memory") and elevated diction ("conjure meaning") clash with the action-level clarity the piece claims. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and warranting escalated penalty near −1.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, varying sentence structure and paragraph length to support tension. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two pattern issues lower the score: repeated "My [noun] was [noun]" constructions ("My father's trade was silence," "My first attempt was a false start," "My second false start left me") create template cadence across key beats; figurative language is dense and occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("slick with salt and the memory of old fish" pairs concrete and abstract vehicles unevenly). The paraphrase loop "I could not stop him with force; I needed to capture the moment" → "I realized I could not stop him with force" recurs within adjacent paragraphs. No major clarity breaks, but these artifacts prevent entry to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is ambitious, with strong figurative language ("memory was a geological layer," "aurora's curtain") and purposeful sensory selection. However, overwriting appears in high-density passages: "terrestrially cosmic" recurs five times, creating a labeling loop; adjacent lines paraphrase the theme ("some phenomena must be sensed, not solved" / "some truths were meant to be sensed, not spoken"). Template cadence runs in the final third with repeated stems ("She had learned," "She would report," "She walked"). Mixed metaphor: "root-networks pulsing with votes cast in chemical whispers" conflates electrical and vocal imagery. These artifacts touch the closure beat, diluting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph structure creates visual breathing. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is generally high, though a few paraphrase loops appear: "the lock refused to yield, its internal springs corroded" immediately followed by "Frustration welled" recaps the same beat without added pressure. Template-cadence check: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "Elena [verb]" across the middle third, creating mild mechanical rhythm. Figurative language ("auroral sorrow," "tomb"/"womb") is purposeful but "surged through her veins" and "calling to sketch" edge toward stock metaphor. No major grammar, tense, or pronoun errors; clarity holds. The closure beat is free of artifacts. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems clustered in the middle; no artifacts touch closure, so mid-band placement is appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She wanted to know...so she began to search" / "She decided to transcribe...The process was slow" / "She thought of the many times...Each small lie..." (three consecutive "She [verb]" stems). Figurative language ("bruised sky," "gold leaf on parchment," "oasis of memory") recurs without fresh iteration or payoff tied to closure. Filter verbs and summary dominate peak beats: "She realized that," "She understood that," "She knew that." Information density is low—key beats (piecing the map, listening to tapes, transcribing) are narrated in summary rather than scene. The final third stacks abstractions ("candor bloomed," "oasis of memory would never dry") that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("color of wonder," "truth was not a thing to be spoken but a pattern to be revealed"), though mixed vehicles occasionally clash ("erosion as necessary cost" / "hollow out the self" in adjacent lines). Template cadence emerges: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentence stems recur across a dozen lines without variation. Paraphrase loops: "seasonally mute" is restated three times with minimal new information. Information density is uneven—the middle third describes the sculpture's mechanics at length while the child's encounter compresses rapidly. Rhythm does not modulate with the child's arrival; syntactic structure remains uniform through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and symbolic weight simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the fire sequence. Minor loop issue: "strangely organic" appears three times without always adding new pressure (ornamental in one instance). The phrase "miniaturize" / "miniaturized" recurs but with escalating function (concept → action → resolution). Some figurative language clusters densely in the burn section ("flame whispered," "precise hunger," "terror-dimensions collapsing") though it remains legible and voice-consistent. No scaffolding or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across adjacent lines: "She'd been hearing rumors...never understood why" repeats the hearing motif without added pressure; "At the next dawn, the entire courtyard gathered" then "The developer's bulldozers arrived that afternoon" are told in identical summary syntax. The phrase "sandstorm calm" is used twice with identical syntax ("voice a sandstorm calm," "The sandstorm had passed"), and the vehicle contradicts established sensory detail (jasmine, apricot light). Filter-verb stacks ("hearing a baby's cry," "hearing his mother whisper," "hearing his grandmother talk," "She'd been hearing rumors") cluster across high-pressure beats without variation. Stock metaphor: "threads," "echoes," "bricks in the wall" appear without fresh embodiment. These artifacts accumulate to −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "Each entry ended with a signature step" / "The day the spider finished its web, Lyra rolled the dice one final time" recycles the dice-roll beat; "She decided to write... each line a dance step, each step a key" / "A pirouette meant A, a leap meant B..." restates the cipher conceit. Template cadence runs ("She encoded... She performed... She emerged... She walked... She wrote... She felt") across six consecutive sentences in the final third flatten rhythm and dull momentum. Register occasionally drifts into thesis language ("alchemy of vulnerability turned strength"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("encrypt her vulnerability into strength" conflates cryptography with emotional transformation) slightly muddles sense. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence in final third (−0.6), and minor register drift (−0.3) totals approximately −1.1, and artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high, though expository blocks in the middle (paragraphs on superstitions, Old Mira's method, gravity rules) slow momentum. Figurative language is frequent and mostly clear, but metaphor density in non-peak beats ("time-lapsed glaciers," "cotton wool soaked in starlight," "ghost of sound") borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "massive silence" and "gleaming silence" echo each other. The final image ("last lantern flickered," "another whale sang") feels like a thematic flourish rather than propulsive closure. Grammar and usage are clean. Apply −0.6 for loop/scaffold (repeated stems, paraphrase of "silence" motif) and −0.3 for figurative density in middle expository beats that dull momentum rather than charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the middle third: multiple paragraphs restate "hush spreads," "code unravels," "cranes are keys" without advancing pressure. Sentence stems recur ("The smoothed hush…," "The tranquil blaze…," "The terrestrially cosmic…") across six beats, creating mechanical rhythm. Figurative language is dense (shadows as bridges, silence drinking sound, paper cutting veils) but mostly coherent. The final third tightens, but scaffolding artifacts ("some summoners worked with fire or blood, but Elias knew…") and synonym churn ("whispered secrets," "urgent whisper," "thoughtful murmur") dull momentum. Information density is uneven: the climax (final crane, absolute hush) is compressed to two sentences while crane placements stretch across redundant paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful figurative language ("well-worn manuscript page," "eyes brightened like struck flint," "meteors fell like periods"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting or theme. Weaknesses: paraphrase loops appear ("dead languages were my trade" / "dead language tutor"); "patiently nimble" recurs as an unvaried phrase across multiple beats without reweighting; template cadence in the weekly-session summary ("Mrs. Voss would pour... interrogate... respond") and minor synonym churn ("bergamot tea" / "Earl Grey" toggle without purpose). The final paragraph's recursion risks loop but stays within thematic intent. Deduct −0.6 for loops and template stems, capping shy of 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished, with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail ("velvet petals heavy with the day's last light," "spectral echo of her sister's laughter"). However, density artifacts accumulate: adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea without added pressure ("The transformation happened... that liminal moment" followed by "Elara's task was to archive... before the next dawn"), and figurative language appears in nearly every line without pattern-teaching, creating a steady hum rather than escalation. Template cadence in reflective beats ("The quarantined memory... not a containment but a cocoon") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "pressed," "heard") dull immediacy during the kneeling scene. No loops touch the closure image directly, capping deductions at mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clear and free of grammar errors, but it suffers from pervasive ornamental stacking and paraphrase loops. Lines like "The marble sanctuary glowed…a pearl twilight that turned stone into silk" and "stalactites dripped…each drop marking time like a slow heartbeat" appear multiple times with minor variation, and the phrase "marble sanctuary under aurora" recurs four times without functional reweighting. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, particularly in the closure paragraphs where "fading star," "silent storm," "chains…sundered," and "shadow among shadows" stack without advancing the image. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.4 for closure-paragraph metaphor stacking, totaling −1.2.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template-cadence runs dominate: "She sang… She listened… She uncovered… She realized… She felt… She understood… She lifted… She realized… She lowered… She walked… She smiled… She continued… She accepted" across the final two-thirds creates mechanical drumbeat (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear ("serpentine nexus" six times, "reed-blown melancholy" five times, "secret song" four times, "webs of intrigue" three times) without evolution (−0.4). Stock metaphor strings ("thread woven into the night," "veil," "web," "spiral," "tide") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is imagistic and rhythmically varied, but pervasive phrase recycling weakens momentum: "borrowed starlight" appears six times, "weaves/weaving truth carefully" four times, "windows of connection" three times, "cameo appearances" twice—each recurrence adds little new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She whispered…," "She recorded…," "She traced…," "She closed…," "She rose…") creates monotony. Mixed metaphor: "ribs jutting like broken promises" anthropomorphizes the ship uncomfortably. Several beats paraphrase without advancing (e.g., paragraphs 8–10 restate the dream-analysis method). Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (the melted globe's glass "warped" and "catching candlelight like a star"), but scaffolding remains visible. No severe clarity breaks, yet the artifact load across peak beats (shrine ritual, wreck discovery, dream ending) lowers propulsion and disallows high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "hidden patterns" recurs nine times, "whisper/whispering" eight times, "moonlight/moon path" seven times, often restating the same idea across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs through much of the piece ("He [verb], [object]; the [noun] [verb]..."). Stock metaphors ("tapestry of interwoven moonlight," "threads of cause and consequence") and elevated but empty modifiers ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") appear in nearly every paragraph without fresh meaning. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (philosopher's demonstration to Kael) obscures concrete action. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph: "testament to the enduring power of quiet observation" is thesis-speak. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "sharply observant" is both stated and demonstrated repeatedly; "the letters revealed" and "he understood now" create synonym churn around the same revelation beat. Template cadence emerges in adjacent sentences: "He'd noticed how... how the rad-count..." and "The settlers believed... They had been left... He finished... The gem sat... Council members wore..." Figurative language occasionally stacks without adding clarity: "patterns spoke louder than authority" and "choose their own curse" both appear in the final two paragraphs, diluting impact. Information density is generally high, but key discoveries are sometimes told and then re-explained rather than landing once with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is rhythmically varied and rich in imagery, but overwriting pervades high-pressure moments: "lightning painting him in static and cobalt," "lonely visionary who spoke only to ghosts in the static," and dense metaphorical phrasing in nearly every sentence of the transmission sequence. Paraphrase loops appear—"variant allegiance" recurs without added nuance; "fragmented frequencies" and "static" are restated multiple times. Template cadence in the final third: "The dawn broke... a child... began to speak... Atlas watched... his work complete, his loneliness finally a kind of company" stacks declarative summary without propulsion. Figurative density in the climax (−0.5) and loops (−0.4) plus modest scaffold in the ending (−0.2) compound to −1.1, dropping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyric patterning ("dawn's earliest whistle") and sensory specificity ("varnish peeled like old sunburn," "notes stain the page") create texture, but multiple artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "She couldn't bear to lose it. / That's when she remembered..." recaps motivation already implied. Template cadence in the jar-filling section: "Some contained... Others held... A few jars caught... One jar captured..." runs four parallel stems without payoff. Register drift: "gleaned redemption," "currency of loss," and "invisible architecture" elevate diction beyond the established voice in peak beats. The phrase "the vagrant penny poet, positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" stacks modifiers that blur rather than sharpen. Combined artifact penalty and mid-passage sluggishness prevent higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated abstraction ("sorrow's geometry," "vibrational matching," "ethereal hand pressing against her ribs"). In the climactic beat, density obscures propulsion: "Together they formed a chord of sonic absolution, forgiveness made not of words but of perfect resonance that rewrote the creature's code" is a three-part metaphor cascade. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 31–32 repeat the closure idea (artifact fulfilled, prayers answered). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure image, triggering the lower penalty tier. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "unyoke" and "unyoking" recur eight times without added pressure; "patient revolution" appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across consecutive paragraphs. Mixed metaphors: "restrained wildness" as "a river dammed until its power could reshape stone" conflates fluidity with geological force unconvincingly. "Horizons of possibility" and "sky's hunger met the ice's silence" pile figurative language densely in early beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closing image—"the outline of every future she had helped to free"—is abstract rather than concrete, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clarity is high and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("break the controlling influence" / "sever the leash" / "pull her back under his control") and templated sentence openings ("She carried," "She recorded," "She uploaded," "She left," "She clutched"). Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "slow breath," "chains," "tight leash," "beacon," "tide of complicity." The mixed metaphor of truth rising "like water" after ending a drought contradicts the premise (water already returned). These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, with strong images like "dust motes swirled in the slanted afternoon light" and "the silence louder than any scream." However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic echo: "the calm before realization" appears twice, "second opinion" is recycled conceptually, and "aptly deliberate" is forced into the final third as callback. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing in peak beats ("grace that must be built gear by gear," "the method by which we see what needs repairing"), dulling immediacy. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("not by undoing…but by making"; "not the easy kind, but the grace that…"), and the final paragraph stacks summary sentences that restate closure rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is inventive and image-dense, with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high: most lines advance world, character, or concept. However, some figurative language verges on overwriting—"theoretical resonance pinwheeling through the workshop's evolving codebase" and "impossible goal" stack abstractions in quick succession. A minor paraphrase loop appears: "the workshop shuddered" / "the machinery began to build" / "It was forging" recycles the same beat across three sentences without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks harm peak moments, and the closure image ("the arrow tip had become the tongue of a god") remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "She knew the corporation had buried the truth in the same place it buried its deleted files" immediately follows the vault discovery without new information; "The numbers continued to surface" / "The numbers would keep appearing" / "she whispered the numbers" recycle the same content. Runs of "She [verb]" stems dominate (she poured, she realized, she decided, she watched, she knew, she uploaded, she whispered). Stock metaphors ("digital graveyard," "ghosts in its wires," "beacon for anyone searching") and therapy-speak abstractions ("sensed absence," "echo of forgotten songs" repeated verbatim five times) appear in peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster across multiple lines. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: template cadence (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.4), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (−0.5) totals −1.9, but capping at −1.7 because artifacts touch the closure beat. Additional disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The weighted breath before reply fogged the air" recurs three times with synonym variations but no added pressure. Template cadence runs in the mirror sequence: "The first mirror showed... The second showed... The third mirror flickered." Stock metaphors ("shadows coiled," "tears freezing") and thesaurus inflation ("reconstituting, threads weaving") dull immediacy. The final third stacks abstractions that obscure the closure image's specificity, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    Recurring phrases and template constructions accumulate: "She [verb]" sentence stems dominate, and figurative language ("lace tip a ghost," "ice groan...a deep resonant sigh," "wind...a chorus of whispers") appears in nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops: "the sound of approaching endings" appears four times with minimal variation, and "windborne solace" recurs as decorative refrain. The final third stacks these motifs mechanically rather than charging them with new pressure, triggering the high-density artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops accumulate: paragraphs 8–9 restate the vine metaphor ("mismatched pairs," "reluctant union," "thriving, others withering") without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in paragraph 18–20 ("He wrote of the vine…," "In nurturing intersubjective understanding…," "He tucked the singed edge…"). Figurative density in most sentences ("like honey," "like the scent of late harvest wine," "a warm ember in his chest") blurs rather than sharpens peaks. Filter verbs ("He realized," "He saw," "He smiled, feeling") stack without voice motivation. Information density is low; multiple paragraphs circle the same thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "murmuring pavilion" appears in 8 lines, "echo of wisdom" in 7, "kinetic parapet" in 9, "whisperfield calm" in 6, often in identical syntactic slots without added detail or pressure. Template stems dominate: "The [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" recur in nearly every paragraph. Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("seeds," "vessel," "thread," "hymn," "lullaby," "heart," "fabric") without coherent vehicle or pattern payoff. Scaffold phrases ("thus," "and the," "in the") stack without propulsion. Information density is low—most sentences restate the same action (preserve echo, parapet pulses) across 47 lines. Stock metaphors ("seeds," "thread in the fabric") appear without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The arcs in black-and-white photographs told stories" / "arcs in black-and-white photographs that resembled the lavender's own flowering patterns" / "via arcs in black-and-white photographs." Template cadence runs through summary blocks ("It was then she would linger," "In this way, collective healing became," "And so the subtle puzzle archivist continued"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("topography of memory," "weaver at a loom," "cathedral of remembrance"). Filter-verb stacks ("could almost hear," "would linger") dull immediacy in peak moments. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 in Q7 for loops, template runs, and stock phrasing; −0.6 additional for presence in final third, total −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high: nearly every line advances discovery, world-state, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "ink bleeding through paper," "dust motes...like forgotten letters." Minor cluster of scaffold in mid-section: "The pattern emerged slowly" (line 13) followed by summary of that pattern; "he realized" (line 15) is a light filter but fits voice. One paraphrase slip: lines 17–18 restate the library's dimming without added pressure. No loops in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is clean. The "suspended hush" recurs purposefully rather than as filler.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid without overwriting. However, template cadence dominates: "He [verb]" opens nine consecutive beats in the middle third without variation, creating a drumbeat monotony (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: lines 4–5 restate "forgetting futures" in adjacent sentences; lines 22–23 echo "ghost echo" and "slow sigh" without added pressure (−0.3). The chalk-snap moment is crisp, but the final five paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the release, flattening closure momentum. No figurative muddle, but information density sags in the ending and scaffold phrasing ("a small proof," "a quiet percussion") pads several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "foundations shook"/"foundations no longer shaking," "clock hand spun wildly"/"clock hand still spun"/"clock hand rested," "luminous ache" recycled across five beats without evolving pressure. Template cadence runs: "Kael knew" × 3, "The leaf" × 3, "He knew" × 2. Stock metaphors ("heart a quiet drum," "canvas for…dying suns") and abstract intensifiers ("changelessly constant," "ephemeral whisper") reduce clarity at peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure sequence (final three paragraphs), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose carries consistent lyricism but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. "The scent of hope" is defined, then repeated with slight variation three times without added pressure. Stock metaphors—"quiet of a man who had already begun to say goodbye," "bridge built from recollection"—appear in high-stakes beats without fresh embodiment. Lines like "pulsing stillness" and "radiant haven" recur as labels rather than earned images. Synonym churn: "reunify," "reunified," "bridge," "carried," "woven," "tapestry" stack without distinct function. The final third loops thematic summary ("the scent of hope lingered," "a place where every farewell could be a masterpiece") instead of advancing scene pressure. Apply −1.0 for patterned artifacts (paraphrase, stock metaphor strings, thematic echo loops) and −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe appropriately; information density is moderate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had to relearn the final loop, a pattern she had only seen once before. It required a reversal of the first loop..." restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She began... The automaton responded... Shadows... flickered... She realized...") create mechanical pacing. Minor clarity issues: "spoons bent reality" is intriguing but unexplained, and "sealed awakening" remains abstract. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalty accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm, but several artifacts lower the grade: "yearning" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs, "bone setting" is over-explained, and "edifice crumbled" + "cleft in certainty" lean purple. Template phrasing: "She found... She pushed... Elena saw..." runs in the garden entrance sequence. Information density is high in the tooth revelation but sags in the reflective middle. The final telescope image is vivid and propulsive. No major loops, but figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching in the closure beat (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "pearl of stillness" recurs nine times without evolving meaning; "serpentine grotto in mist" appears five times as static anchor. Multiple sentences restate without adding pressure: "She had found a way to give light without flame, a gift of pure reflection. The pearl of stillness remained, a silent sentinel..." Figurative density is high but often redundant: "a quiet mission rising like dawn," "a pearl of stillness," "a universe of stillness." Template cadence in final third: "Each piece...a new pearl. The village grew...Each one a quiet story." These loops dull momentum and obscure the closure image. Syntax varies purposefully in early beats but flattens into summary rhythm late.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is syntactically varied and clear, with vivid concrete images (fossilized sap, bee hives in cables, moss spirals). However, significant overwriting clusters appear: "cathedral of quiet decay," "honeyed hush," "drip of thawing icicles," "constellations on damp concrete," and "grafting new meaning onto old wounds" accumulate metaphoric density without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to escalation. Paraphrase loops recur—"the weight felt different—almost purposeful" and "the familiar weight of the pendant settle into place" restate pendant-as-burden across beats. Template stems ("She was," "She had," "She would") appear in runs. Apply −0.8 for density + loops, capping mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe loop and scaffold debt. Prompt phrases recur as decorative anchors without advancing pressure: "lucidly watchful" (lines 3, 14, 24, 34), "against the current" (lines 4, 10, 20, 25, 36, 38), "ephemeral cameo appearances" (lines 5, 19, 28), "swirling hush" (lines 14, 15, 23, 30, 37), "inside the whisper of closing pages" (lines 3, 10, 19, 29, 33, 39). Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs: "He + [verb]" stems repeat without variation. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence (mist coils, ink wades, laughter spirals, paper turns to fog) without coherent vehicle logic—mist as question mark, shell as period, nexus as reader. Mixed metaphors and synonym churn ("ephemeral," "fleeting," "brief") obscure propulsion. The closure beat ("pressed the shell into earth as a scribe presses a final period") is itself a metaphor, reducing the physical act's immediacy. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template cadence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Minor scaffold appears: "The tendril stretched, coiling anew" and "a fresh sprout emerged" restate vine revival across adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). "Gathering hush" recurs as a phrase without evolving meaning, reading as motif-checklist rather than pressure accumulation. Figurative density ("golden threads," "breath of a song," "sacred silence") is high but legible and voice-consistent. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (e.g., "toolbox rattling" conveys both object and character trait).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("liquid mercury," "quiet tide of grief and hope"). Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "moving stillness" recurs four times without added pressure; "the stillness moved" (paragraph 16) and "the moving stillness" (paragraph 20) restate the same image. Paragraph 19 repeats the concept of sealing/transformation across three lines without advancing causality. Minor scaffold: "She stood, the plate in hand, and sensed" (paragraph 21) recaps position redundantly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the loops touching mid-scene and closure beats lower the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete nouns (tuning forks, rose quartz, mercury pendulum) and vivid phrases ("marble that sweat condensation," "secret rivers"). However, multiple scaffold and loop patterns accumulate: "reflection angles at different times" appears three times nearly verbatim, "peripherally focused" is invoked four times with minimal variation, and "wounded season" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions ("He decided," "He spent," "He installed"). Paraphrase loops occur ("studying reflection angles" → "charted the cavern's acoustic memory" → "measuring how each angle captured a different era"). Figurative language is occasionally strained ("lull of a wounded season," "cellar of reason") but does not obscure clarity. Information density is high in the angle-mapping beats, yet summary phrases ("spent days," "worked without haste") compress key actions that warrant scene. Apply −0.8 for loop/scaffold accumulation (three distinct issues); final-paragraph artifacts are absent, so no disqualification trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("boundary-lessly," "shingled hush," "kerosene lamp burner...twisted into a shape that remembered fire"). While coherent and voice-consistent, the lushness flattens momentum: "slowly, the voice calcified into a translucent crystal, its weight barely that of a sigh, yet dense with unshed tears" stacks modifiers without propulsion. Paraphrase appears: "the grotto exhaled a shingled hush that finally, after all this time, became true silence" restates the hush-to-silence shift already implied. No loops or scaffold break causality, but density dulls urgency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clarity is generally high; sentences are grammatical and spatial choreography tracks. However, the text exhibits paraphrase loops: "here-and-gone pulse" / "here and gone" / "both here and gone" recurs without added pressure. Phrases like "hauntingly practical" appear three times, and "rust-hued peace" is restated in multiple beats without functional reweighting. Template cadence in the final third: "She realized... She had learned... And so the lion remained..." Stack of filter constructions ("She could feel," "She imagined," "She understood") in reflective beats dull immediacy. Figurative density ("like smoke," "like a whip crack," "like dew," "like water through the crystal") clusters without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("echoes of abandoned wishes," "stone in my throat"). However, several near-paraphrase loops appear: "fractured by the silence" / "fractured stillness," "fragments" / "shards" / "pieces" recur without reweighting, and "eroded ambitions" / "ambitions I had let erode" within short spans. Template stems ("I [verb]" openings) cluster in the middle third, reducing propulsion by ~−0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or causality breaks. Yet the prose carries template cadence: "She [verb]...She [verb]...She [verb]" runs through paragraphs 11–16 without variation, and several beats paraphrase the same content ("the terminal inhale," "reborn," "resurrecting wonder"). Figurative density is high without always advancing pressure: "soft thunder of tiny engines," "heart a quiet engine," "numbers sing of renewal." These patterns dull momentum in the middle third, though they do not obscure the closure image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffold phrases like "she decided," "she realized" pad transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    "Excruciatingly gentle" appears six times, "glacial hush" four times, "petrichor nostalgia" three times, creating a template cadence and decorative loop that dulls immediacy in peak beats (final gear placement, sunrise reveal). Adjacent sentences paraphrase: "The sanctuary remained soundless, yet it was no longer silent" / "a lullaby of gears and rain and sunrise" restates the transformation without added pressure. Register is consistent but the repetitive adverbial phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle touch," "excruciatingly gentle way," "excruciatingly gentle peace") functions as label rather than varied embodiment. Information density is moderate; some lines (e.g., "a perfume of memory and forgiveness") do double duty, but scaffold phrases like "she had come to bear" and "she would return" narrate intent without propulsion. No loops obscure causality, and clarity remains high, preventing deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the architecture of lies" appears six times, "hindsight clarity" twice in identical phrasing, "thoughtfully clear" twice, "antique pocket sundial" four times with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates the second half: "She recalled… She tucked… She unfolded… She traced…" Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh collision: "veil between truth and lie," "tangled threads," "brick in a greater edifice." Scaffold sentences like "Her mission was to salvage truth from the tangled threads of those deceptions" restate the prompt rather than advance scene pressure. The closing paragraph summarizes theme rather than dramatizing image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high in the decoding sequence. However, repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "infinitely patient" appears three times, "oceanic hush" twice, and scaffold phrases recur ("the secret weavers," "the fulgurite glass" as standalone sentence subjects). Mixed metaphor in "fractal fury" (geometric/emotional) and "rope's living memory" (inanimate/organic) jars without payoff. Several paraphrase loops (e.g., "coax the final pattern" / "coaxed knowledge forward" / "coaxed the rope back") and the final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("everything that had been and might yet grow") dull the closure image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, repetitive proper-noun stems −0.3, mixed metaphor −0.3, total −1.0 in band, plus an additional −0.3 for scaffold touching the final beat = baseline ~7.9, adjusted to 6.9.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs reduce momentum: "geography of healing" appears in paraphrase four times; "lonesome splendor" echoes three times; "thread as story/lifeline" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]..." runs across seven consecutive paragraphs without variation. Figurative density is high but often mixed or vague ("seeds of memory could sprout," "tapestries hanging like frozen breath"). Line-level clarity is adequate but momentum drags due to synonym churn and repetitive stems. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "bitterly sweet" appears three times, "quaking reverie" twice, "flawed genesis" three times, "giant stalactites" twice, and "hypothesized" twice—all without pattern-teaching or payoff in varied context. Template cadence in the final third: "He understood… He hypothesized… He resolved… He stood…" across successive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("spark of the old world," "bridge between two worlds") reduce specificity. Grammar and punctuation are clean, but information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. "The palace… swayed gently" and "The palace groaned" in adjacent paragraphs describe the same effect.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "scars can sing" appears four times, "unyielding compassion" three times, "migrating clouds" four times, often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half ("She [verb]… She [verb]…" across eight consecutive sentences). Mixed metaphor: "scars…shimmer, as if the fire's memory had turned to music" conflates visual, thermal, and auditory domains. Stock phrases ("kelp-drift peace," "testament to survival") recur without fresh coloring. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "Kael's plan relied on sidereal patience" followed immediately by explanation of sidereal patience, then restated via star-tracking. Template cadence runs appear ("She followed… The breadcrumbs led… At the edge… Nestled within…"). Stock metaphors ("embers of a star," "liquid light") and synonym churn ("hush" / "silence" / "quiet" cycle) dull momentum. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, with an additional −0.3 for stock figurative language in the opening and closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is dense and imagistic with purposeful compression; information density is high. However, several paraphrase loops recur: "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears five times, becoming template rather than motif; "troubling serenity" and "sonar pinging" repeat without evolving meaning. Figurative language is consistent (computational metaphor, light/fire opposition) but occasionally stacks without clarifying action: "approximated infinity in its recursive bloom" adds texture without advancing situation. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with pressure. No major grammar or coherence breaks, but the repetitive anchors and elevated diction in peak beats create mild momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing: "The greenhouse at dusk became his workshop, where stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence" closely echoes prior greenhouse description; "the woven ribbon roll" appears as a repeated phrase across multiple paragraphs without functional variation. Template cadence appears in the list-like summary of ribbon discoveries ("Dickinson's hope, Neruda's sorrow"). Figurative language is controlled, though "thundering calm" recurs without clear payoff. No major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high; most sentences advance character and atmosphere. Rhythm varies well, with short beats at peak moments ("She could erase… Or she could honor…"). Minor pattern noted: several sentences open with subject-verb-object template in the tower-winding sequence, creating slight template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "time itself hold its breath" and "the pause was ending" restate the pendulum metaphor without added pressure. Figurative language is generally purposeful ("black glass that sang," "burning mirrors") but "weighted every citizen's conscience" feels slightly stock. No major loops or scaffolding; prose remains clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "shape of intentions" recurs five times with minor variation; "velveteen gloom" appears four times in identical phrasing; "tenderly organized" is used twice in near-identical constructions. Lines 11–13 restate the same idea (decoding threads to seek hidden language). Template cadence in the mid-section ("He traced," "He felt," "He wondered," "He pictured," "He sat," "He placed," "He stepped") flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("silent plea," "labyrinth," "whispered confession") cluster without fresh vehicle. Figurative density in the silo sequence (lines 16–30) does not teach a pattern or pay off at closure. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter/label churn = baseline ~4.2. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph (line 40 recycles "uncharted echoes"), triggering the −1.7 threshold and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the modeling passages ("thermal expansion coefficients, the flexion limits of obsidian, the patience of elders measured in moon cycles"). However, mild scaffold persists: "Her method was predictive modeling" followed two lines later by "Now, before the pen met the blank page, she ran each scenario through her mind's lattice" restates the same process without added pressure. The multi-year epilogue summarizes transformation in list-like transitions ("Over the following years," "And the frozen lake remained") rather than dramatizing one crystallizing cost, dulling propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, with vivid images (cobalt pulse, shimmering staves, thistled calm). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "She believed… She imagined… She prayed… She whispered" anchor consecutive paragraphs, and the dust-as-storyteller motif is restated across five separate beats without added pressure. Figurative density is high but repetitive (dust, glow, mist, cloak recur as static descriptors), and the final third doubles down on summary rather than propulsion. Information density is moderate; momentum flattens in the second half as the same images recirculate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "crystallize a fleeting emotion" / "the fleeting emotion she sought to crystallize"; "weaves truth carefully" appears twice verbatim; "somber marvel" recurs four times without reweighting. Template cadence ("She [verb]" openings) runs across eight sentences in the second half, triggering −0.5. Figurative language stacks without coherence ("mirage of safety," "trick of light and shadow," "shimmer," "dissolve," "haze") in adjacent lines, muddling clarity (−0.4 for density without payoff). Scaffolding phrases ("for a moment," "yet in the quiet," "but for now") pad rather than propel. Total artifact penalty −1.0; no 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme simultaneously. The opening line anchors stakes ("corpse-bloat three months after the plague ended"); the closing image ("quiet rebellion in the ruin's heart") recharges the cog motif. Minor scaffold appears: "Malach would not be remembered, but the cog would tell its own story" restates the prior beat's implication without added pressure (−0.2). A few figurative phrases ("time devours all things, but it was human teeth doing the devouring now") read slightly elevated but remain voice-consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Rhythm varies across beats, and sentences like "The chord they built was imperfect but intentional, each strand necessary" achieve clarity and concision. However, template stems recur: "She knew," "She had," "She taught," "Mrs. Kaelin [verb]" across multiple paragraphs, creating cadence drag. Paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing art," "vanishing faster," "A vanishing art, yes") and the phrase "expectantly resigned" repeats three times without added pressure. The high density of metaphor (rosette, braiding, negative space, traveled stillness) in the final third risks overwriting; some lines ("veined like the rosette's channels—nature's own carving") feel decorative rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "gentle rebellion" recurs four times without added pressure; "informal wisdom" is restated; "beauty from ruins" echoes across paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle section: "She [verb]… She [verb]… She [verb]" across five consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("symphony of memories," "tapestry of laughter") cluster in the fruit-tasting beat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, and an additional −0.3 for stock phrases in the closure beat (−0.9 total). Final third artifact disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high, and the prose generally propels: the honeycomb reveal, the tower climb, and the activation sequence advance without padding. However, the piece carries template-cadence runs ("She thought of the matchbox riddle, how truth had opened the box, how memory—of wonder, of routine transformed—had become the key") and some paraphrase loops (the drones' failure is explained twice, first via "lack of wonder" then again via "never taught to marvel"). Stock metaphors like "dead stars" and "threads of honey" appear in proximity without fresh inflection, and the final third layers figurative language densely enough to soften momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "houses feel alive" / "houses breathe easier" / "houses...hummed with a low breath" recycle the same claim across a dozen lines without added pressure. Template cadence dominates with "He [verb]" and "The creeping normality noticer [verb]" stems repeated mechanically. Stock metaphors ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze") appear in most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drifts into abstract elevation ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify") mismatched to the POV's practical task. Synonym churn ("displaced objects," "shards of hush," "rite," "prayer") substitutes for causal linkage. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph directly, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (foxgloves as both poison and cure, stone heart quickening). Clarity is high in the opening half; the final third becomes more abstract with phrases like "slow green pulses" and "ancient light" that lean toward purple without breaking intelligibility. One paraphrase loop: "animate lifeless" appears in multiple sentences doing identical thematic work without added pressure. Template cadence in the epilogue: "Petra would be ready... Petra thought... Petra breathed" stems recur across four lines. Information density is strong in the middle (ampoule cascade, dome weakness, gardener's rebellion compressed efficiently) but thins in the ending's lyric summary. No filter-verb stacks or grammar errors. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, slight overwriting in final third −0.3; total −0.9 within Q7 under the non-closure accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high, but template cadence runs appear: "He'd tried… he'd accepted… he'd missed… he'd spent" clusters in the exposition block, and "So he walked, and he calculated" signals list-like sequencing. The double-sixes reversal and the chipped die's three-face landing are vivid, but surrounding lines lean on stock metaphors ("texture of a missed opportunity," "shuddered," "settled into a new rhythm"). Figurative density in the exposition ("architecture violated every law," "dissolve," "texture felt like these cold steps") slightly overloads without pattern-teaching. No loops touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and carries vivid images, but suffers from recurring scaffold and template cadence: "He was an insomniac painter who believed...," "His tool was...," "He understood that...," "The lost languages he painted were no longer lost; they lived in..." These stems and the reliance on list-like exposition ("a formula he had perfected through countless sleepless trials," "a tradition of her homeland that signified gratitude") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("insomnia became a ritual" / "insomnia persisted, but it was now a willing sentinel"). Filter verbs ("felt his heart rouse," "seemed to hum") cluster without voice motivation. The overwriting is consistent but not dense enough to obscure causality, so penalties remain within Q7. Figurative language ("pocket of green breathing," "moon-tipped brush") is vivid but occasionally mixed (does the brush tip shimmer or glow?). Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job rather than layering action, image, and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "rescue dying arts" / "rekindling a lost cultural voice"; "rosewater dread" appears three times as unvaried label; "the emerald-tinted opera glass lens" / "emerald-tinted lens" / "the emerald-tinted lens" cycles without purpose. Template cadence in the final third: "She knew... Yet... And though... So she kept... And every morning... Thus... And so..." creates mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("silent tomb," "quiet pulse," "fragile hope") cluster in closure beats. Figurative density in peak moments (ice thaw, harp's first note) obscures concrete action. Sentence openings repeat: "She decided," "She placed," "She resolved," "She kept."

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and often vivid ("beard of kelp," "rotten heart," "liquid silver"), but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and decorative restatement. Lines like "She had stepped beyond fate's design, and in that defiance, she found a purpose as sharp as a lighthouse beam" and "The world beyond the island remained shrouded in fog, but she had learned to find light within the gloom" repeat the same thematic claim without adding new pressure. The final third accumulates synonym churn ("latent radiance" recurs six times, "slow exhale of low tide" four times) and template cadence ("She gathered," "She carried," "She left") that dulls momentum. These artifacts cluster near closure, preventing high-band entry and triggering the global 9+ disqualifier. Information density is uneven: early beats are tight, but the ending expands into scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops touch multiple beats: "Their beauty was a lie that made her stomach clench, an allure that pulled at her even as it repulsed" restates repulsive-allure within one sentence; "The photograph in her pocket now showing only empty glass" echoes "the mirrors would forever reflect only what they were—empty glass" two paragraphs later. Template cadence appears in the advisor's riddles, but that reads voice-motivated. Figurative density spikes without pattern-payoff: "oily residue," "corrupted gold," "bruised twilight," "skeletal," "plywood grin peeling," "pearl erupted with pure, harsh light" cluster in quick succession, some mixing metaphors (grin/skeletal/plywood). Filter-verb reliance ("showed," "revealed," "seemed") dulls immediacy in mid-beats. Stock metaphor "blood" in the opening feels placeholder. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work—but scaffold phrases ("she found," "she stepped," "she pulled out") repeat sentence stems across the funhouse sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence ("bruised underside of cumulus," "lullaby with teeth," "indigo ink"), creating texture but flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 10–11 restate fractal generating without added detail; paragraphs 22–23 loop the transformation-into-dialogue idea. Template cadence runs through "She struck... She moved... She could see..." stems. Information density is high but propulsion is sluggish; several beats narrate the same conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity holds throughout. Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third: "She began to see it…"; "The crack in the whistle wasn't damage—it was a map"; "Following its fracture lines…"; "If she could replicate it…"; several adjacent blocks open with "The" or "She" in mechanical alternation. Paraphrase loop: "quietly driven by the need to map" (paragraph 2) echoes "Kael was quietly driven, yes" (paragraph 34) without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stacking in expository beats. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and loops combined; artifacts do not touch the closure carving scene, so no additional caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.3)
    Syntax varies and grammar is clean; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Orientation is immediate. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "Each rusted rail mirrored…each cracked window a silenced voice" and "She thought of how the station…In the same way, the historical narrative" deliver parallel structure that becomes formulaic. The phrase "drawing parallels" recurs across three paragraphs without progression. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh embodiment: "noble lie," "pit of lies," "living archive," "bridge between." Information density is moderate—several sentences restate the thematic parallel without advancing situation or choice. High-priority beats (letter discovery, colleague debate) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance setting, action, or emotional charge—and syntactic variety supports momentum through the inspection, note-writing, and cornerstone sequence. However, patterned artifacts cluster in the final third: "interlaced absence" / "interlaced presence" becomes a conceptual loop; "hushed blaze" recurs as stock metaphor; "stoically sensitive" and "wrest" are prompt-label insertions that feel template-driven rather than organic discoveries. The closing paragraph's elevated, abstract diction ("human ambition's sediment, where absences interlace, waiting for stoic, sensitive hands to wrest them into light") reads as summary rather than dramatized image, dulling closure immediacy. These artifacts touch the final beat, triggering a combined −1.2 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, and spatial choreography tracks across beats. However, figurative language is dense and often ornamental: "dappled shadows," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness" recur without reweighting meaning or constraining choice. Phrases like "the silence around her was a dappled resolve" and "tranquilly perceptive calm" elevate register without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in multiple "She [verb]" stems, and paraphrase loops ("reclaimed stillness" appears six times with minimal variation). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, preventing entry into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text. Lines 9–10 restate "searching for innocence" in synonym churn; lines 14–15 loop "fold/crease/descent/ascent" without added pressure. Paragraph-long runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems ("She worked," "She descended," "She found," "The method," "The polishing," "The shadow") flatten rhythm (−1.0). Figurative density is high ("wound becoming instrument," "each callus a successful transformation") but vehicles often contradict physics (cranes that "sang" and "flew and fell" without clear mechanism). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she placed it inside a final lantern") with summary rather than scene (−1.7 total in Q7; disallow 9+ globally).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). Deduct −0.8 for template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "[Noun] + past-tense verb" (e.g., "The geode warmed," "The system chimed," "The observatory hummed"), creating a drumbeat pattern. Additional −0.3 for paraphrase loop: "Her twenty minutes were up" duplicates information already conveyed by "one minute remaining" and the chime. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "galaxy of unspent futures" borders on overwrought but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("limestone walls drank light and returned only shadow," "orrery's shadow loomed like a spider's web"). However, synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear: "perpetually surprised" is restated three times, "brilliant dimness" recurs without evolving pressure, and several beats offer decorative rather than propulsive detail (e.g., "Her perpetual surprise had finally found an answer in the missing pieces, though new questions bloomed like nebulae"). Template cadence in the final third ("Tomorrow would bring…"; "And Elara…would be ready") and stock metaphors ("questions bloomed like nebulae") lower the score. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, but scaffold remains.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs 3, 10, and 11 restate "sieved hush" and "weight" with synonym churn. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun], [descriptor], [verb]…" stems. Stock metaphors proliferate: "guilt rose like a tide," "truth struck him with the weight of a collapsing wall." The final paragraph ("And so the genealogist walked…") reads as scaffolding summary rather than scene. Baseline deduction of −1.2 for loops, cadence, and stock images; additional −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies across sentence lengths, and figurative language (moon as scythe, drawer pull as hinge) serves thematic work without overcrowding. Several loops appear: "uncommonly thoughtful" repeated for both Kael and Lin; "furrowed hush" appears twice in similar framing. The final paragraph stacks summary assertions ("fragile trust," "cycle of moon phases") that deflate closure momentum. No template cadence or register drift, but information density drops in the last third as reflection replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but multiple beats rely on template-like parallel constructions: "The first utility pole…second pole…third pole…fourth pole…fifth pole…sixth." This scaffold creates a predictable cadence rather than organic propulsion. Several phrases loop conceptually: "expectations collapse" appears twice; "merrily melancholic" is repeated in nearly identical phrasing at open and close. Figurative density is high throughout—"compass needle that had stopped spinning," "dead weight of regrets," "monuments to human persistence," "strange gravity of forgiveness"—without always advancing scene pressure. The loop and metaphor density in the closure paragraph slightly dull the final image's charge. Applying template-cadence (−0.4) and paraphrase-loop (−0.2) penalties within Q7, plus metaphor saturation in peak beats (−0.3), totaling roughly −0.9.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the baseball was not a mere souvenir; it was a key" (line 10) / "the baseball, now a talisman, would be his instrument, a bridge" (line 40); "jaded wonder stirring" (line 13) / "jaded wonder" (line 25); "delicately robust" (line 14) / "delicately robust hope" (line 39). Template cadence dominates lines 26–30: "He understood…," "With the baseball…," "The labyrinth…," "He glanced…," "Kael smiled…" Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "drumbeat of jaded wonder" (line 25), "seeds of empathy in barren hearts" (line 39), "chasm of indifference" (line 40). The final third (lines 32–41) is scaffolded with repeated "even in…" constructions and filter verbs ("he felt," "he glimpsed," "he clenched"), dulling immediacy at closure. Information density is low—many sentences restate prior knowledge without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "She had come not for the fruit, but to reforge a bond…" / "She had found the slip of paper years ago…" / "She felt the reluctant metamorphosis begin…" / "She felt her voice change…" / "She knew that each night…" / "She taught the young fox-cubs…" / "She often looked at the fortune's fragile paper…" / "She felt within her…" The closure beat itself suffers stock metaphor ("love now a constellation, each star a memory") and rhythm fatigue. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation. Information density is low: adjacent sentences restate the same transformation without added pressure. Apply Text-Artifact Screen: −1.4 baseline for pervasive loops and template stems, escalate to −1.7 for touching closure, and disallow 9+ globally with high-band cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in most sentences ("clouds pooled like liquid obsidian," "breath of ancestors," "threads of memory weaving through the crack"). Many are coherent individually but the accumulation blurs momentum, especially in peak beats where the crack "weeps," hair "becomes threads," and the glade "dissolves." Paraphrase loops appear: "lost time accumulates" is restated four times across the piece. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive sentences mid-story. Information density is moderate; many lines describe texture without advancing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high in most beats. Strong moments: "She would stitch them together—not metaphorically, but with a needle threaded with monofilament spun from the ship's decaying warp core." Weaknesses accumulate: paraphrase loops appear ("the weight of her own violence…pressing her to the deck" / "heavy with corruption"), stock metaphors recur without transformation ("stars hung like unanswered prayers"), and gravitational mechanics are restated across multiple paragraphs. The closure image mixes metaphors: "gravitationally light with purpose, heavy with love" contradicts the established physics. Deduct −0.8 for loops and mixed metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("living ember," "constellation of small sacrifices"). However, the piece exhibits mild overwriting: elevated diction in almost every sentence without pattern-teaching ("subsonic thunder," "phosphorescent insects," "celestial bodies in rare conjunction") and occasional mixed metaphor (sand "whispered" but also created "hush that vibrated"). Paraphrase loop appears: "he gave his time" and "he gave his attention" restate the same idea across paragraphs. The scaffold phrase "Kael knew none of this, busy as he was" is expository summary that could be cut. Template cadence in the retrospective section ("He'd given… He'd given…") is purposeful parallelism but borders on formulaic. Information density is high, but the lush register slightly dulls propulsion in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, but several beats carry paraphrase loops: "intrigue had coated the fort" is echoed by "intrigue had found its instrument" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She measured… she reset… she polished…" stacks similar stems. Figurative density is high throughout—"winking hush," "cradle of sparks," "luminous promise"—occasionally blurring immediacy in action beats. The final paragraph's "opened tomorrow itself" tips into abstraction. Information density is high; most lines advance situation or image. No filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks touch the closure, so deductions remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.7)
    Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated register ("blackened spine," "whispers of ancient eels," "shards of glass," "borrowed dawn," "living vectors," "luminous net"). In peak beats (dust flare, eel surge, final choice) density obscures causal clarity—what exactly happens when she "lets the glow fade"? Paraphrase loop: lines 24–26 restate "patterns in eels, stones, light, dust, aurora" without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in the final third. Figurative muddle and scaffold artifacts together warrant −1.2, placing mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("lightning carving white scars," "storm-kissed wonder," "cloak sewn from lightning and quiet"), but several beats stack metaphors without advancing causality: paragraphs on scars, maps, silence, and storms loop semantically. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He placed… He recalled… He opened… He folded… He breathed… He understood… He placed… He thought… He knew…" The repeated "He [verb]" stems across the final third create a drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops (e.g., "cartography of scars" rephrased multiple times without added pressure) lower density. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for template cadence + loops touching the closure third, and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the piece: "turning questions into destinations" and variations echo across five separate beats without added pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates sentence openings in the duel sequence: "Rhen's mind raced," "Rhen glanced," "Rhen pressed forward," "Rhen lowered," "Rhen walked away." Stock metaphor strings appear unchallenged: "dance of intellect and steel," "words sharp as a rapier," "silent applause of the brook." Filter-verb stacks cluster in the opening third ("believed," "noted," "studied"). The final paragraph loops synonym variants of the core thesis across four sentences, dulling closure momentum. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallow 9+ globally per the stated rule.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "blooming resistance" appears four times; "luminous fracture" twice; "rusted library under stars" or close variants seven times without reweighting. Template cadence in the opening four paragraphs: "He was... He molts... A dented coffee tin... This month he was..." Stock metaphors: "wildflowers cracking pavement," "garden of stories," "cathedral." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 18: "believed," "taught," "taught" across three lines. The mosaic structure creates 22 micro-paragraphs, many of which paraphrase (e.g., paragraphs 12 and 23 both describe the coffee tin's false bottom). Information density is low: paragraphs 22 and 23 recapitulate backstory without altering present stakes. These artifacts touch the closure third (final five paragraphs repeat "blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," "rusted"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (ghost of a waltz, cloud stuff, silver threads). Line-level clarity holds across spatial moves. Paraphrase loops appear: "The horizon invited night" recurs three times with minimal variation; "flickering compasses" and "steely longing" are repeated formula rather than evolved motif. Template cadence in the ending third ("He played until…," "He closed…," "He smiled…," "He would play again…") stacks identical stems without taught pattern, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is high but scaffold phrases ("as if," "a reminder that") pad several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no major loops or paraphrase cycles appear. However, figurative language saturates several high-pressure beats without always clarifying: "light through cracked glass," "language of sediment and time," "mycelium connecting every mind," "refracting into questions without answers"—these stack metaphors in quick succession, occasionally blurring concrete action. The phrase "luminous doubt" recurs without evolution. Minor template cadence in the late sequence: "He would spend… The seed was gone… And somewhere… Kael knew…" uses similar stems across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative density is high throughout ("unspun silk," "ghost ship's compass," "spectral patterns," "lunar logic," "tide water") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff escalation at closure—the metaphoric register remains constant rather than modulating with pressure. "Rhythmically placid" appears three times with identical phrasing (template cadence). Paraphrase loop: "The tides of remembrance would continue...but now they would nourish instead of erode" restates the growth-around-wound concept without new pressure. These artifacts cluster but don't obscure the closure image, triggering −0.8 in this category per the patterned-artifact pack baseline.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: images are sharp, verbs are mostly precise, and most sentences do multiple jobs (character, setting, and theme at once). There is some mild repetition and abstraction in the back half (“kindled humility,” “humble truth,” “needless drama”), and a few phrases verge on purple but do not obscure clarity. Momentum is remarkably well maintained for a meditative piece, with almost no scaffolding or synonym churn. The final image of the decaying dish and her going inside “to begin again” lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some strong images (frost glittering like shattered glass, molten glass as a river of light). There is mild repetition and scaffold (“a luminous glass artist,” “quiet promise,” “beacon,” “resonance”) and a tendency to state what the images already imply, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it risks purple in places without fully tipping over. Tighter trimming of near-duplicate sentiments and a bit more concrete embodiment of pain and effort would raise the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-by-line, the prose is clean, readable, and mostly economical; sentences typically advance both atmosphere and emotional meaning. Figurative language is present but not so dense it becomes purple or muddled, and key images (frost “painting” the panes, colors rippling through glass) are clear and memorable. There is some conceptual repetition around silence/canvas/marvels and the fork triad, but it generally functions as motif rather than deadweight. Further tightening of a few abstract explanatory lines could heighten impact, but there are no serious artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level writing is dense but largely precise; most sentences carry multiple loads (world-building, emotion, and theme) without feeling redundant. Metaphors are coherent and thematically linked to water, silt, light, and architecture, avoiding mixed or strained images. There’s minimal scaffold or paraphrase looping; progression from line to line usually adds new nuance rather than rephrasing. The only reason this doesn’t reach the absolute top band is that the near-continuous figurative richness occasionally risks saturation, where a touch more plainness might increase contrast and punch.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with some effective images (the bell’s patina as “a map of memories,” voices like “leaves”). There is mild repetition of phrases and concepts (e.g., “gently persistent,” bell-as-hope) and occasional thematic overstatement that could be tightened for greater impact. Figurative language is generally controlled and not overwrought, though the density of abstractions in later paragraphs slightly dulls momentum. Overall, line-level craft is solid but not yet striking or maximally economical.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and vivid, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“fog swirling like a lucid dream,” “camera obscura captured the luminous truth within shadows”). However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and several sentences paraphrase or restate prior insights (multiple formulations of unused love being preserved/released, repeated fog-lifting/clarity images), creating a mild sense of redundancy. The high density of similar metaphors edges toward purple in places, softening impact rather than sharpening it. Rhythm and grammar are solid, but a tighter, more selective line-level approach would better serve an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with meaning, and generally do multiple jobs at once (worldbuilding, theme, and plot). Figurative language is lush (“ridged like bark, porous as loam, fibrous as mycelium”) but mostly coherent and on-theme rather than gratuitous. A few moments verge on metaphor-stacking and abstraction, which can slightly blur emotional immediacy, yet they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. There’s little noticeable scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm supports the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with clear sequencing of action and minimal scaffolding. Many sentences do double duty, advancing both plot and mood, and the rhythm varies enough to avoid mechanical monotony. There is some tendency toward stacked metaphors and repeated “his X a Y” constructions that edge into mild purple prose without fully obscuring clarity. Overall momentum holds, but a few lines feel like interchangeable lyric filler rather than indispensable strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; almost every sentence carries atmosphere, world-building, and thematic weight simultaneously. Metaphors are generally coherent and fresh (“wind through a ribcage,” “glass screaming underwater”), and the rhythm reads well aloud. There is some risk of density/purple prose, with metaphor stacking and frequent abstractions around silence and absence, but clarity survives and the closure image is not obscured. Minor pruning of repeated conceptual phrasing could further sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and sonorous, with few grammatical missteps and a clear sensory palette. That said, figurative language is very dense (“golden rays bled,” “tiles pulsing with a hidden heartbeat,” “a silver thread weaving through the painted night”), with many lines doing similar atmospheric work without adding new information. Key phrases and constructions recur (“luminous disbelief,” “illuminated moments,” golden/moonlight) to the point of mild redundancy. The overall effect is attractive but verging on purple, and momentum occasionally softens under the weight of ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density—many lines pull double duty thematically and atmospherically, such as “fire was the only thing that understood frost.” Metaphor is generally controlled and coherent (thaw, current, glass, questions), and there are few if any genuine clunkers or contradictions. That said, figurative language is quite dense throughout, occasionally flirting with purple and leaving little breathing space, especially in the middle. Trimming a handful of abstractions and slightly redundant intensifiers would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally clear and efficient, with most sentences advancing plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously (e.g., the AI’s “cameras glowing red like predatory eyes”). There are a few purple or slogan-like phrases—“canvas of trembling stars,” “circuits of strength,” “map of hope”—and some mild redundancy in reiterating her thematic motivation. Still, syntax is controlled, grammar is clean, and there are no loops or artifacts that obscure cause and effect. The final image is legible and emotionally coherent despite a slightly sentimental overfinish.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level writing is generally clean, grammatical, and image-rich, with some lovely phrases (gold leaf falling “like autumn dust,” silence “pressed like amber”). Yet the density of similar metaphors and repeated constructions (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “constellation of quiet”) edges toward redundancy rather than escalation. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea of silence-as-story or map without adding new pressure or detail. Rhythm can feel monotonous due to repeated structural patterns and limited syntactic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with strong imagery and efficient progression; most sentences do double duty for mood and meaning. There is some lexical repetition (“amalgamate/amalgamating/amalgamation,” “loops,” “resonance”) and a mild tendency toward conceptual abstraction that can blunt immediacy. Figurative language is usually apt but occasionally stacks (“cascade of recursive moments,” “architecture of thought,” “larger symphony”) in ways that feel slightly repetitive. Nothing seriously obscures clarity or closure, but a pass for tightening and trimming abstraction would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean, generally concise, and easy to follow, with a gentle rhythm that suits the quiet tone. There is some repetition and scaffold (“resonant hush,” multiple declarations about transparency and trust) that could be pared to increase density. Figurative language is mostly restrained and coherent; nothing crucial is obscured by purple phrasing. Line-level craft is solid but somewhat safe and occasionally redundant, which holds it below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some genuinely striking images (cracked marbles like constellations, fireflies echoing their glint). At the same time, conceptual phrases recur without fresh work—“mended deception,” “blooming withering,” “gardens know their gardeners,” and the “true measure of luck” are repeated rather than deepened. Several late paragraphs paraphrase the same idea (rituals of commemoration, gardens drawing strength from intention) in slightly different words, which softens momentum and impact. Figurative language rarely becomes incoherent, but the density of thematic restatement flattens the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing both atmosphere and concept (“timelines spreading sideways like frost on glass” is emblematic). There is some density of figurative language that flirts with purple, but the metaphors remain coherent and aligned with the story’s core imagery of frost, light, and magnetism. Redundancy is minimal and the prose generally maintains momentum despite its lyricism. A touch more spareness at peak-pressure moments could sharpen impact, but current execution is already above most submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm, efficient sentences, and vivid images that generally do more than one job (e.g., water damage as both physical fact and code). Repetition of key phrases and structures feels mostly intentional and pattern-driven rather than like scaffold. There are no significant clarity issues or tangled metaphors, and the final cadence lands cleanly. The density of figurative language approaches saturation in places; a few plainer lines to vary texture would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing contains many strong images (“aurora bleed across the peaks,” “swaying certainties”) and generally clean syntax, with few outright errors. Yet the prose is padded by paraphrase loops and thematic restatements, especially in the final third, where multiple sentences rephrase the same realization about weight and forgiveness. Some metaphors and phrases (auroral sorrow, weight of truth) are reused without deepening, shading into mild purple prose. Tighter cutting and more varied, precise imagery in the climax paragraphs would materially increase momentum and punch.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length, metaphor often does double duty, and momentum is maintained despite a fairly lush style. Some paraphrase and concept repetition (“weight,” “beads,” “swallowed truths,” “ghost shift”) skate close to looped emphasis, though they mostly feel like deliberate motif rather than padding. A few metaphors (“faces pressed into the weave of eternity”) flirt with purple, but they remain coherent within the textile-mill imagery and do not obscure action. Tightening 5–10% of the more declarative or redundant lines would bring the prose to an elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and world (“silence pooled like water,” “paper thin as memory”). There is some repetition and near-looping of phrases and concepts (peace crumbling, seasons drifting, regenerative silence) that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; it skirts purple without sliding into confusion. Line-level momentum is modest due to the lyric mode, but clarity and grammar remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, with high information density and very little redundancy. Figurative language is generally apt and not overstacked, and key metaphors (dreaming roots, ordinary magic, the key in the lock) are coherent and payoff-bearing. There are a few slightly expository or abstract lines in the final third (“Her motivation had always been to nurture lifelong wonder…”) that feel less vivid than the surrounding prose, but they don’t significantly harm momentum or clarity. Overall, this is near-publishable at an elite level on the sentence scale.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density; most sentences do double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors are frequent but largely apt (“pages charred at the edges like moth wings,” “like a battery holds charge”) and not self-contradictory. There is some near-purple density and conceptual restatement (e.g., reiterating the walls’ listening function) that slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure meaning or closure. Line-level craft is publication-ready with only minor tightening needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and generally do multiple jobs (setting, theme, and character in the same line). Figurative language is frequent but mostly sharp and non-redundant; it rarely muddies sense or stalls momentum. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase-looping, and transitions between beats are clean. A few abstractions (“transposed her life into a new key”) flirt with being on-the-nose, but they’re anchored by concrete images enough that they don’t materially harm the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is dense yet controlled, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character in one move (“decorating the air with unasked questions”). Metaphors (silence as pigment, indigo as absence, certainty as armor) are sustained and coherent rather than haphazard. There is some risk of overload, but repetition tends to be structural (looping, layering) rather than accidental, and I see no serious synonym loops or scaffolding that stall momentum. The prose stops short of purple while maintaining a high level of musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is high: strong verbs, precise images, and economical yet lush description that usually does more than one job. The prose supports momentum rather than stalling it, and figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s motifs (ice, mirrors, spirals, sound). There is some paraphrastic repetition and near-duplicate phrases (“mirrored horizon…upturned hush…quiet triumph”) that slightly dilute impact, especially near the end. Still, there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors, and the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient, with many lines doing double duty for image and concept ("runes bleeding light that painted equations of her existence"). Repetition of key motifs is patterned and purposeful, though occasionally the stack of abstractions ("labyrinth of self," "periodic eternity," "infinite recursion") risks feeling slightly overdetermined. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no significant clarity failures or mixed metaphors undermining closure. Overall line craft is strong and polished, if a touch uniformly grand in register.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with images doing emotional and thematic work simultaneously. A few phrases lean toward purple or sentimental abstraction (“each drop a note she could finally feel,” “carved a path through her numbness”), creating a slight sense of overstatement. Repetition of key metaphors is mostly purposeful, though it edges close to redundancy in the final third. Still, momentum is maintained and there are no serious clarity or scaffold issues dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with strong sensory images (“tiles were slick with evening dew,” “stone benches worn smooth by time”). Many sentences do double duty—advancing plot while deepening atmosphere or character. There is some paraphrase-like repetition and abstract phrasing (“nurtured his integrity,” “layered tranquility of his purpose”) that could be tightened for greater impact. Still, momentum is largely maintained, and figurative language remains coherent rather than overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs, marrying sensory detail with emotional state, and the prose remains clear despite its density. Figurative language is frequent but generally disciplined and thematically aligned (lanterns, breathing, archives, concentration), and syntax varies enough to avoid a mechanical cadence. There is some purple edging and conceptual redundancy—several sentences reframe the same insight about scent, grief, and memory—which slightly slows momentum and flirts with overwriting. Nonetheless, closure remains sharp and legible, and no figurative muddle obscures key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and imagistic, with several strong lines linking physical detail to concept (“The texture of time, he now knew, was not smooth but braided, each fray a moment of decision”). However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and constructions, and figurative language borders on purple in places without always adding new insight. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about time, pattern, and layers, slightly dragging momentum. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the final image lands intact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing is generally clear and musical, with effective images like “a duet of destruction and creation” and the hulls humming with the violin’s vibrations. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing—“the power of listening and telling,” “magnificent simplicity”—that feel more like thematic labels than vivid particulars, slightly dulling momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent, not devolving into purple density or mixed metaphors. Overall, the prose is strong and publishable with tightening, rather than already razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: good rhythm, clear syntax, and images that are concrete and memorable without frequent confusion. The piece is dense with figurative language and motif repetition, which mostly works but occasionally edges toward redundancy (“My motivation, always, was to fuse insight with empathy” and its variants). Some paraphrase-like restatements in the latter half slow momentum and mildly flatten the closure beat. Trimming a few near-duplicates would sharpen an already polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are mostly clear and grammatically sound, with a smooth if somewhat uniform rhythm. The prose tends toward repetition and mild overwriting—conceptual loops about compassion, quiet heroes, and cycles recur without adding new nuance. Important beats (the investigation, organizing the ceremony) are compressed into expository summary where scene would provide sharper, more efficient impact. While nothing is egregiously clumsy, the line-level work lacks the precision, compression, and surprise expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is rich and efficient; most sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and character—all at once. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (glass, roots, webs, song), and there are few if any true loops or scaffolding sentences. In places, the prose flirts with purple, leaning on abstract formulations (“the silence between notes held generations of names”) that risk softening impact. Overall, though, momentum is preserved and the final images are clear and strong.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: high information density, clean syntax, and vivid metaphor without frequent muddle or contradiction. Recurrent images (breath, canals, echoes, infinity) are reused purposefully rather than as ornament, and there are no obvious scaffold sentences or synonym loops. Some phrases verge on purple or packed—“time shattered into a thousand refracted moments”—but they remain coherent and aligned with the story’s logic. The prose sustains momentum despite its lushness, though a hair more variation in sentence texture around the climax could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, syntactically varied, and rich with sensory imagery, and most sentences do more than one job. However, figurative density is very high—nearly every line carries metaphor or abstraction—so the texture occasionally veers toward purple, with some conceptual repetition (“mathematics of emotion,” “ambiguous loss,” “buried optimism”) that doesn’t always add new pressure. Despite this, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the closure image reads cleanly. Slimming a few redundant formulations would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, carry multiple functions (setting, character, mood), and generally avoid redundancy. The figurative motif of the building as a body (“bones,” “pulse,” “arteries”) is coherent rather than muddled, and the prose sustains a rich but legible lyricism. There are occasional near-purple moments (“exhaled shadows like a lung filling with dusk”) yet they maintain internal logic and don’t stall momentum. A slightly leaner middle—paring a few repeated sensory cues—would tighten propulsion further.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, mostly concise, and maintains momentum despite a reflective mode; sentences do multiple jobs, advancing both scene and theme. Imagery around plants and weather is consistent and not excessively purple, and there are few, if any, clarity issues. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“circuitously sincere,” explicit “lesson” language) that reads a bit like scaffold or paraphrase at a high level. Overall, the line work is strong but not yet razor-honed enough—too often it tells what the image already implies.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are musical, images are concrete, and most lines do more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion, etc.). There is some paraphrase and concept repetition (“thresh meaning,” “haggard awe,” “convergence”) that could be tightened, and a few abstractions verge on purple or expository (“weight of meaning threshed from the chaff of war”). Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and closure is clear and well-framed. Overall, this is publishable prose with minor overwriting that could be pared back.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished, with strong images and generally efficient sentences that both advance the scene and build atmosphere. There is some repetition of concepts and phrasing (e.g., “overlapping shadows,” “bright darkness,” “steadily unpredictable”) that edges toward redundancy rather than deepening each time. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and not so dense as to obscure sense or momentum. Tightening a few paraphrased ideas and slightly varying some repeated constructions would sharpen the line-level further.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with strong imagery and efficient sentences that usually carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, theme, and mood together). There is some repetition at the end around silence/absence/meaning and a few sentences verge on purple or didactic, but they don’t obscure sense or closure. Rhythm is varied enough to keep momentum in a largely reflective piece. Overall line-level craft is publication-ready with only light tightening needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, with high information density and many images doing double duty for setting and theme (e.g., the door smelling of “ticket stubs and promises”). The prose occasionally approaches overload with stacked metaphors, yet most remain coherent and aligned, avoiding serious figurative muddle. There is minimal redundancy or scaffold, and syntax varies enough to prevent drumbeat patterns. A slight trimming of modifiers in a few sentences would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some pleasing images (whale calls vibrating through stone, memories transcribed into murals). However, key phrases and concepts (“unheard symphony,” “sculpted space for reflection,” “entangled memories”) are repeated often enough to feel slightly formulaic. There is some sentimentality and abstract language where sharper, more concrete detail could carry the emotion more powerfully. Momentum is adequate for a lyric piece, but occasional redundancy and summary soften the line-level charge.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme, and there are no major clarity failures or syntactic stumbles. However, figurative language and abstractions are stacked in a high percentage of lines (“spatial mutiny,” “architecture of creation beginning to question its own design,” etc.), which risks purple density and slight conceptual repetition. Momentum survives, but a few moments feel more like concept-display than pressure-building. Tightening or varying texture in peak beats would lift this into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally sharp, dense, and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Extended metaphors around embalming, mathematics, and commerce are consistent rather than muddled, and there’s little true scaffolding or redundancy. That said, figurative language is nearly constant, pushing toward purple in places and occasionally stating theme rather than letting images do the work. Rhythm and clarity hold throughout, so the lushness reads more as mild excess than as an obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are clear, sentences are mostly lean, and many lines pull double duty for atmosphere and theme. There is some paraphrase and structural repetition (“Each map became…”, “Each hue represented…”, “Each page a world”) that adds a faint sense of looping. Figurative density occasionally brushes purple but remains internally coherent and seldom obscures sense. Tighter pruning of near-duplicate phrases and a bit more rhythmic variation would bring it closer to elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level work is strong: metaphors are generally precise (salt on dried skin, filing cabinets slamming on a living name) and multitask for atmosphere and theme. Syntax and sentence length vary enough to keep the rhythm from becoming sing-song, even with repeated patterns like “He [verbs], [verbs], [verbs].” There is some density of figurative language, but it feels patterned and intentional rather than purple or redundant, and the closure image is clear rather than muddled. I see no substantive scaffold, loops, or copy-level errors that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: images are vivid, sentences carry multiple functions, and there is good rhythmic variation. Some conceptual and phrasing repetition (“inside the whisper of closing pages,” multiple explicit restatements of the riddle’s nature) edges toward redundancy but usually feels pattern-driven rather than sloppy. Figurative language is dense yet mostly coherent; it rarely collapses into muddle or cliché. The main limitation is a tendency toward over-articulated abstraction in places where a more concrete beat could have amplified impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence contributes atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is frequent but generally controlled and coherent, with only a few spots approaching mild purple. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and the final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs. Minor repetition in sentence openings (“She…”) and some abstract emotional labels are the main line-level weaknesses.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and often evocative, with several effective images (the violet flare, petals “like a final sigh,” the trembling grain). Information density is decent: most sentences carry atmosphere and motion together. There is some paraphrase and motif repetition that reads more like mild padding than pattern-building (multiple nearly identical “dawning hush” and “purposefully curious” moments). Figurative language veers close to purple in places but rarely obscures sense or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is strong and often beautiful, with high information density—many sentences advance character, setting, and theme simultaneously (e.g., the mercury basin “bending [light] into patterns her trained mind could translate into circuitry”). Syntax and paragraphing provide a steady, readable rhythm, and there are no major clarity issues or loops. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent; only a few phrases (“magnetic calm,” “each connection a prayer”) verge on familiar lyricism without undermining sense. Tightening a handful of metaphors and trimming one or two near-redundant lines could raise the polish further.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is controlled, rhythmic, and dense with meaningful imagery; many sentences do double duty for setting, theme, and character. Repetitions like “To find where the rivers begin…” and the falcon motif build a deliberate incantatory pattern rather than feeling like accidental loops. The main drag is a touch of over-insistence in the final third, where several sentences restate the same conceptual transformation in slightly different language, which slightly blunts the sharpness of the closing image. Still, clarity is never compromised, and there is little in the way of true scaffolding or muddled metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line by line, the prose is tight and deliberate; most sentences accomplish multiple tasks (world-building, mood, and concept) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent and seldom mixed or confusing; phrases like “Moss grew in its cracks like old blood” sharpen rather than blur. There are a few near-repetitions in concept (“infinitely patient” echoed, breath/hush motifs) but they function as motifs more than scaffolding. Overall momentum is well sustained for lyric fiction, with no major loops or purple excess that obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level work is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and images that usually pull double duty (e.g., silence as both physical pressure and emotional aftershock). Phrases like “silence that tasted like salt and starlight” and “lonesome splendor” are lush yet legible, and repetition of key motifs feels intentional rather than looped. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances mood, plot, or theme. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in the final third prevents this from reaching the very top band but doesn’t blur causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images (“the tide whispered against the reef,” “the lattice…sustaining the impossibility of truth within a lie”) and a consistent rhythmic cadence. However, key motifs (“copperlight repose,” “chasing hush,” “sustaining impossibilities”) are reiterated so often that they verge on incantatory redundancy rather than fresh development. Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally blurring physical action in favor of abstraction. Despite this, clarity of sequence is maintained and there are few outright muddled or clumsy lines.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and evocative, with strong images like the ghost’s dress “woven from the mist itself” and tendrils “like threads of starlight.” Sentences mostly do multiple jobs—advancing action while deepening mood—and the read-aloud rhythm is smooth. There is some purple density and repetition of similar atmospheric notes (endless night, hush, frost, winter-cracked fields) that occasionally feels like ornament more than pressure. Still, clarity is never compromised, and there are no noticeable loops or structural artifacts dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with strong imagery and few outright clumsy lines. Some constructions veer into purple or abstract (“weaving ruin into reverence,” “sun rose like a pale orchid”), and key motifs are repeated in near-identical formulations that don’t always add new nuance. Still, clarity is maintained and most sentences pull their weight. Tighter trimming of conceptual redundancy and a bit more variety in figurative strategy would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for mood and theme. Figurative language (“the air smelled of moss and memory,” “each bone a bookmark”) is mostly precise and anchored, with little true purple prose. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “quiet,” “hope,” and restated realizations that could be trimmed for maximum sharpness, but they don’t materially dull the closure image. The piece reads as already well-edited by typical standards, if not yet razor-honed to minimalist perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for setting, theme, and character. Imagery is consistently strong and mostly coherent (e.g., “her eyes the color of old neon,” “voice crackling like a vinyl recording”), with only minor risks of purple prose that don’t derail clarity. There is some repetition of key motifs (“margins,” nostalgia vs. digital future), but it feels intentional rather than looped scaffolding. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain momentum in a reflective, low-action piece.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished: sentences are clear, varied, and generally do more than one job (world, mood, and character together). A few phrases (“adjacent possibilities,” repeated “echoed silence”) veer abstract or slightly repetitive, but not enough to drag momentum or clarity. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically of a piece—thread, stars, flame, silence—and doesn’t collapse into mixed metaphors. The closing cadence is strong and clean, with no obvious scaffolding or technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and high-density: most sentences carry image, emotion, and worldbuilding simultaneously without slack. Figurative language is frequent but largely controlled and thematically coherent around water, song, storms, and breath; it seldom muddies meaning. Syntax and paragraphing vary enough to maintain momentum and highlight turns (activation of shard, appearance of sister’s face, spoken apology). A slight risk of purple at times, but it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line by line, the prose is precise, information-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically braided (coral/brain, roots/questions, archipelagos), avoiding mixed metaphors or decorative excess that would blur sense. The rhythm on the page feels intentional, with varied sentence lengths and paragraph cuts that support the accumulating tension. A few phrases approach abstraction (“the dark that tasted like cordite and salt,” “mist thickens into something like forgiveness”) but remain grounded enough not to undercut clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is fluent and mostly tight, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character, e.g., “each step a negotiation with the ghost of a path.” Some repetition of concepts (joy, fog/light contrast, “pensive mirth”) and slightly purple turns do creep in, but they don’t seriously stall momentum. Syntax is varied and clear, with no major scaffolding or obvious loops, and action ordering is easy to follow. A touch more cutting of redundant or near-platitudinous phrases would sharpen an already-strong surface.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme. Figurative language is mostly coherent and on-point, and the piece avoids clumsy scaffolding or obvious loops at the level of pure redundancy. However, motif phrases and core ideas are restated in ways that start to feel repetitive rather than progressively deepening (“nested awakenings,” “pause between question and reply,” certainty vs. curiosity). A bit more pruning and variation around these key terms would sharpen momentum and keep the lyricism from bordering on self-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and most do double-duty, advancing both world and character (e.g., the description of the seed as “thrum[ming] with encoded potential” fuses object, plot, and theme). Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with one governing metaphor (language/nature vs surveillance) rather than scattered ornament. There is minimal redundancy and no major syntactic or logical stumbles; the prose carries strong momentum into and through the auditors’ scene. The density of imagery occasionally edges toward purple, but it does not materially obscure cause/effect or blur the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong, rhythmic, and image-rich; many lines efficiently carry setting, mood, and theme at once. However, there is noticeable repetition of certain formulations (“half-sung lullabies,” “off-key wind,” “across centuries of longing”) without fresh inflection, and the density of figurative language approaches purple in places. Despite this, clarity remains high and there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors. Tightening redundancy and varying image vehicles would sharpen momentum without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with many striking images and a clear ear for rhythm. That said, the density of figurative language and recurring high-register abstractions (“deserted marvels,” “extinct feelings”) sometimes tip toward purple, and several adjacent sentences restate nearly the same idea about regret and preservation. The prose maintains clarity and momentum despite this, and the final paragraphs still land cleanly. Tightening loops and varying sentence structure more would bring it closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is smooth, mostly free of redundancy, and dense with meaningful information—many sentences carry worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language (“quicksilver ink that shimmered with trapped starlight harvested from dying languages,” “cathedral halls of memory”) is mostly precise and on-theme rather than purple for its own sake. There are a few abstract or slightly repetitive phrases (“carefully reckless,” “symponies of truth” reiterated often, the closing moral sentence) that could be tightened to heighten impact. Overall momentum holds well, but a touch of trimming in the explanatory and reflective sentences could make the line-level craft feel even more elite.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, with many doing double duty for atmosphere and character. A few phrases and metaphors recur a touch too insistently (heart, breath, encrypted compassion, dappled resolve), nudging the prose toward mild purple in places. The ending leans on thematic abstraction rather than the sharpest possible concrete image, slightly dulling the closure beat. Still, there are no real loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles that impede comprehension or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensory, and concise enough, with few if any grammatical slips. Many lines work double-duty for image and theme, leveraging concrete nouns and clean verbs. However, figurative density and repeated constructions (especially involving dust motes, echoes, and trails) occasionally tip toward redundancy without adding new pressure or nuance. The prose remains readable and often beautiful, but a light pruning would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with vivid phrases and a coherent sonic palette. There is noticeable repetition in structure and concepts (distances, thresholds, hush) that sometimes slides into paraphrase rather than fresh progression. A few lines verge on purple or explanatory, undercutting the more powerful images. Still, the line-level craft is competent and occasionally striking, just short of the tightest, high-density literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are rhythmic, vivid, and information-dense, often carrying worldbuilding, mood, and character simultaneously. The prose maintains momentum despite its lyricism, and the closing paragraphs land with clarity. However, figurative language is very dense—almost every line reaches for an image—so a few metaphors (“fossil-memory,” “shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”) risk feeling stacked and slightly purple rather than sharpening the moment. Trimming or varying the intensity in a few places would heighten impact and qualify it for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do more than one job, combining worldbuilding, mood, and forward motion. Figurative language is frequent but usually precise and coherent with the story’s imagery system (foam, glass, light, crystal), and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A few phrases edge toward purple or redundant (“her heart light with this melancholy joy” after “cheerful gloom”), and key insights are occasionally told rather than dramatized, slightly flattening momentum. Still, clarity, cadence, and information density are strong enough for competitive publication.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is tightly controlled, with high information density and very few wasted sentences; description, causality, and theme often share the same line. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous sentences and sharper beats (“The boy found the quarter, as intended.”), maintaining momentum. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful, rarely tipping into muddle or purple excess. Minor potential trims exist in some near-synonymous rephrasings of Ezra’s system, but they don’t materially drag the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with few outright clunkers, and it maintains clarity despite its lyric density. However, key phrases and structures recur (“twilight garden under stars,” “cosmic verse on mortal skin,” nostalgia ban) in ways that sometimes feel like paraphrase-loops rather than deliberate refrains. Figurative language occasionally trends toward purple or generic cosmic grandeur without adding new information. The line-level craft is solid and publishable with edits, but not as lean or surprising as the very best.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and image-rich, with strong metaphorical cohesion around glass, light, and water. Sentences are generally well-shaped and rhythmically varied, and there are few outright confusions. However, there is noticeable repetition of key phrases and concepts and occasional purple abstraction that could be tightened without loss. Some adjacent lines restate similar insights in slightly different language, which slightly blunts momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally beautiful, dense, and purposeful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “a pack frame for the long carry of memory”). Rhythm varies well and there is little scaffolding or synonym-churn; almost every line advances character, atmosphere, or concept. There is some repetition of metaphoric frames (language, constellations, enlightenment) that borders on over-insistence but does not seriously muddy clarity or momentum. Overall, line-level craft is strong enough for high-tier venues, albeit just shy of the rarefied top band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: images are sharp (“hope density across seventeen concurrent realities”) and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, theme, atmosphere) without bloat. There is some repetition of phrasing (“lucidly watchful,” “creating patterns with decorations”) and a few moments of conceptual stacking that edge toward purple, but they don’t obscure sense or slow momentum markedly. Figurative language is mostly coherent and grounded in the marine/quantum lexicon the story has taught. The closing movements maintain clarity while sustaining a high level of lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, with vivid images like the negative’s emulsion “cracked like dried riverbed.” There is some redundancy and phrase recycling, particularly around key motifs and the “sensitively perceptive” tag, creating a mild sense of scaffolding. A few abstractions and thesis-like sentences in the final section slightly slow momentum and reduce the sharpness of the closing image. These are notable but not structural issues in otherwise solid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely clean, musical, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding. However, there are noticeable paraphrase loops and near-duplicate lines (“The mirrors slowly returned to their ordinary selves, yet each now held a faint glimmer of the worlds they had shown” appears essentially twice), which dull momentum. Figurative language stays within one register and rarely becomes incoherent, but a few repeated constructions and stock-ish modifiers (“perceptively calm,” “grace”) feel like scaffolding rather than necessity. The line-level craft is strong but could be tightened to avoid redundancy and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is smooth, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied, with some strong images (“a city its sunrise,” “a forgotten promise”) and purposeful callbacks. There is some abstraction and repetition of similar phrases (“price of redemption,” “fragile,” “flawed beauty”) that nudge the prose toward theme-assertion rather than fresh sensory work, but it doesn’t seriously impede clarity or momentum. Most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding or loops. The final images land clearly, even if the diction leans familiar for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong—image-rich, rhythmically varied, and mostly efficient, with lines often doing double duty for mood and theme. A few instances tip toward purple or redundant (“fractured grace,” reiterated explanations of philanthropy vs harm), creating mild sense of over-insistence. Some middle and late paragraphs summarize institutional responses and village displacement rather than embodying them, which slightly flattens momentum. Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and the closing images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, concise, and high-density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing action, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously). Rhythm is well-managed; the piece avoids scaffold phrases and expository droning, and the climax reads clearly on the line level. There is some mild overwriting/abstraction—phrases like “bodily poetic nature” and repeated thematic labels slightly blunt the impact of otherwise sharp imagery. Even so, there are no serious artifacts or loops, and the closure image is clean and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent: high information density, vivid images, and minimal scaffolding; nearly every sentence works double duty for tone and meaning. The metaphoric texture (cordite, meteor hush, parabolic ceiling concentrating quiet) is mostly coherent and thematically apt. There is mild risk of saturation—figurative language is frequent enough that a few phrases (“meteor hush,” “counterfeit nothing less than reality itself”) flirt with purple or self-consciousness. Still, clarity and momentum hold, and no major artifacts blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is musical and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for setting, theme, and mood (“clouds pooled…like shy visitors,” “a syntax of absence speaking to ghosts”). Sentence rhythms vary and the story avoids obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops; it reads cleanly at the line level. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and some metaphors feel slightly overdetermined or layered (“each extinct pollinator erased seventeen plant memories”), creating a faint sense of stylistic saturation that a top-tier editor might want trimmed. Clarity remains intact, but occasional abstraction dilutes impact where a plainer line might cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, image-rich, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Motifs like the aurora, rope, ice, and sound do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme) without excessive explanation. There is some metaphor stacking and repeated phrasing that edges toward over-ornamentation, and a few abstractions (“snowmelt ardor,” “symphony of the lost”) are verging on high-flown. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are preserved, and no major loops or artifacts blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, theme, emotion) with good concision, and the rhythm varies naturally without obvious scaffolding or loops. Metaphors are generally coherent and on-theme (rearview driving, seed/shell, labyrinth of maybes), and the prose remains legible even at its densest. There is slight purple/abstraction creep in the closing lines (“becoming precisely nothing and playfully everything”) which feels more clever than necessary and softens impact. Still, momentum and clarity are well maintained for a lyric piece of this density.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Phrasing such as “every calculation a note, every verified sum a chord resolving in the gloaming” shows controlled metaphor rather than clutter, and syntax is clean and varied. There is mild repetition of key terms (“schematic,” “devotion,” “unknown”) and a consistently high metaphor density that occasionally verges on purple but remains intelligible. No major loops, mixed metaphors, or rhythm artifacts blunt the closure image of banners, vanished tile, and scribbled papyri.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished, with high information density and generally clean, striking metaphors; most sentences do more than one job. There is little scaffolding or redundancy, and the prose sustains momentum despite its lyricism. Some lines verge on conceptual overload (“carried in her cellular memory, encoded in the helices of her phantom DNA”) and explanatory phrasing near the end flattens the otherwise sharp imagery. Still, clarity is maintained and the closure image is not dulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level writing is strong: sentences are mostly clear, syntactically varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for image and theme. The figurative language is rich and mostly coherent, with relatively few mixed or confusing metaphors. That said, nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction, which edges toward purple and slightly dulls momentum and contrast, especially in the middle. Trimming a small fraction of metaphors would likely heighten impact without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, vivid but controlled imagery, and a good ratio of detail to movement with little fat or redundancy. The recurring motifs (eyes, leaves, ribbon, light) are handled cleanly without figurative overload or mixed metaphors. There are no noticeable loops or scaffolding artifacts, and the rhythm supports the scene’s gradual, contemplative build rather than dragging it. It’s polished, publishable prose, if slightly on the safe side stylistically.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and generally precise, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and interiority (“fruit that tasted like forgotten equations and shattered symmetries”). Imagery is sustained without collapsing into mixed metaphors, and momentum rarely stalls despite the philosophical bent. There is minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; each sentence tends to introduce a new facet or deepen the existing one. A few formulations veer close to purple or familiar (“terrible beauty,” “no matter the cost”), which slightly dulls the uniqueness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is polished, with few redundancies and a strong sense of rhythm; many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and concept. Extended metaphor around music and silence is consistent rather than muddled, and there’s minimal scaffold or synonym churn. In places the density of figurative language risks feeling slightly uniform, giving even high-pressure beats the same dreamy texture and dulling dynamic contrast. Nonetheless, clarity remains high and the final images (“golden chords,” “silent song”) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and information-dense, and most images do double duty for mood and theme. Some phrases (“unkindled solace,” “trapped freedom,” “color of hope”) veer toward familiar or abstract, and there is a light purple tinge, but clarity is preserved. There are no major loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles that impede momentum. Overall, prose supports rather than sabotages the closure, even if it’s not yet at a ruthlessly cut, top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense but mostly high-functioning: sentences often carry multiple jobs (world-building, theme, character) without redundancy, and there’s very little scaffolding or looped phrasing. Metaphors are generally apt and internally consistent (threads as timelines, wires as stories), and while the language occasionally brushes purple, it doesn’t impede understanding. Syntax varies enough to keep the ear engaged, and there are no evident grammatical or mechanical slips. The only restraint on a higher score is that figurative intensity is almost uniform—slightly more modulation and a few plainer beats under peak pressure would make the climactic turns hit even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, with strong information density and clear sequencing; most sentences carry both atmosphere and function. Recurring metaphorical language around sound, silence, and resonance is mostly coherent and purposeful. There is some paraphrase and phrase repetition (“gentle luminescence,” “hammered repose,” cycles of “bloom of hush would return”) that slightly blunts momentum and freshness. Still, the prose remains legible and rhythmic, without major artifacts that obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied in rhythm, rich in image, and usually do more than one job at once (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion). Recurrent motifs like “shard,” “humming,” and “light” build pattern without devolving into mere repetition, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. Figurative language is generally coherent and grounded; “a thistle blown by hope’s improbable breath” is a memorable, precise turn. The only restraint on a higher score is a mild overuse of explicit abstractions near the end, where the prose edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: almost every sentence carries multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but not incoherent; the storm/fog/memory metaphor system is consistent, and there are no mixed metaphors that blur sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The slight density of abstractions near the end (“spaces where experience dissolved into meaning”) is the only element that modestly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally precise and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and character. Some metaphor strings feel slightly over-saturated (“gravity of hopelessness thick as tar,” “bloom of violet flame,” “painted the walls with fleeting, brilliant patterns”), edging toward redundancy. There are a few paraphrase-like repetitions of the same idea (starless void, hope as spark/light) that could be trimmed for greater punch. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain intact, and the final images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are clear, often doing double duty for mood and theme, and the rhythms vary enough to avoid a mechanical beat. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (tides, foam, clocks as ripples, time’s “texture”). A few abstractions and repeated phrases (“texture of time,” “essence of transition periods”) slightly blunt momentum and edge toward didacticism. Still, there are no serious artifacts or loops, and the final lines land with a clean, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: vivid metaphors (“flavor like mint and distant thunder”), efficient sentences, and few if any technical errors. The prose maintains momentum despite being image-heavy, and most lines carry more than one job (worldbuilding plus emotion plus theme). However, key terms and ideas (“silence,” “hush,” “stretched/contracted”) recur in ways that occasionally feel redundant rather than deepening, and some late sentences paraphrase prior insights. A bit more pruning of near-duplicate phrases and explicit restatements of theme would sharpen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is musical and dense with imagery, yet generally clear and purposeful; sentences often multitask (worldbuilding, emotion, and theme in one move). Repetition around “silence,” “hush,” and similar motifs feels mostly patterned rather than accidental, supporting the accumulative design. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual redundancy in lines like “teach silence how to comfort” and “fluidly logical,” but rhythm and clarity hold, especially at closure. Line-level craft is strong enough for elite venues with only minor tightening needed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, image-rich, and rhythmically varied, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood (“trees of silver bark heavy with fruit that glowed like memory”). Information is clear and momentum rarely stalls despite the density of description. However, the near-constant figurative language and ornate modifiers verge on purple at times, and some repetition of phrases/functions could be tightened for even sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with a coherent figurative palette centered on ash, breath, and bridges. Some phrases and structures recur (“loaded emptiness,” reiterations of burning/building bridges and fading thresholds) in ways that edge toward redundancy rather than escalation. Metaphor density is high but mostly controlled; only occasionally does it risk feeling generic or explanatory instead of freshly embodied. A bit more pruning of repeated concepts and an extra layer of specificity in key beats would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are varied, images are concrete, and most lines do double duty (worldbuilding plus theme, or action plus atmosphere). Recurring metaphors of pressure, light, and seams are controlled rather than indulgent, and the prose reads cleanly aloud with few clunky constructions. There is some repetition of conceptual phrasing (“pressure,” “promise,” “seam”) that edges toward overinsistence, and a few abstract lines could be tightened, but they do not obstruct momentum or clarity. The final cadence lands elegantly with the silent texts and glowing farm.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally fluent and rhythmic, with some strong images (“dust motes dancing in the slanted light, each speck a truth”). However, repetition and paraphrase loops (“first yawn of evening,” “golden shadows,” “bridge of intuition,” multiple near-identical cadences) create a sense of sameness that dulls momentum. Abstractions and stacked modifiers occasionally lapse into purple territory, making some lines feel ornamental rather than necessary. Line-level craft is solid but not ruthlessly trimmed for density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are mostly clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, and the imagery is inventive rather than generic. There is some repetition and mild purple inflation—phrases like “shivering bliss” and “shape of possibility” recur, and nearly every beat is cast in heavily figurative language, which slightly blurs edge and momentum. Nonetheless, prose remains legible and propulsive enough that these flourishes do not significantly obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry character, setting, and theme simultaneously without obvious scaffolding or redundancy. Repetition of “dust” and related imagery reads as deliberate motif rather than accidental looping. The rhythm is generally strong and varied, and figurative language remains coherent and grounded. At times the accumulation of abstractions (“specialized grief,” “magnify small kindnesses”) leans a touch toward essayistic, but it doesn’t significantly blunt momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lean yet evocative; nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere without evident scaffolding or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective and generally strong—the star and water imagery coheres and pays off in the final paragraphs. Repeated phrases like “carefully resourceful” work as motif rather than redundancy, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. There are no muddled metaphors or line-level artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is often beautiful at the line level, but heavy repetition (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid,” “eerie nostalgia,” “prism atrium in mist”) and near-duplicate sentences create paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high with limited variation, edging into purple and flattening emphasis rather than sharpening it. Many sentences perform the same atmospheric work without adding new information or pressure, slowing momentum. The closure image remains clear, but the surrounding redundancy reduces its sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose often carries multiple jobs—worldbuilding, atmosphere, and action—in a single line, and there are many striking images (e.g., moonstone dust pulsing “like a heartbeat of the sky”). However, there is notable redundancy in phrasing (“emerges transformed always,” “mossy delight,” repeated hush/past/prophecy language) and some sentences paraphrase prior content without adding pressure or nuance. Figurative density remains just short of purple but risks monotony given the lack of contrasting plain beats. Overall clarity holds, yet tighter line edits could significantly sharpen momentum and reduce echo.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clean, and information-dense, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but thematically coherent (time, water, ash, gears) and rarely feels purple or mixed. Momentum is maintained even in more ornate sentences, and each line tends to do double duty in atmosphere and theme. A few phrases skate close to slogan (“certainty is just another kind of ash”), but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush but generally purposeful: images often do double duty for atmosphere and theme, and there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Sentence rhythms vary enough to keep momentum, and syntax stays clear even when metaphors stack. A few phrases flirt with purple density, yet they don’t materially obscure cause/effect or the closure image. Overall, line-level craft is polished and controlled, well within elite-market expectations for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense yet controlled: metaphors are vivid, generally coherent, and multitask for setting, emotion, and theme, and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundancy. Sentences carry momentum and vary in length, with especially strong line-level turns around key sounds and images (the harp’s notes, the laughter’s transformation). Figurative language is frequent, but it rarely feels purple or muddled; the few stacked comparisons are consistent rather than mixed. Line-level control stays strong through the climax and closing image, with no artifacts that blunt clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, grammatical, and often striking, with several sentences doing triple duty for image, emotion, and theme. However, there is notable conceptual and syntactic repetition—variants of “mathematics of mercy,” “data points,” “ratio,” and similar structures reappear without always adding new pressure. The figurative load runs high enough to feel purple in places, and some lines paraphrase prior insights rather than pushing forward. Momentum survives, but tighter cutting and more variation in texture would be required for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, worldbuilding) with few redundancies, and figurative language is generally coherent and well-matched to the world. Repeated motifs (“eternal instant,” “anchor of intuition,” “elusively tangible”) create pattern rather than obvious scaffold, though they verge on overuse in spots. There are no significant clarity issues, mixed metaphors, or syntactic monotony that impede momentum. Trimming a handful of near-duplicate insights about memory and light would likely tighten the piece to true top-tier concision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, image-rich, and generally free of scaffolding or loops; most sentences carry multiple weights (world, mood, character) efficiently. Metaphors like dust spirals as “choreography” and ghosts like “damaged film reels” are vivid and coherent with the visual/temporal motif. A few phrases verge on purple or essayistic (“architectural longing, a structural grief”; “silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty”), but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the piece propulsive and readable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and world-building (“the soft scrape of a million pages turning at once” is a standout). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and aligned with the book/library motif, maintaining clarity even in high-pressure beats. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition; each sentence tends to add new image or implication. The prose occasionally skirts purple, but it stops short of obscuring sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, information-dense, and multi-functional (worldbuilding plus mood plus interiority). The figurative language is rich and mostly coherent, with recurring metaphors (shard, mirror, storm) reinforcing each other rather than tangling. That said, density of imagery is high throughout, so a few abstractions (“sea of curated lies,” “burnished sorrow”) dull sharpness and edge toward ornamental. There are no true loops or scaffolding artifacts, but a touch more spareness in key beats would better match top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in length and rhythm, metaphors are generally apt, and almost every line carries dual duty for atmosphere and plot. The repeated rust imagery, musical language, and light motifs are coherent rather than redundant, and there is little to no scaffolding or synonym-churn. There is slight figurative density—occasional double metaphors like “malignant flower” atop rust—that nudges toward purple but doesn’t obscure sense or momentum. Information density and clarity remain high through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is polished: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, character, and theme at once) and avoid redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but generally clean and coherent, with standout lines like “water so still it seemed to be a hole in the world rather than part of it.” There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym-churn; progression is clear and momentum holds despite the lyric density. At times, the prose leans a fraction toward lush abstraction (“explanation’s architecture collapsed”), but it doesn’t significantly blur sense or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and fluid, images are clear, and most details do double duty for mood and meaning. The recurring metaphors (breath, wave, turbine blade, hum) are cohesive rather than mixed, and there’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping. A few abstractions and labeled insights in the closing paragraphs slightly blunt the impact where sharper, more concrete phrasing could heighten it. Still, the prose consistently advances character and atmosphere without notable clutter or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly economical, and frequently do double duty for image and theme. Some repetition of phrasing and concepts (“quiet,” “hush,” “silver whisper,” “umbral tenderness,” the postcards as maps) creates minor redundancy and occasional sense of over-insistence. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt, without mixed metaphors or syntactic confusion, though the density of poetic abstractions flirts with purple in places. Momentum remains adequate for a lyric piece, but a few lines restate prior insights instead of adding new pressure or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lean yet evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information; the recurring motifs (sand, shells, lagoon, glass) are economical and purposeful. Syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is mostly precise and non-intrusive, though occasionally a phrase like “mind bleeding into the memories of the dead” veers toward familiar metaphor. The summary mode in the midsection is efficient but slightly reduces immediacy compared to the strongest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmically varied, and free of major artifacts; images like “tide-worn shells” and “sky that had forgotten stars” are strong and clear. Information density is good: many lines do double duty for setting and theme. There is some conceptual and phrasal repetition (“reimagine an entire civilization” appears twice; “false comfort” recurs) and a few lines drift into expository telling that restates what the images have already conveyed. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and it does not obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, mostly efficient, and often do double duty by advancing image and theme simultaneously. Figurative language (e.g., “velvet shroud,” “quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet”) occasionally edges toward purple but remains coherent and doesn’t obscure sense or causality. There are no obvious paraphrase loops, template cadences, or confusing metaphors, and the prose maintains good momentum for a lyric piece. Minor trimming could heighten impact, but it already reads as well-edited.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft delivers many striking images (starlight feathering the hatchling, frost retreating like an exhale) and generally clean syntax and punctuation. Yet the prose leans toward purple and repetitive—key phrases and concepts are reiterated in near-identical form, and several sentences restate thematic points rather than advancing them. Information density is moderate rather than high; the latter third especially circles “borrowed time,” “wild serenity,” and “furious tranquility” without new facets. This lyrical looping softens momentum and slightly dulls the otherwise strong closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean yet evocative, with vivid phrases like “a prayer frozen mid-breath” and “the wind’s true voice” doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well, and most images are concrete and coherent with the world. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing in the closing third (repeating “the glue would cure by morning,” restating wisdom about listening and humility) that could be tightened. Overall, the prose is polished and publishable but not entirely free of small loops and slight purple edging.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, varied, and image-dense, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“a stillness that felt alive,” “a cocoon for transformation”). The repetition of key words creates purposeful pattern rather than mechanical looping, and there are few, if any, outright muddled metaphors. Nonetheless, the prose leans toward purple and abstract in places, stacking concepts (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance,” “spiritual quest”) where a more concrete beat might land harder. The lushness occasionally blurs sharpness of moment and momentum but does not seriously impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with some striking images (“paper thin as a whisper,” “glinting with fractured light”). At the same time, there is clear paraphrase looping and abstraction-churn: multiple sentences reiterate “weight of unspoken words,” “tangled covenant,” and “mute eloquence” without adding new information or pressure. This repetition flattens momentum and reduces the impact of otherwise strong moments like discovering the box and realizing the bees are dying. Tighter line-editing and more concrete, varied embodiment of similar ideas would lift the craft substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is tight and confident: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without redundancy, and metaphor density is high but generally coherent and purposeful. There are no significant loops or scaffolded explanations, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum while still allowing lyricism. A few metaphors skate close to abstract (“geometry had become negotiable”), but they remain intelligible and don’t blur causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with few grammatical or syntactic slips. Yet it leans toward purple and repetitive: key phrases and concepts (“woven dawns,” “burnished hush,” beauty in brokenness) are reiterated without always adding new nuance. Several sentences paraphrase prior insights in slightly different words, softening momentum and density. With sharper pruning and more varied figurative tactics, the line-level work could rise to a more exacting literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is controlled, image-dense, and purposeful; most sentences carry multiple functions (world-building, emotion, and theme) without feeling overburdened. Rhythm is well-modulated, with longer, incantatory lines for process and shorter, punchier turns for key shifts (“He was not dying—he'd been given a deadline.”). Recurring diction (“gently systematic,” pulses, humming) forms a deliberate pattern that supports the accumulative design rather than reading as accidental looping. I see minimal scaffolding or redundancy; line-level craft is already strong enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clear, mostly lean despite lyric coloration, and carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and character) with good density. Metaphors are controlled and coherent (amber as “captured sunlight,” “quiet forge of bronze resolve”) without sliding into muddle. There is minor repetition of key images and concepts that just skirts purple but generally reads as motif rather than padding. Momentum is gentle but steady, with no obvious scaffolding, loops, or mechanical cadences that damage the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: images are clear, metaphors coherent, and most sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding. Some phrases and constructions recur (“narrow vastness,” similar cadences around “the ghost of the reef”), bordering on mild over-ornamentation but not enough to obscure meaning or drag momentum. The rhythm reads well aloud, and there are no significant logical or grammatical snags. A light pass to prune repetition and a few explanatory sentences would push this closer to elite line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and information-dense; most sentences do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus emotion, or action plus theme) without obvious scaffolding. Rhythm varies nicely between compressed summary (the journey) and slowed, textured moments (the phonograph scene, the vault). Some metaphors push toward the purple but stay legible, and repetition motifs (“wild hush,” “tinted”) feel intentional rather than looped. There are no significant clarity issues or structural artifacts that impede momentum, though an even harsher trim of a few abstract restatements of the core insight would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and largely clean, with few syntactic or grammatical slips, and many sentences pull double duty for mood and information. However, there’s a persistent tendency toward purple, near-redundant phrasing—silence, echoes, void, glimmer, and starlight recur in similar constructions, slightly dulling impact. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase each other’s emotional content without adding new pressure or image. Rhythm is pleasant but somewhat uniform, lacking sharper cuts or compression where the narrative supposedly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craftsmanship is solid: sentences are mostly clean, images concrete, and the prose reads aloud well. There is some purple edging and paraphrase looping, particularly in the last third where the same emotional and thematic notes are restated with small variations. Phrases like “sacredly playful curiosity,” “embracing the unknown with open arms,” and “the wonder never does” veer toward cliché and dilute earlier fresher imagery. Trimming redundancy and resisting the urge to spell out the message would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often elegant, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme; there are few, if any, grammatical or clarity issues. Recurrent phrases and images (pawns, small gestures, luminous absence) mostly read as deliberate patterning rather than accidental loops, though the repetition edges toward over-insistence near the end. Figurative language is coherent and sustained; it rarely collapses into mixed metaphors. Some late lines paraphrase earlier ideas in slightly different words, which mildly flattens momentum but does not significantly obscure the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, varied, and information-dense, with images that do double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. The figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and thematically aligned (glass, stone, thunder, pattern), and there are few if any paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences. A handful of lines flirt with purple prose or near-redundancy—e.g., reiterating thunder and breath imagery without new pressure—but they do not seriously impede momentum or clarity. With slightly sharper pruning of repeated motifs and one or two abstractions, this would be elite-quality prose.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Refrains around threads, winnowing, and hush form a deliberate pattern rather than random repetition, giving the piece a cohesive texture. That said, a few lines lapse into abstract, explanatory phrasing and mixed-register lyricism, flirting with purple and slightly slowing momentum near the end. Overall, line-level craft is strong but not yet razor-honed for maximal precision and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with high information density and effective recurring motifs; sentences generally carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, mood, theme). There is some purple tendency—stacked metaphors and elevated abstractions in close proximity—and a few thematic restatements that could be trimmed without loss. Rhythm varies adequately, and grammar and sequencing remain clear; the closure image is not muddied. Line-level craft is strong but could be sharpened by cutting a few overt thesis-like sentences and tightening repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush, information-dense, and largely earns its metaphors; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, theme) without losing clarity. Rhythm varies well, and the line-level progression keeps momentum through a high-pressure scene, avoiding scaffolding or obvious synonym loops. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous, and occasional phrases (“dire enchantment,” “liquid sunrise,” “perfect sphere of transmuted hope”) flirt with purple excess and could be trimmed for even sharper impact. Despite that density, causality and closure remain fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and often graceful, with strong sensory images (the shaft of light “like a spear,” water “shimmered under a shaft of light”). At times it drifts into repetition and abstraction—“temporary eternity” and “hidden oasis” are reiterated, and several sentences paraphrase the same emotional state (promise remembered, weight of past lifting) without adding new texture. The “tapestry” and “pattern of hope” metaphors read slightly generic relative to the more concrete cave and sea imagery. Overall, solid line craft with some mild redundancy and familiar figurative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and most metaphors are coherent and reinforcing rather than redundant (cracked bell sky, glass as filter, scent as intention carrier). Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent around vibration and transmission, so it reads as voice rather than purple excess. There are no notable scaffold sentences or synonym loops, and momentum is maintained despite the reflective mode. A slight trimming of explicative lines about keeper lore could tighten further, but they don’t materially drag the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is dense but mostly economical: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and meaning (“each line a scar on the landscape of loss”). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and thematically aligned, avoiding mixed metaphors or serious muddle. There’s little obvious scaffolding or synonym loops, and the closing sentences land cleanly in image rather than exposition. The main limitation is a near-constant high lyric register that could benefit from a few plainer, sharper contrasts, but it doesn’t obscure causality or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is strong and often beautiful, with high information density—lines typically carry atmosphere, theme, and character at once. However, figurative language is very dense, with metaphor on nearly every beat, which occasionally edges toward purple and diminishes impact through saturation. There are minor redundancies (“seeking rumored cures in discredited textbooks” echoed almost verbatim) that could be trimmed. Rhythm and clarity remain intact, but tightening would be needed for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly clean, musical, and information-dense, with sensory detail doing double duty as mood and meaning. Repetition of certain phrases and constructions (“softly persistent,” several similar “quiet [X]” formulations) edges toward over-patterned, and some metaphors are comfortably familiar rather than striking. There’s little in the way of scaffold or synonym churn; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. The prose is polished and publication-ready with only minor trims for redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: the prose is dense but generally precise, with imagery that does multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and character interiority) without obvious scaffolding. There are no noticeable synonym loops or template cadences, and the rhythm carries momentum forward through the journey rather than stalling on description. A few metaphors (“negative space that hurt to look at directly,” “equations older than language”) flirt with abstraction but remain legible and grounded in the scene. Overall, sentences read cleanly and aloud-worthy, with minimal excess.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences have good rhythm, rich imagery, and usually do multiple jobs, and there are no real clarity or grammar issues. A few places slide toward purple or paraphrase (e.g., reiterating disenchantment or the grotto’s memory function) and metaphors stack densely, occasionally feeling ornamental rather than necessary. Still, momentum is largely maintained, and the final images remain sharp rather than muddied. Tightening a handful of explanatory or redundant phrases would lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is polished and rhythmic, with strong, memorable images (threads of liquid light, a nautilus curl holding the first star’s heartbeat). Information density is fairly high and most sentences do more than one job. However, key phrases and concepts (“density of presence,” “revalue,” “resolve”) are reiterated in ways that feel like conceptual looping rather than escalation, and metaphor density occasionally borders on purple. The prose remains clear, but the repetition slightly dulls momentum and the sharpness of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and information-dense, with most sentences doing multiple jobs—world-building, emotional shading, and thematic signal—without major redundancy. Metaphor density is high but largely coherent, and repeated motifs (scroll, grave, mountains, stars) evolve rather than simply echo; there are few, if any, true paraphrase loops. A handful of lines border on purple or overly declarative abstraction (“a mountain range of when,” “the chaos had learned to sing in key”), which slightly dulls sharpness at peak moments. Overall, line-level craft is strong, readable aloud with good cadence and minimal scaffolding or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense; images like “watercolors in rain” and the clock’s “liquid heartbeat” are vivid and apt. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent and thematically aligned with water, fog, and translation, giving the piece a unified texture. There is mild risk of overwriting and conceptual repetition (“emotional terrain,” “reading between lines,” “ordinary miracles”) that nudges the piece toward preciousness in places. Nonetheless, momentum and clarity are never seriously compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often lovely, with strong sensory images (ink crystallizing, facets as chapters, tea tasting of “earth and memory”). However, line-level redundancy appears (“saturated hush” and breath/held-breath motifs recur without always adding new nuance), and some sentences restate prior content with slightly different ornamentation. Figurative texture is dense but generally coherent, just short of purple; a tighter cut could heighten each surviving image. Overall, it’s strong but not yet razor-honed for an elite literary journal.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong images like the mist “curling around the yellowed sheet music like a memory trying to remember itself.” Information density is high and most sentences multitask—advancing scene, mood, and theme together. However, metaphor density is occasionally excessive, with stacked figurative moves (“ghost of fragrance,” “walls of regret,” “cellar of memories”) that risk purple over-saturation. Trimming a few of these would sharpen the best lines and increase momentum at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and conceptual work at once. Imagery is consistent and rarely muddled; metaphors like “a universe's hiccup” and “entropy's yawn” are striking and legible. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, especially in the middle stretch, creating a slight purple density that can blur moment-to-moment momentum and emotional sharpness. The final beats remain clear despite the lushness, but a bit more spareness would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: clear sentences, clean syntax, and metaphors that are mostly coherent and purposeful. Repetition of key phrases (“razor edges,” “fjord quiet,” “counting backwards”) builds pattern but occasionally verges on redundant, especially when paired with directly stated insights. There are no major artifacts, loops, or muddled figures that obscure meaning. Tightening some reiterative lines and trusting the images more would lift the prose further.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, dense, and generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without clutter. Recurring motifs (permeable barriers, intrusion, bioluminescence, quiet wildfire) are patterned rather than accidentally repetitive, though the final third verges on thematic redundancy. Metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded in the story’s biology/technology logic. A slight tendency toward abstracted statements in the ending paragraphs marginally slows momentum but doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, well-paced, and image-rich, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. There is some tendency toward purple or repetitive abstraction (“language of probability,” “tapestry woven from risk and reason,” “maze of uncertainty”), but it doesn’t significantly obscure meaning or momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical cadence, and there are no major grammatical or clarity slips. Trimming a few near-synonymous metaphors would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The line-level writing shows good rhythm, image density, and clarity; sentences usually do double duty for mood and information without bogging down. The repeated motifs of hum, glass, and echo are well-managed, and the action beats (touching and shattering the disc, stepping out) are cleanly rendered. Some phrasing drifts into platitude or slogan (“the world opened its arms,” “teach endings how to begin”) and certain images are reiterated without fresh turn, which slightly blunts momentum and impact. Nonetheless, there are no significant artifacts, and the closure image is clear and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with clean sentences and rich but legible imagery (“its wooden planks softened by time and the scent of night-blooming jasmine”). Some repetition and conceptual echo (“proximate cause,” “haunted euphoria,” “weight of small moments,” “covenant”) verge on paraphrase loops and thematic hammering. A few formulations read as purple or abstract rather than precise, slightly slowing momentum. Even so, most lines do multiple jobs—advancing mood, theme, and character—and clarity is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with several striking images (the clock “frozen at midnight,” stories as a “rumor chain”) and minimal redundancy. Sentences do multiple jobs—advancing action while sustaining atmosphere—and there are no major syntactic or clarity issues. At times, the line-level texture drifts into summary or mildly purple abstraction (“harmonious resonance of shared loneliness turning into shared hope”), which slightly dulls immediacy at peak beats. Overall, it’s polished and publication-ready with only light tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, imagery is coherent, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. The tactile and sonic metaphors (“language of shivers,” “minor keys of sorrow”) are apt and not confusing. There is mild repetition of concepts and phrasing (“quiet blaze,” “language,” “map”) and a tendency in the closing paragraphs toward summarizing insights that could be more tightly rendered in image. It borders on purple in places, but not enough to obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with metaphor that largely holds together (light as spirals, timelines as residue, universe as manuscript). There is some repetition of key phrases and concepts (seeds, strange comfort, meaning from noise) that occasionally feels like paraphrase rather than fresh accretion. The prose flirts with purple but maintains clarity and doesn’t obscure causality or the closing image. A light pruning of near-duplicate insights would tighten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence structures, high information density, and figurative language that’s mostly coherent and thematically aligned (e.g., “photograph the absences where people should have been”). Repetition of key motifs (“mapping silence,” music, harbor) reads as patterned rather than as looped scaffolding. The prose sometimes pushes toward richness on every line, but it stops short of muddled or overwrought, and clarity is preserved through closure. There are no noticeable grammar or cadence artifacts that sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is tight, evocative, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for mood and narrative progression. Metaphors are mostly clean and thematically aligned (fire, ash, volcanic imagery, weaving), and there is little evidence of scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive sentence templates. Summary is used strategically to compress weeks of work without losing momentum, and the final lines land with clear, charged imagery. A few formulations verge on lushness, but they don’t obscure causality or blur the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with high information density—many sentences advance worldbuilding, emotion, and theme simultaneously—and strong control over imagery (“reflecting constellations that no longer existed” is a standout). Line-level clarity remains intact even when metaphors stack, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or repetition artifacts. That said, the figurative saturation sometimes nudges toward purple, especially in cumulative phrases like “auroral sorrow—beautiful, transient, and aching with loss,” which slightly risks redundancy. Trimming a few modifiers or metaphorical flourishes in high-pressure beats would sharpen impact without harming the lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are generally clean, with varied rhythm and good information density; most lines do double duty with worldbuilding and concept. Some phrasing edges toward purple or repetitive abstraction (“calculated spontaneity,” “sound’s secret passages,” “open the way sound travels”), but it remains legible and doesn’t stall momentum. The prose occasionally tells what’s already implied (e.g., reasserting what the key “really” is and what the maps “really” show), which could be leaner. Overall, the language has a distinctive texture without major artifacts or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally polished: rhythms vary, sensory detail is dense, and most sentences carry more than one function (image plus mood or theme). That said, there is noticeable repetition in structure and concept (“half-spoken secret” returns without new inflection; “teaching darkness the value of stars” feels like a restated thesis), and some metaphors pile up to the edge of purple. Momentum is more incantatory than propulsive, which suits the piece but contributes to a faint sense of sameness by the end. It’s elegant but not yet razor-edited for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and generally efficient, with most lines doing at least two jobs (atmosphere plus theme, or action plus symbol). There is some repeated conceptual phrasing and mild purple tint (“hush where past meets prophecy,” “forests of second thoughts”) but it remains legible and largely purposeful. The prose occasionally explains what the image already implies (e.g., restating the meaning of the puzzles), which slightly dulls impact. Still, line-level craft is above-average and clean, without major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: varied syntax, clear sequencing, and sentences that usually carry more than one job (image, mood, and motion at once). Some phrases flirt with purple (“world, for a moment, sang with her”) and a few thematic lines repeat information already implicit, but there are no major loops or muddled metaphors. The closure image—Mira riding the tide with the scrimshaw in hand—is clean and resonant on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains strong images (shavings as “silent confessions,” turbines as scissors cutting the sky) and clear, grammatical sentences. Yet there is notable repetition of concepts and structures (“remade hush,” “blank canvas,” reiterations of whittling/narrating as rebellion) that sometimes restate rather than deepen, creating a mild paraphrase-loop effect. Figurative language is frequent but usually coherent; still, the density of similar metaphors around void, hush, and canvas begins to feel formulaic rather than surprising. Tighter pruning and more varied imagery would sharpen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong sonic and imagistic control, and sentences typically do more than one job (advancing setting, mood, and theme together). However, there are paraphrase loops and near-duplicate moves—multiple lines about dissolving boundaries, paraphrasing humming, and re-describing certainty—that don’t add new pressure or specificity. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent; it edges into purple yet remains legible. Trimming repetition and sharpening a few abstractions would bring the line-level work into top-tier range.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is fluent, imagistic, and largely economical for its mode, with several striking lines (e.g., “each a frozen breath of memory”). Sentence rhythm varies well, and most images do more than one job (worldbuilding plus theme). There is mild repetition of key abstractions (“awakening,” “imperfect,” “legend”) and a tendency to tell the thematic point in the last sentences, but no major loops or figurative muddle. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and publishable with modest tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are mostly lean and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme; the rhythm is varied and the prose largely reads clean. Figurative language (“shadows like molasses,” “a landscape she could climb”) is rich but usually coherent and well-chosen for the sound/texture motif. There is some mild purple-leaning abstraction and occasional commentary-like restatement of already dramatized ideas, but it doesn’t significantly obscure momentum or clarity. No major loops or structural artifacts mar the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are information-dense, often doing multiple jobs at once, and the figurative language is inventive yet mostly coherent and purposeful. Recurrent phrases like “genuinely artificial” and the star/grief metaphors form a deliberate pattern rather than mere ornament. At times the prose edges toward over-saturation of metaphor, which could fatigue some readers or slightly blur emotional immediacy. Still, there are no significant loops or scaffolding, and closure images are sharp and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are varied in length and rhythm, and images generally do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character all at once). Metaphors like “sacred geometry of greed” and rain as “tiny crystal of a broken economy” edge toward density but stay internally consistent with the story’s conceptual frame. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances atmosphere or idea. The main limitation at an elite level is occasional over-stacking of metaphor and abstraction, which slightly blurs immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is largely clean and rhythmic, with strong imagery and few technical errors, and many sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding plus mood, for instance). However, there is noticeable repetition of ideas and phrasing—“steadily unpredictable,” “end of innocence,” similar descriptions of light and memories—that creates paraphrase loops. Figurative density occasionally borders on purple, with stacked modifiers that restate rather than deepen (“tiny atom, beautiful yet tainted by sorrow”). These issues dampen momentum and sharpness enough to keep it below a top-tier line-level score.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with information, often doing character, world, and theme work at once. The imagery is frequently striking and coherent (“its edges fraying like old film”; “a carpet of clouds tinged with amber”). There is some tendency toward repeated abstractions (“shape of hope,” “luminous,” “softly deliberate”) that could be grounded more often in concrete sensation. Still, no major loops or figurative muddles undercut the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in length and structure, carry multiple functions (image, emotion, and action at once), and rarely feel redundant. Figurative language is generally fresh (“starlight bleeding through like liquid silver,” “the quiet vividness of night-blooming jasmine”) and does not muddle clarity. There is a mild tendency toward density of metaphor and abstraction in a few spots, which edges close to purple but doesn’t quite cross the line. Overall, momentum and clarity are preserved, and the final images land cleanly without textual artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line-level writing is smooth and generally clear, with good rhythm and some effective images (the hourglass’s sand “flowing like liquid silver”). There is noticeable repetition of certain words and concepts (quiet, hush, dawn, whispers, stories, scars) that edges into redundancy without always adding new nuance. A few phrases veer toward purple or slogan-like sentiment, softening the edge of the imagery. Still, sentence structure is varied, grammar is clean, and momentum is preserved despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and largely precise, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and concept; images like “love unused…became dense as neutron star matter” and “each step writing new letter into pavement’s latent silver” are striking and legible. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, with only occasional verge into purple or conceptual redundancy (“forgotten lyrics searching tune” is reused a bit). Sentence rhythm varies and momentum rarely stalls despite the lyric density. A light line edit to trim a few repeated motifs and slightly overloaded phrases would bring it to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally clean and controlled, with few if any grammatical or clarity issues. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; some phrases (“shadowed rapture,” repeated motifs of stardust) verge on purple or redundant. There’s some conceptual looping—multiple sentences restating her blocked state and the cosmos’ whispers—yet momentum survives due to brevity and variation. Stronger pruning and a few more concrete, non-cosmic specifics would sharpen impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is dense but largely precise, with many sentences doing multiple jobs—worldbuilding, theme, and forward motion—without obvious scaffolding or looped restatement. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent and on-theme (possibility as seeds, time as a chess clock, dunes as memory-bearing sand). There are minor moments of near-purple abstraction and slightly fuzzy logic (“midnight” vs. “2:00:01”), but they don’t materially obscure causality or closure. Rhythm and sentence variety carry momentum appropriately for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, dense but mostly purposeful figurative language, and very little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Repeated motifs (gear turning, hum of insight, different biomes) are reprised with added weight rather than redundancy. A few lines border on generalized “poetic” abstraction without adding new information, slightly softening momentum in the middle. Nonetheless, clarity holds and the final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean, generally clear, and often pretty, with some strong images (the lantern “like a star fallen onto the water,” the star-stamped ticket as “a tiny constellation of permission”). Yet there is substantial repetition and paraphrase—of phrases (“gentle, persistent,” “shoreline lullaby,” “unused courage waits”) and of concepts—which reduces information density and momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always doing new work, edging toward purple in places. These issues remain short of obscuring meaning but would likely need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, clear, and dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Imagery (“snow pressing against the windows like a mourner’s hands,” “seraphically mundane”) is vivid yet mostly controlled, rarely tipping into purple or redundancy. There’s little scaffolding or repetition; nearly every line advances mood or understanding. A couple of thematic statements could be slightly compressed or more fully embodied to avoid feeling aphoristic, but overall the prose is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful, with high information density and many lines doing dual work for atmosphere and theme. However, it occasionally tips into purple repetition and metaphor stacking (“pause between heartbeats of the cosmos,” “slow lung of eternity,” “graceful collapse of forgotten epochs”), which blurs impact and feels overdetermined. Some near-duplicate phrases around collapse and unraveling could be tightened without loss. Rhythm is varied and generally propulsive, but a stricter line edit would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is clean, with clear syntax, minimal clutter, and images that generally pull their weight (“each bleaching a silent scream,” “a world that had moved beyond fossil fuels”). Some phrases repeat in a way that risks slight overemphasis (“periodically eternal,” variations on paths disappearing), and a few explanatory sentences could be trimmed without loss. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the final paragraphs land with a quiet, earned cadence. There are no major figurative muddles or scaffold artifacts to undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally precise, multi-functional, and propulsive, with vivid but controlled figurative language (“thunderous serenity,” “a lull in rebellion…a disease of waiting”). The prose sustains a lyrical texture without collapsing into purple; most metaphors are thematically aligned and legible. There are a few dense constructions that stack abstractions (“violent peace and silent storm”) and come close to saturation, but they don’t seriously obscure sense or momentum. Scaffolding and repetition are minimal, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally tight, image-rich, and purposeful, with lines often doing double duty for worldbuilding and character. Metaphors (e.g., hope fossilizing into dogma, bamboo as memory) are coherent and thematically apt, and there’s little scaffolding or redundancy. Momentum is maintained despite reflective passages; sentence variety and paragraphing support readability. Some thematic lines drift toward essayistic abstraction, slightly dulling the impact of otherwise strong imagery near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, imagery apt, and most lines do double-duty for atmosphere and psychology (“edges worn soft as velvet from daily handling”). There’s good concision with few true scaffolding sentences, and the rhythm shifts appropriately between description and insight. Some phrases and concepts repeat a bit too often (“pearl of stillness,” “somatic markers,” “optimism anchored in realism”), edging toward thematic hammering rather than allowing implication to carry the weight. The prose approaches, but largely avoids, purple; the main cost is a mild sense of over-explanation in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences often do multiple jobs (world, mood, interiority), and the read-aloud rhythm varies smoothly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and purposeful, with striking images such as “time was a medium now, not a master, and it flowed like wet ink.” There is minor repetition (the “luminescent ache” returns; some metaphors stack) that risks overload at this length. Still, clarity and propulsion are preserved, so the piece clears the bar for elite-level polish, if just shy of pristine minimality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong images (“his pale skin seemed to drink the returning light,” “each grain of sand hanging in the air like a suspended breath”) and good sentence-level flow. That said, there is noticeable repetition of key terms and constructions (“conscious wildness,” “serene anger,” “ephemeral patterns,” “time slowed in crisis”), which creates mild echo and a sense of conceptual looping. A few sentences restate the same idea in different words, especially around his theorizing about the ink and time, which slightly drags momentum. Overall craft is above average but not yet razor-edited to elite tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally lean for its lyricism, with most sentences doing double duty—advancing action while maintaining atmosphere, as in the reactivation of the pneumatic tubes. Sound and rhythm are carefully handled; the story reads aloud with pleasing variation and no obvious template cadence. There is some tendency toward high-density metaphor and reiterated formulations (“contraband truths,” “dizzying quiet”) that flirt with over-ornamentation but stop short of muddling sense or slowing momentum. Line-level clarity remains high throughout, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong: clear syntax, varied rhythms, and purposeful imagery that often does double duty for setting and theme. There is some repetition of concepts and metaphors (quiet/fire/chaos) but not to the point of true looping or opacity. Figurative language is mostly coherent and effective, and exposition is efficiently folded into scene rather than delivered as lumps. The prose is polished enough for serious consideration, though a demanding venue would want minor tightening of redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is lush, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with many sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. There is clear control over cadence, especially around key beats (driving/withdrawing the spike, Echo’s question). At times the prose verges on density overload—clusters of figurative language and repeated constructions (“transliterated...”) could be pared slightly without losing music. Still, clarity is maintained and the closure image lands cleanly, so the occasional near-purple flourish doesn’t materially harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with strong images (“gravity well of silence,” “event horizon of red ink and editorial discretion”) and generally efficient sentences that do multiple jobs at once. Metaphor density is high but largely coherent and patterned around astronomy and journalism; it rarely feels random or mixed. There is mild risk of purple over-saturation and a few near-redundant phrasings, yet not enough to materially drag momentum or clarity. Tightening a handful of abstract lines would elevate it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, theme) with little waste, and the read-aloud rhythm is varied and controlled. Figurative language is dense but generally precise and internally consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple excess. There are minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops; progression from sentence to sentence feels purposeful and propulsive for a lyric piece. The only minor drawback is that the sustained, high-intensity metaphorical register can slightly blur peaks, leaving fewer moments of stark, plainspoken contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is dense and musical, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and worldbuilding, and rhythm that largely carries momentum forward. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and intentional; motifs like “lilac,” “whispers,” and “chalk” are reused rather than churned through synonyms. At times the prose skirts the edge of purple, and a few abstractions (“emergent hush,” “collective forgetting”) could be grounded with more concrete counterpoints, but clarity is maintained throughout. There is no significant looping, scaffolding, or syntactic monotony dragging the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and largely clear, with many lines doing solid atmospheric work and no major grammatical or syntactic errors. Yet the piece over-relies on a small set of metaphors and abstract pairings (“warm coldness,” “frost and flame,” “arms of steel”) and paraphrases its own insights multiple times. This repetition blunts impact and creates a sense of rhetorical looping instead of forward propulsion. The imagery risks purple in places without always adding new information or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished, largely grammatical, and often vivid, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and information. However, there is noticeable repetition and a tendency toward purple abstraction—“fractured timeline,” “echoes,” and “synesthetic symphony” recur without always adding new nuance. A few lines paraphrase what we already understand (“He wanted to lure possibility from the brink of despair”) instead of advancing pressure or image. The result is attractive but slightly over-scented, dulling momentum and preventing a higher craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythm varies, and imagery (“frozen auroras,” “fractal tree”) is concrete and evocative. There is some redundancy in concept and phrasing—“fractally precise,” “hidden pathways,” “willowglass hope,” and repeated beats of tingling and resonance could be tightened. The prose stays just shy of purple, occasionally layering figurative language on already-rich description without adding new information. Nonetheless, the closure image is sharp and unobscured, and there are no serious clarity or grammar slips.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, often doing atmospheric and thematic work at once. Some abstraction and repetition creep in (“voice of the unknown” appears multiple times; feelings are labeled more than embodied), but they don’t seriously bog momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; there’s little purple or muddled metaphor. The prose supports the accumulative mood well, even if it rarely takes formally daring risks.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density—most sentences carry world-building, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously—and minimal visible scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is abundant but controlled, with metaphors (resin, sap, buttons as syllables) internally consistent and rarely muddled. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no significant syntactic or grammatical slips. The only minor reservation is that the relentless metaphorical richness might, for some readers, slightly soften momentum in the absence of sharper scene-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and figurative language that usually does double duty (e.g., snow layers as both literal and symbolic). There are a few moments of near-overtness or repeat patterning (“silver hush,” explicit thematic statements), but they do not create loops or blur clarity. Transitions between action, reflection, and description are smooth, so momentum is preserved despite the reflective content. No major artifacts, tense slips, or syntactic clutter obstruct the read.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with many lines doing double duty—advancing action while deepening mood (“Each drop was a separate event, a universe of patience collapsing into itself”). Recurring metaphors of percolation, palimpsest, and ticking are mostly coherent and pattern-taught, giving the piece a unified texture. There is occasional purple density and conceptual repetition around the core motifs that an elite editor would likely trim for maximum impact. Nonetheless, rhythm, clarity, and sentence variety hold, and the closure image is clean and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level writing is polished and image-rich, with relatively high information density: many sentences do dual duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphors are mostly coherent and non-redundant (“phototropic to kindness,” “heart beating in the waste”) and avoid serious purple-prose muddle. A few abstractions and reiterated phrases (“sharp gentleness,” explicit thematic restatements) slightly soften momentum and subtlety, but they don’t obscure clarity or the closure image. Overall, the prose is strong enough for serious consideration in a top-tier venue, even if a light trim would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (image, emotion, theme) with few wasted words, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically linked (water, light, measurement), avoiding mixed-metaphor fog. There is some mild redundancy (“rhythm of oars in water” appears multiple times without always adding new pressure), but it doesn’t significantly blunt the closure. Grammar and clarity are clean, and the final lines land with crisp, memorable images.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level work is generally clean, syntactically varied, and information-dense; many sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and theme. However, figurative language is heavy and sometimes stacked (“atomically reflective, revealing the atomic dance of ancient sunlight trapped in bronze”), flirting with purple prose without always adding new pressure. There are mild paraphrase loops around the hums, memories, and “brittle awakening,” which slightly dulls momentum in a short piece aimed at elite venues. Clarity remains high, but a leaner, more selectively figurative surface would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density—most sentences do double duty for image and emotion. Line-level clarity holds throughout; cause and effect are never obscured despite the lyricism. That said, metaphor and elevated diction are used very frequently, leading at times to a faint purple sheen and a sense of repetition in tone and imagery. Tighter contrast—more plain, grounded lines around key peaks—would sharpen rather than soften the story’s strongest moments.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is generally tight: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and plot) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors like “paint peeled from the walls like dead skin” and “interference patterns now dissolving…like frost under sunlight” are vivid and legible, and figurative density stays just short of purple in high-pressure beats. Syntax varies enough to sustain momentum, and crucial causal steps are clear. A few formulations (“malevolent intent,” “cosmic tricksters”) verge on stock or on-the-nose, but they don’t materially blunt the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is generally strong, with varied sentence rhythms and many images doing double duty for mood and concept (organ-notes as corridors, silence as secret chambers). However, figurative density is high, and certain motifs (“whisper,” “fallow,” overt abstractions like “spatial mutiny,” “wistful rebellion”) recur in ways that feel slightly redundant and occasionally purple. Some conclusions are stated twice in close proximity, creating mild paraphrase loops and softening momentum near the end. Despite this, clarity and propulsion remain intact and the closure image is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and mostly lean, with many sentences doing double duty—advancing plot while layering image or interiority (“She didn’t see faces; she saw geometries of grief, ratios of loss”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors like “lancing” the portrait and “furrowed hush of stone” are coherent and thematically aligned rather than decorative clutter. There’s minimal scaffolding or repetition, and rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. A few lines slide toward purple or explanatory (“It was accurate, but hollow”) where image could suffice, modestly limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally vivid and efficient, with many lines doing double duty for mood and information (“ghost of Vance’s camp emerging from the melt like a developing photograph” is especially strong). Momentum rarely stalls, and there’s little scaffolding or obvious synonym-churn; technical and thematic terms are integrated cleanly. That said, some metaphors are repeated or heavy-handed (“spongey dread,” “frozen claws,” explicit coffin hollowness), and the thematic assertions in the last third slightly blunt the earlier, more suggestive imagery. Overall line craft is above average and publication-ready with a tightening pass for repetition and overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally strong—image-rich, rhythmically varied, and concise enough to maintain momentum, with very few outright clunkers. Many lines do multiple jobs, folding atmosphere, theme, and character perception together. However, there is noticeable repetition of key coinages and concepts without sufficient modulation, which starts to feel like slogan churn (“pixelated amnesty,” “luminous disbelief,” the motivation line repeated nearly verbatim). A bit of tightening and fresher variation on those motifs would lift the line-level craft into a more elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally smooth and rhythmic, with strong sensory images and a clear through-line, and there are few outright clunky sentences. At the same time, it verges on purple in spots, with stacked abstractions and repeated motifs that sometimes restate rather than deepen (“polished calm” and the circle metaphors recur with limited new information). The final paragraphs in particular loop the insight about circles and stillness, which slightly dulls momentum. Nonetheless, information density is decent and grammar and sequencing are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and generally high-density, with many lines doing double duty for world-building and theme (e.g., “histories trapped in photonic amber”). While the figurative language is frequent, it’s mostly coherent and purposeful rather than purple; a few abstractions (“human resilience,” “relationship with time itself”) flatten rather than sharpen, but they don’t obscure sense. There are minimal redundancies or scaffolding sentences, and syntax remains clear even at its most lyrical. The main limitation is occasional over-explication in the latter third, where the language tells what the images could have carried alone.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and fluid, with vivid images and few syntactic or grammatical missteps; most sentences carry clear narrative or atmospheric weight. Some metaphors are strong, but others verge on purple or clichéd abstraction, and there is mild repetition of structures and phrases across the piece. The prose maintains momentum without obvious scaffolding, loops, or confusion. It’s solidly above-average, though it would benefit from trimming a few generic modifiers and sharpening a couple of mixed or overfamiliar images.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density and vivid metaphors that often do double duty for mood and theme (“dreamstuff leaking through the seams of reality like sap from a wounded tree”). Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is maintained despite a reflective, mythic mode. However, figurative language is quite dense, bordering on purple at times, and a few phrases feel ornamental rather than necessary. There are no major clarity issues or loops, but a touch more spareness in key beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and mostly do double duty for atmosphere and character. Recurrent phrases (“inlaying meaning everywhere,” “fiercely gentle,” “dusky resolve”) feel intentional motifs rather than scaffolding, though they flirt with overuse. The prose occasionally edges toward purple but remains clear and rhythmically controlled, especially in the memory-pouring sequence. There are no significant loops or muddled metaphors that obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is competent and often graceful, with recurring metaphors of echoes and breath that build a coherent texture. Sentences mostly do double duty—advancing setting and interiority together—without obvious scaffolding or loops. However, the prose leans toward repetition in concept (“echo,” “encore,” “applause,” “silence”) and uses some stock phrasing (“wrest meaning from the silence,” “every ending is a prelude”) that blunts impact. Tightening clichés and trusting images over abstractions would sharpen momentum and distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally excellent: dense yet legible, with many sentences doing double-duty for worldbuilding and theme (“From the seed, a translucent root emerged, seeking not earth but the analogical space between sign and meaning”). There are no serious artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors; imagery is coherent and thematically pointed. The final paragraphs lean more on conceptual statement than fresh concrete image, and phrases like “haunted ambition” and “touching distance” recur with a slightly mantra-like feel, suggesting minor tightening opportunities rather than structural weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level is lush but mostly disciplined: metaphors are coherent and grounded in the world’s materials (brass, tides, glass, reeds), and sentences regularly do double duty for atmosphere and character. Rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from becoming monotonous, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Some end-run sentences lean toward thematic summary, creating a faint sense of over-articulation, but they do not obscure clarity or dull the closure image. Overall information density and clarity remain high despite the figurative richness.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally high: sentences carry multiple functions, imagery is often striking, and rhythm supports the accumulating hush-to-chorus movement. There is some density of figurative language (“memory of sound compressed into stone,” “walls between hearts”) that veers toward purple or redundant in the final third, but clarity remains intact. Trimming a few explicit metaphors and summary lines would tighten momentum without sacrificing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with strong sensory detail and a manageable lyricism that seldom obscures clarity. There are noticeable paraphrase/repetition patterns (“raw solace,” “broken things could still sing,” duplicative mentions of the graffiti’s wisdom) and some metaphor stacking around wounds, stains, and flowing truth. These create a slight sense of over-insistence and reduce momentum in places but do not damage the closure image. Most sentences do at least two jobs—setting mood and advancing character—keeping overall density acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally clean, with clear syntax, few redundancies, and images that do multiple jobs (e.g., fog as secrecy, breathing leather as animate text). There is some repetition (“cautious exuberance,” recurring technical metaphor) and occasional risk of purple or slightly over-explained metaphor (“propagation of a secret through propagation delays”), but not enough to obscure meaning or slow momentum significantly. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the paragraphs turn efficiently through the story’s beats. The prose is strong and competent, though it doesn’t yet show the ruthless compression or surprise that would mark top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Motifs (promise’s glow, perforated destiny, dewdrop, garden) recur in a controlled pattern that supports closure rather than feeling like synonym churn. The prose skirts the edge of purple at times, with figurative language in many lines, but metaphors are coherent and rarely mixed, and momentum is preserved. There are no significant scaffolding loops or clarity glitches that blunt the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with high information density—most sentences do double duty in worldbuilding and emotional shading. Figurative language (e.g., the emerald as “a green mouth drinking starlight”) is vivid and coherent with the cosmological grammar the piece establishes. While the diction is uniformly elevated and metaphor-rich, it rarely feels purple or redundant, and syntactic variety keeps the rhythm from becoming drumlike. The main ceiling is that the unbroken lyric texture slightly blurs micro-shifts in pressure that sharper line modulation could spotlight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, emotion, theme) with minimal redundancy, and imagery is vivid yet largely controlled. Metaphors (“clouds that pooled like spilled milk,” “other people’s nostalgia, sharp and hollow as wind through limestone”) are fresh and not over-stacked. The prose occasionally leans toward density in thematic statements, but it doesn’t slip into muddled or purple territory, and momentum for this lyric mode is well maintained. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolding, or mechanical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean and fluent, with some strong images (the shard splitting light; chimes as choices), and syntax varies enough to avoid mechanical rhythm. There is mild redundancy—repeating the campfire spark line, restating the role of doubt—and occasional purple or abstract phrasing that could be tightened. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it skirts overwriting without quite tipping into muddle. Momentum holds across the piece, though trimming would sharpen pressure and reduce the sense of thematic paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often beautiful, with strong images (“starlight silver on the surface,” “backward years peeling away like autumn bark”) and a good ear for rhythm. That said, figurative density is very high, and some sentences paraphrase earlier ones conceptually (reiterating vanishing/appearing, truth woven, lesson complete) without adding new nuance, slightly dulling momentum. A few lines verge on purple or pseudo-profound abstraction, especially where insights are summarized rather than dramatized. Overall, line-level craft is solid and above-average, but could be tightened for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and information-dense; many lines do multiple jobs of worldbuilding, mood, and concept at once. Repetition of certain phrases (“through centuries of layered dust,” “canyon of endless echoes”) reads more as incantatory pattern than accidental looping, though there are a few near-duplicate sentiments that could be sharpened or cut. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and thematically aligned (stone/bone/dust/time), with little true purple sprawl. Line-level momentum holds from start to finish without scaffolding or confusing syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, dense, and purposeful, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. Rhythm and sentence structure vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are few, if any, true scaffolding or paraphrase loops. At times, abstractions and repeated formulations (“lingering luminance,” “accommodated impossibilities,” “brilliant dimness”) verge on decorative, slightly softening momentum and immediacy. Nonetheless, clarity is preserved and the closure image is sharp, so these do not materially harm the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid metaphors, clean syntax, and good cadence shifts between description and insight. Almost every sentence carries atmospheric or thematic weight, with minimal scaffolding or redundancy. There is a tendency toward figurative density (“luminous vows,” “meteor hush,” “color of sound”) that verges on purple but remains mostly coherent. A sharper rationing of repeated key phrases near the end would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and generally efficient—most lines do double duty in image and concept (“treating each pop and hiss as a dialect of loss” is exemplary). Metaphoric language is frequent but mostly coherent and aligned with the world’s physics and mood. There are a few borderline-purple or slightly on-the-nose phrases (“cosmic afterbirth noise,” “causality’s corpse”) and occasional conceptual redundancy around static and alignment, which modestly reduces sharpness. Still, rhythm, clarity, and information density remain high, especially in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and multi-function images (e.g., the prism’s spectrum over the serpent’s eye simultaneously handling setting, magic, and theme). There is some tendency toward density—metaphor stacked on metaphor and repeated constructions around “scattered light” and “echo”—but it stops short of genuine purple muddle. A few late explanatory lines slightly flatten momentum, yet most sentences still advance character, atmosphere, or concept without scaffolding or loops. With a small trim of overt thematic phrasing, this would read as fully publication-ready at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, image-rich, and multi-functional, advancing atmosphere and character alongside plot. Repetitions (“brittle devotion,” “earnestly naive,” references to dripping) read as intentional leitmotifs rather than scaffolding, and there’s little to no synonym churn or padding. Figurative language is coherent and on-theme (cosmos, tides, balance, starlight) without tipping into purple excess. The only thing holding it short of the very top band is that the emotional and rhythmic variation, while graceful, never quite risks sharp or surprising turns in diction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and well-paced, with strong image choice (e.g., “ghostly outlines of Oakhaven,” “perfume of resurrection”) and minimal redundancy. Line-level clarity is high and there are no major syntactic or metaphorical misfires, and the closing paragraphs land with a controlled, measured cadence. The main limitation is a tendency toward mild abstraction and repeated “meaning” language, where a few sentences explain what the images already imply, which keeps the line-work from feeling as ruthlessly distilled as top-tier literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, densely imagistic, and usually do multiple jobs at once (world-building, mood, theme). There is some purple-prose risk—metaphors like “a color between heartbeats” and “the miracle of pattern recognizing itself” flirt with abstraction—but they remain intelligible within the established poetic mode. Repetition is purposeful rather than scaffolding, and there are no obvious loops or syntactic ruts. A light trim of the more slogan-like phrases would lift this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some strong images (“city’s lights flickered like restless fireflies,” the buckle glinting in starlight). Yet there’s noticeable looped language and conceptual redundancy around “burden,” “trust,” “soundless echo,” and “nocturnal arbor” that adds weight without new information. Figurative texture clusters in many lines, approaching purple at times without always sharpening sense. Trimming repeated sentiments and varying rhythm would improve momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often strong and image-rich (“light arced between them in silver-blue veins,” “stones melting like ice in the sun of causality”) with good momentum and clear sequencing. There is occasional purple or redundant abstraction, especially in the final thematic paragraphs, where ideas are reiterated rather than sharpened. Figurative density sometimes piles on instead of varying texture, but it rarely obscures meaning. Line-level craft is solid and publishable, though a stringent edit could trim excess and heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, and a few images (the root cracking toward the brook, moonlight as “silver ribbons”) are effective. Yet the prose often slips into redundancy: “safeguarding a space for innovation,” “orthogonal,” “storm born silence,” and “hush of a possibility just born” recur without added nuance. Many lines do single, declarative jobs (restating theme) instead of layering character, setting, and motion, which blunts momentum. The cumulative effect is polished but somewhat padded, falling short of the compression and sharpness expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is vivid and information-dense; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and psychology without obvious scaffolding. Recurring metaphors of maceration and sound rarely feel redundant and help unify the texture instead of looping meaninglessly. There is some risk of lyrical overload (“mournfully eager tune,” “bruised fruit,” “macerated the hard silence”), but syntax remains clear and momentum steady, and no figurative muddle obscures causality or closure. Line-level control is strong enough for elite venues, with only a hair’s breadth of purple at the thematic wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is high: nearly every sentence does multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and character) without obvious scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent and thematically aligned; motifs of frost, mist, pages, and thresholds are handled with clarity rather than purple muddle. The progression of images toward the final door-in-mist moment has good propulsion for a lyric piece. If anything, the relentless metaphorization risks slight saturation, but clarity and the closure image remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images (“tree of frozen glass,” “pale fire-flowers that gave no heat”), good sentence-level rhythm, and high information density with few wasted lines. Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful, and the final paragraphs land with a clean, echoing cadence. There is some mild redundancy and aphoristic overstatement around the penny/hope/destiny explanations, which feel more like commentary than necessary scene work. Those moments slightly drag momentum and prevent the piece from entering the very top band of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, dense with information, and generally do more than one job, keeping momentum despite a reflective bent. Figurative language (“silence as presence,” “geometry of patience”) is frequent but controlled and thematically aligned, rarely muddling sense. There’s minimal scaffolding or synonym loops; most lines advance scene or concept. The prose edges toward purple in a few spots, but clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level writing is generally clean and readable, with only minor redundancy and no major grammatical issues. Some phrases and images repeat with little new pressure (“resiliently positive,” “permanent transient,” “starlight pooling”), creating a faint sense of looped scaffolding. Figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally drifts into abstraction or cliché-adjacent constructions (“beyond reality,” “home was a moving horizon”). The prose does its job and sometimes charms, but it lacks the sharpened, ruthlessly precise density expected at elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, image-rich, and generally do multiple jobs at once without tipping into muddle. Metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (thread as synapses, water as connection), and there’s little to no scaffolding or redundant phrasing. The density of figurative language is high, but rhythm and clarity hold; I don’t see mixed metaphors that damage key beats or closure. Minor tightening could trim a few near-synonymous abstractions, but this is near publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The line-level writing is generally strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically aware, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and theme. The recurring anchor images and pressure/geometry metaphors are mostly coherent and effective. There is some conceptual redundancy in reusing “unfolded horizons,” “edge geometry,” and similar constructions in quick succession, and the adverbial “balancedly curious” clangs slightly as a neologism. These are minor artifacts rather than structural problems, so momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and strong sensory images that maintain momentum rather than stall it. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent and layered (“voices thin as fog,” “curiosity flares like a struck match”). There is some repetition of motifs and a slight drift toward purple in places, yet it rarely muddies clarity or causality. Minor tightening could trim redundancy, but line-level craft is clearly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is dense but mostly efficient, combining atmosphere, worldbuilding, and emotional state in multi-function sentences. Repeated metaphors around phase transitions, pressure, and ghostprints are coherent and not contradictory, passing the figurative logic test. There are no noticeable scaffold loops or cadence templates, and the final lines land cleanly. At times the figurative density (“place that had forgotten how to distinguish between breath and binary”) risks purple, and a touch more variation between concrete and conceptual phrasing would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with varied rhythm, high information density, and evocative metaphors that mostly hold (“ink spread like nerves,” “ghost file,” “quiet curtain over the opal dome”). There is some conceptual and lexical repetition around “failure,” “map,” “fragmented/fractured,” and “lesson learned” that slightly blunts impact and introduces a faint sense of scaffolding. A few closing phrases lean toward cliché compared to the more original early images. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum are maintained, and no figurative muddle undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is dense but controlled: most sentences perform multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and theme) without feeling redundant or padded. Figurative language is original and coherent with no mixed-metaphor muddle, and repetitions like the “enough to…” triad read as intentional cadence rather than scaffolding. There are no obvious synonym loops or mechanical templates; rhythm and syntax adjust to the pressure of the moment. The high-poetic register sustains itself without collapsing into purple prose or obscuring clarity at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often striking, and many sentences do double duty for mood and action. Yet there is considerable repetition of key phrases (“cosmic joke,” “harmony untamed,” “static-laden,” “frostbitten hope”), which can feel like scaffolding rather than deliberate refrain. Figurative language occasionally grows diffuse (“the garden erupted in laughter”) without adding new precision, contributing to a mild purple-prose haze that slows momentum. Trimming redundancy and sharpening a few metaphors would significantly tighten the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight, vivid, and multi-functional, with many lines carrying setting, emotion, and theme at once (“Each note trembled like a dying ember in the gap between knowing and understanding”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and controlled, rarely slipping into muddle. There is some mild repetition of key phrases and a few concept-heavy sentences that could be pruned for maximum impact, especially near the thematic summation. Overall momentum remains strong and clarity is not compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often doing character, atmosphere, and worldbuilding work at once. Figurative language (“neon veins pulsing like a heartbeat,” “ghost in the machine”) is mostly apt and controlled, with only minor repetition of key phrases (“brittle hush”) and no real muddle. There’s little scaffold or synonym churn; almost every sentence earns its place. The rhythm supports momentum despite the lyricism, keeping the piece from feeling bogged down.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences have musical rhythm, vivid imagery, and good syntactic variety. There is some paraphrase and motif looping (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” variations on silence as seed/possibility) that begin to feel redundant rather than deepening. Figurative language is mostly coherent and concrete, though the density of metaphor occasionally risks purple excess. Momentum holds, but a sharper prune of repeated thematic assertions would increase power.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong: images are inventive yet usually clear, and most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, mood, and thematic hinting at once) without obvious redundancy. Figurative language is dense but not incoherent; the recurring gravitational and topological metaphors form a consistent lexicon rather than a jumble. There is some risk of saturation—nearly every sentence carries an image or concept—which slightly flattens dynamic range and could, in a more pressured scene, start to blur cause and effect, but here it remains legible. Syntax and punctuation are clean, with no major scaffolding or loop artifacts dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and story, and the piece reads smoothly aloud with few outright clunkers. Information density is high, and several images (“photons still deciding their path,” “deer made of longing,” the empty well) are genuinely striking. However, figurative language is nearly continuous, and certain constructions or motifs recur so often that they verge on purple and mildly dilute impact, especially in the final third. Trimming a few near-duplicate insights and tightening some modifiers would elevate it to top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Rhythm varies well, and most metaphors are coherent and tonally aligned, though a few phrases (“hush of cosmic possibility” twice, “improbably large,” “improbable longing”) verge on overuse or slight purple tint. There’s little scaffolding or redundancy; almost every line contributes to mood or concept. Tighter pruning of a few echoed formulations and abstractions could elevate it into a truly elite line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, often advancing setting, character, and theme at once. Metaphors (shipwrecks as “corroded constellations,” glass “mapped like a star chart”) are apt and non-muddled, and there’s little genuine redundancy beyond purposeful refrains. The prose mostly avoids padding or clotted description, maintaining forward momentum even through summary. Minor overtness in a few maxim-like sentences is more a tonal choice than a technical flaw, but it does slightly blunt the closing image’s subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally tight, musical, and image-rich, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character (“voice like a blade wrapped in silk,” “dust motes seem to hold their breath”). Sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are few if any true clutter or clarity problems. There is some mild over-insistence on key phrases and concepts (“quiet resilience,” explicit restatements of the door metaphor), which occasionally feels like thematic scaffolding rather than organic image-work. Even so, line-level craft is comfortably publication-ready with only minor trimming needed.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level writing is polished, with mostly clean syntax, strong verb and noun choices, and sentences that carry multiple layers of work (worldbuilding, theme, and action). Imagery like “the violet of a child's first laugh” or “the gold of a forgotten name remembered” is vivid and precise. There is some risk of purple prose and conceptual repetition (“radiant hush,” “color of wonder,” “between-ness”) that slightly blur edges and reduce momentum, but not enough to obscure causality or the closing image. Trimming a few abstract reiterations would enhance sharpness and drive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is polished, with high information density—many sentences do double thematic and imagistic duty—and a strong ear for cadence. Metaphors are generally apt and coherent (net as shroud/map, silence as something that can be woven and compressed into a pearl), and the prose avoids scaffolding and obvious loops. There is a tendency toward near-constant figurative language and occasional purple touches, which risks saturation but mostly stays just this side of overdone. Clarity of action and emotional state is never lost, including at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally precise and musical, with strong images like “each brushstroke a quiet question” and “its prayers recorded not in sound but in the silence of stone.” Sentences carry multiple functions—advancing action, character, and atmosphere—without much padding or scaffold. Repetitions around “silence,” “whispered,” and “methodical” mostly read as motif rather than loop, though a few thematic restatements could be trimmed for even greater density. There are no serious rhythm, clarity, or figurative muddle issues at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong: nearly every sentence carries dual work (image plus concept, or character plus theme), and there is very little scaffolding or redundancy. Metaphors are generally clean and purposeful (e.g., “Water pressed against the hull like an old regret”), and technical terms are integrated smoothly. A few abstractions risk mild over-articulation (“from kinetic grief to potential memory”), but they remain intelligible and on-voice rather than purple. Momentum holds throughout despite the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely clear and musical, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and concept (“Each design held a ghost in code, a presence that lingered between the lines like a half-remembered song”). However, figurative density is high and sometimes repetitive, with recurring constructions (“ghost in code,” “unspoken needs,” “tinkersong wonder”) that verge on mantra rather than fresh development. A few sentences paraphrase prior ideas without adding pressure, creating mild redundancy. Despite this, rhythm and syntax remain controlled enough that closure is not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and function; images like “ancient air bubbles and stress fractures become visible as delicate filigree” are precise rather than purple. Rhythm varies and paragraphs break at logical, emotionally resonant points (floors, revelations, final arrival). There is some mild conceptual redundancy around scattered light/hidden layers and a slightly didactic final sentence, but no major loops or syntactic monotony. Line-level craft supports, rather than obscures, the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, with strong verbs, precise images, and a good balance between forward motion and reflection; sentences often carry multiple loads (world, theme, character). The “spooled” and “memory” motifs are well-controlled and recur with purpose. There is some redundancy and near-mantra phrasing—especially the repeated thesis line—that slightly dulls the impact and risks feeling didactic rather than earned. Overall clarity and cadence remain high, with only occasional purple edging (“quiet, explosive testimony”) that doesn’t seriously obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level work is strong: rich imagery (“lightning captured in stillness,” “fractal dust that once was a library”) and generally efficient sentences that each carry multiple loads (setting, mood, theme). There is some repetition of concepts and diction (“fractal,” “infinite,” “limits,” “sky”) that edges toward redundancy and mild purple prose, especially in the final stretch. Still, clarity is never lost, and momentum generally holds despite the lyric density. With some trimming of near-duplicate thematic statements, this could easily reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong sensory images and purposeful repetition (starlings, glow, wood and brass) that build atmosphere. Sentences vary in length and structure, and most lines do at least two jobs (worldbuilding plus tone or character). There is mild risk of over-ornamentation—the repeated “starling murmurations” and multiple invocations of glow and wonder could be trimmed for sharper momentum—but clarity remains high. No obvious scaffolding, synonym loops, or figurative muddles impair the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and at times striking, with some lines doing good double duty for atmosphere and theme. Yet it leans into purple repetition—phrases like “hauntingly bright,” “soft hush,” and “driftwood nostalgia” recur without new inflection, and many sentences stack metaphors in similar registers. There is some conceptual redundancy in restating the same idea of repair and nostalgia in slightly different words. Momentum holds, but the density of ornament occasionally blurs impact rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished, with strong image work (“droplets spiraled upward, forming a shimmering mist”) and minimal syntactic or grammatical distraction. Sentences typically do more than one job—worldbuilding, atmosphere, and thematic echo at once. There is some redundancy in abstract phrasing (“now family,” “brambled hope,” recurrent explicitness about collective effort) that risks mild overstatement. The language approaches, but mostly avoids, purple; a touch more pruning could sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often striking and information-dense, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme, and the closure image is clear. However, there is notable purple-leaning density: stacked metaphors (hush/time/ocean/silence/singing) and repeated formulations occasionally feel redundant rather than additive. A few lines paraphrase prior content in slightly altered language, which marginally slows momentum in such a short piece. Despite this ornamentation, clarity of action and stakes remains intact, so the line-level debt is moderate rather than severe.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is dense but purposeful, with most sentences doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion (“with the offhandedly exact steps of someone who'd memorized every dying root and poisoned branch”). Figurative language is vivid yet coherent; metaphors tend to a root/hand/finger motif that feels intentional rather than purple. There’s minimal redundancy and clean sequencing, so momentum never stalls despite the lyricism. A few sentences verge on ornate, but they don’t blur clarity or undercut the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line by line, the prose is clean, grammatical, and often striking, and many sentences carry dual duties of image and theme. Yet figurative language is heavily stacked—braids, symphonies, chains, ribbons, echoes—creating a sense of over-insistence rather than deepening. A few phrases and concepts repeat with minimal new pressure (“as the pieces fell into place” appears twice; grief as polymer/river braiding is restated), which slightly dulls momentum. Trimming or varying the metaphor field would sharpen impact and lift this closer to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is dense and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“books unfurling pages like leaves toward the moon”). There is a heavy concentration of metaphor and abstraction that occasionally risks purple prose, but most images are coherent and mutually reinforcing rather than muddled. Repetition (“quantifying absence,” “mindfully scattered”) is patterned rather than accidental and supports the conceptual lattice. A touch more variation between highly figurative and plainer lines might sharpen momentum, but clarity and cadence remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, precise, and multi-functional, often advancing setting, emotion, and theme at once (“grief was metallic, cold, with undertones of stale bread and ash”). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-true, and repetition tends to be purposeful rather than scaffolding. Momentum holds despite the lyric density; there are few, if any, paraphrase loops or clotted metaphors that confuse meaning. A very small trim of overlapping phrases (“sturdy, brittle,” “subsume,” etc.) could sharpen peaks even further.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clean, varied, and information-dense, with metaphor and repetition used in a controlled, patterned way. There is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. A few phrases edge toward sentimentality or thematic overstatement, but they do not significantly dull the closure image. Rhythm holds well across the piece without mechanical cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“rock faces shifting like neural tissue under the world's scalp”). There is some density-induced drag and a degree of repetition in concept and modifiers that edges toward purple, but clarity largely holds. Metaphor is intense but mostly coherent within the established neuro-geologic frame. Trimming a few near-duplicate formulations would sharpen momentum without harming music.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with generally clear sequencing and some strong images (gravity-revealed alcoves, heat-haze threshold, prism scattering moonlight). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition of key adjectives and concepts, and several sentences restate information with only minor variation, which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language edges toward purple in places without always adding new layers of meaning. Overall it’s competent and occasionally vivid, but could benefit from tighter compression and more varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, image-rich, and generally compact, with most doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Recurrent phrases like “Empathy in motion” and “tree-song sculptor, symphonically minded” approach self-conscious motif but do not quite tip into redundancy. Figurative language (cracks like sheet music, grove as cathedral) is apt and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. There is some mild conceptual repetition in the final third, but it doesn’t seriously blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, image-rich, and largely efficient; many sentences do double duty advancing character and atmosphere. The metaphoric web (chess, magnetism, eclipse, silence) is coherent with few if any mixed or strained images, and there’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding. There is a high density of figurative language, which edges toward “purple” in places and slightly flattens rhythm because almost every sentence reaches for a flourish. Still, clarity holds throughout, and the final image of the stone as a “dark moon” in silver dust lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and image-driven (“shadows pooled like ink,” “voice, thin as starlight”). There is some repetition and near-paraphrasing around silence, empathy, and fireworks that slightly dulls impact and edges toward purple in the final stretch. Still, most lines do multiple jobs—advancing both atmosphere and theme—and there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors. The closure image is crisp and not obscured by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and rich sensory detail; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and character/world-building. There is some tendency toward purple/overloaded phrasing and repeated conceptual motifs (wildflower hush, undercurrent, serenity) without added pressure, which could be tightened. Nonetheless, clarity remains high, and the final images are legible and rhythmically controlled. There are no serious scaffold loops or syntactic glitches that undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is polished: high information density, vivid metaphors, and varied sentence rhythms that mostly avoid scaffolding or redundancy. Phrases like “whirling silence” and “arches drifted like ancient bones” are memorable without tipping into incoherence, and exposition is efficiently woven into action. There is some risk of purple prose and abstract noun stacking in the final third (“genetic grief,” “attribute, the acceleration of plant growth, but raw and directionless”), but clarity and momentum remain intact. No major loops or mechanical errors appear, and the final image is syntactically clean even if thematically on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and generally economical, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and information. Image patterns (haze, labyrinth, convergence) are controlled rather than purple, and there’s little outright scaffolding or redundancy. Some phrasing edges into mild abstraction and repetition (“convergence,” “labyrinth,” thematic restatements), which slightly blunts momentum and surprise. Overall, the line-level craft is solid and publication-ready but not yet so sharp or inventive as to feel unmistakably top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences flow, rhythm varies, and figurative language is evocative without collapsing into incoherence. The prose maintains momentum, with most lines doing double duty for atmosphere and narrative. There is some repetition of key abstractions and the occasional near-synonymous restatement of already-clear ideas, which slightly blunts sharpness. Still, there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors, and the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: varied sentence rhythms, high information density, and vivid but controlled imagery that advances mood and meaning. Metaphors are mostly clean and apt (gravel “sang like broken glass,” vault sky “a bruised purple”), and technical errors are essentially absent. There are mild tendencies toward purple or redundant emphasis (silence and guardianship motifs are named a few times where one instance would suffice), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or dull the ending. Tighter pruning of repeated thematic assertions would push this closer to elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally tight and efficient, with most sentences carrying multiple loads (world-building, concept, mood) without obvious scaffolding or repetition. Metaphors tend to be consistent with the established lexicon of light, machinery, and mathematics, avoiding mixed or strained imagery. Rhythm varies enough to prevent drumbeat monotony, and the piece reads smoothly aloud despite its density. A few phrases verge on abstraction or redundancy (repeated invocations of “mathematics of emotion”), but they don’t materially harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level writing is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich, with solid economy for the length and few outright clunkers. However, there are noticeable redundancies (the “sprout grew into a silver-leafed tree” sentence appears twice almost verbatim) and some phrase-level repetition (“aurora-lit ridgeway,” “fade from memory to myth”) that feel more like scaffolding than intentional refrain. Figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally lapses into slightly purple abstraction. These small artifacts keep the prose from the sharpest, most compressed elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied in rhythm, images are generally coherent, and most lines do double duty with atmosphere and concept. The figurative language—quartz inhaling, frost as constellations and lace—is lush but not incoherent, and it supports the emotional temperature of the scene. There is little scaffolding or paraphrase looping; the prose moves steadily forward. At times, metaphor density is high enough that a demanding venue might ask for one or two trims in the most image-stacked passages.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and theme) with relatively little scaffolding or redundancy, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. Imagery is often striking and internally coherent; phrases like “a finished cloth rather than a torn one” land with clean metaphorical logic. There is some near-purple density (“compressed into something denser than time,” “silence grew thicker than the morning mist”) and repetition around “silence” and “raveling,” but it mostly reinforces the accumulative texture rather than obscuring it. No major loops or artifacts blunt the closure image, keeping momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: vivid metaphors (“color of twilight betrayed by dawn,” “a soft sound like grief turned inside-out”) and high information density with little dead scaffolding. Prose moves the story forward while building atmosphere, and there are no major loops or syntactic artifacts that slow momentum or blur causality. At times the figurative language edges toward lushness, but it stays coherent and controlled rather than purple.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatical, and the piece flows without major confusion; information density is decent for a short. However, there’s a tendency toward abstraction and repetition (e.g., “murmur,” “cycle,” “withheld truth”) and a few clunky constructions (“cyclically spontaneous rhythm”) that read more like prompt artifacts than natural prose. The climax leans on stacked concepts (“cascade of parallel universes,” “mirrored corridor of possibility”) that blur rather than sharpen the image. Line-level control is solid but not tight or surprising enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and generally economical; most sentences carry both atmosphere and story. Imagery is coherent and tactile (sea glass “smooth as a whisper,” stones like “silent sentinels”) without descending into muddled metaphor. There is some conceptual repetition around safety, luminescence, and ache that slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure sense or closure. Line-level craft is solidly above average but not yet razor-honed for maximal compression.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and economical at the paragraph level, with strong images like the crystal wick capturing starlight via total internal reflection. There is some conceptual repetition (“ancient shadows,” “shadowed elation”) and a tendency to summarize emotional stakes in similar formulations, but it doesn’t seriously drag momentum or obscure sense. Sentences almost always do at least one clear job, and there are few, if any, genuine artifacts or muddled metaphors. This is polished, competent line work suitable for good markets, though not yet razor-sharp at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally strong: vivid images, varied sentence rhythms, and high information density with little outright scaffolding. Phrases like “quietly explosive” and “iridescent caution” are striking and recur in a way that builds a recognizable texture rather than feeling random. However, figurative language is quite dense and sometimes repeated in near-synonymic fashion, risking purple over-saturation and slight momentum drag, especially when paired with explicit thematic statements. A touch more concision and restraint at peak beats would heighten the best images rather than competing with them.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, varied, and economical for the amount of imagery they carry, with few redundancies or scaffolding phrases. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled, and metaphors (“web of scattered dreams,” “smelled of salt and stardust”) feel internally consistent with the world. There is some mild abstraction, especially around the sorrow-number and “quantified grief,” that could be grounded more concretely, but it doesn’t significantly harm momentum or clarity. The closing cadence is clean and appropriately echoes the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with vivid figurative language and mostly clean syntax; the story reads smoothly and is easy to follow. However, metaphor and image density is high and occasionally borders on purple, with some conceptual repetition (constellations, woven dawns, swaddling, knitting) that doesn’t always add new information or pressure. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas about memory, song, and binding, which slightly dulls momentum. Tightening redundancy and varying imagery would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with several memorable lines and images. Nonetheless, it leans heavily on abstract phrasing and aphoristic formulations, especially in the final third, which occasionally dulls immediacy and feels a bit purple (“matryoshka dolls of meaning,” “ultimate paradox that compassion grows…” etc.). There is some conceptual redundancy around the paradox motif and her method of staying/leaving. Clarity is never lost, but a slight tightening and more concrete embodiment would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and generally efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (“wrapped in wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves” marries time, decay, and season). There is some density of figurative language, but patterns are coherent and rarely feel like strained ornamentation. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece: each paragraph adds a new facet of the ritual, the community, or the future outcome. A few abstractions (“conspiracy of silence,” “heuristically gentle persistence”) slightly thin the immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth at the sentence level, but it suffers from heavy repetition and conceptual loops (the same ideas restated with tiny variations across many lines). Metaphoric language is thick but rarely surprising, and the recurrence of stock abstractions (“meaning,” “oblivion,” “vows,” “hush”) erodes information density. Many adjacent sentences paraphrase each other without adding pressure or new detail, dulling momentum. This ornamental redundancy and mild purple-ness notably limit publishability at the elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. Metaphors (“like a forgotten promise,” “like a lullaby that hums just before a storm”) are largely apt and controlled, without stacking into opacity. There is some repetition of phrasing around trust breaking and silence that edges toward thematic hammering but doesn’t significantly slow momentum. No major scaffolding, loops, or grammatical issues undercut clarity, including at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are varied, images are generally precise, and most lines do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and character) without obvious filler. Metaphoric density is high but controlled, with recurring images (taste, geological memory, consensus) reinforcing rather than muddling meaning. There are a few near-repetitions and slightly ornate phrases that don’t add pressure, and some readers may feel the figurative load is almost too lush for the quiet conflict. Still, there are no serious artifacts, loops, or clarity breaks, and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and clear, with strong images like charcoal-stained fingers, mineral-dripped canvas, and the cave’s hum. However, certain motifs and phrases are reiterated with near-synonymous scaffolding (“inescapable calling,” “uncork suppressed creativity,” explanations of the lock not being the true barrier), edging toward mild overwriting. The closing paragraphs in particular stack thematic restatements that could be cut without losing meaning. Despite this, line-level control remains solid and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with strong, clear sentences and good information density; there’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Some metaphors echo each other a bit predictably (bruised sky, poison, oasis), but they’re coherent with the story’s imagery system and not so stacked as to feel purple. Occasional abstractions (“a heart full of light”) are slightly generic but don’t obscure clarity or undercut the closure image. Overall, the prose carries the piece smoothly and would require only light tightening for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush yet controlled: metaphors are coherent and thematically linked (sound, color, ice, light), and most sentences carry multiple functions—worldbuilding, mood, and theme at once. There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and the cadence supports the accumulative structure without bogging down. A few lines flirt with abstraction or redundancy, but they do not materially dull the closure. Overall, line-level craft is publication-ready in a high-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is consistently strong: sentences are varied, information-dense, and usually do more than one job (world, emotion, theme all at once). Metaphors like “static…like sand across stone” and “thoughts feel like shattered glass” are vivid, coherent, and voice-appropriate. There is a mild tendency toward repetition of key adjectives (“strangely organic,” “static”) but it reads as deliberate motif rather than synonym churn. No significant scaffolding, loops, or muddled metaphors interfere with clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and mostly efficient, with a good blend of sentence lengths and a pleasant rhythm. Several lines do double duty, advancing plot while maintaining atmosphere, and there is little scaffolding or synonym churn. Some repetition (“listening heals”) and declarative moralizing slightly dull the otherwise strong line-level work, and a few metaphors are on-the-nose rather than surprising. Momentum holds well despite summary passages, but dramatization at key turns could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences are generally tight, musical, and information-dense, often doing double duty for setting, character, and theme. Recurring metaphors of web, dance, and tide are controlled rather than muddled, and there’s little in the way of syntactic monotony or scaffold phrases. There is some conceptual repetition in later lines (“vulnerability turned strength,” reiterations of calm defiance and chance-tamed-by-dance), which slightly blunts impact. Overall, the prose is polished and publication-ready, with only minor trims needed for maximum sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: images are vivid (“cotton wool soaked in starlight,” “each facet humming with stolen moments”) and usually do more than one job at once. The rhythm mostly avoids scaffolding and repetition; there are no serious loops or muddled metaphors, and causality remains clear despite the lyric texture. Figurative language is frequent but not gratuitous, nearly always tied to gravity, light, salt, or memory, which keeps it coherent. A very slight reduction of metaphor density in the chamber sequence could increase impact by giving the sharpest images more space.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, and action at once), rhythm varies, and most metaphors are coherent and evocative. There is some density of figurative language and abstract phrasing that edges toward overwriting, with occasional near-redundant formulations (e.g., multiple iterations of “terrestrially cosmic” and re-explaining the hush’s effect). Still, clarity and momentum are preserved; we can always follow what the cranes and water are doing and how the ritual is unfolding. Tightening a few descriptive loops would lift this toward elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong information density and metaphors that are generally precise and apt (“fire escapes seemed to conjugate verbs of escape and return”; “limestone grammar”). Sentence rhythms vary well, and description tends to carry multiple loads (setting, theme, character). The figurative texture is rich but mostly avoids purple excess or muddle, and there’s little redundancy or scaffold phrasing. Very occasional metaphor stacking comes close to over-ornamentation, but not enough to drag momentum or obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are mostly lean, multi-functional, and rhythmically varied, with few redundancies. Imagery like “memory could be a quarantine, not a sanctuary” and “a membrane between worlds, not a prison” is striking without becoming opaque. There is some borderline purple density and a few repeated constructions (“tragically radiant,” “resonance structures”) that edge toward conceptual reiteration rather than fresh advance. Overall, momentum and clarity are preserved, but a light trim of abstract reiterations would further sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and multi-functional, often advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Some motifs and phrases recur to the point of mild redundancy (“marble sanctuary under aurora,” stalactites dripping, “pearl twilight”), edging toward over-insistence. Figurative language is mostly apt, though the density of soft metaphors (stone into silk, twilight as embrace) occasionally softens urgency. There are no major grammatical or structural slips, but a small tightening pass could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose shows ambition, with rich figurative language and some striking images (“each curve a throat that swallowed starlight and exhaled secrets”). Yet it leans heavily into repetition and near-duplicate phrasing—“reed-blown melancholy,” “secret song of the universe,” “serpentine nexus,” “webs of intrigue”—creating a sense of looped ornament rather than cumulative precision. Many sentences perform the same conceptual work (canyon breathes, universe hums, echoes linger) without adding new pressure or specificity, which softens momentum. Line-level clarity remains intact, but the density of similar metaphors and motifs edges into purple and would likely be pared in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmic, and information-dense, with imagery that tends to pull its weight. The recurring metaphors of starlight, ice, and windows cohere rather than conflict, and there’s little true padding or scaffolding. That said, some phrases (“borrowed starlight,” “weave truth carefully,” “windows of connection”) recur enough to verge on incantatory repetition rather than fresh intensification. The prose stops short of purple, but a touch more variation and a few sharper, less familiar images would better match elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally graceful, rhythmically varied, and rich in imagery, creating a sustained mood. Many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme, especially around the nets and fireflies. Yet there is clear redundancy in motifs and sentence-level paraphrasing (multiple near-identical descriptions of catching a firefly, stirring the air, whispering parapet), and some metaphors tread close to purple. Trimming repeated constructions and sharpening a few abstractions would noticeably increase density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lean yet textured, with high information density—most sentences advance both worldbuilding and character. Images like “reconstructing a skeleton from dust” and “recognizing a face through shattered glass” are apt and not over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. There’s minimal redundancy or scaffolding; rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum through largely expository material. A tiny fraction of lines verge on abstraction (“truth had become scarcer than clean water”) but they land as purposeful aphorism rather than cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with many lines doing double duty for atmosphere and theme (e.g., “rusted crown of antennas and prophecy,” “a parabolic dish pointed toward tomorrow”). Information density is high and momentum rarely stalls despite lyricism. That said, figurative language is nearly continuous—metaphor stacks like “storm reached its fist” and repeated abstractions (“ancient shadows,” “variant allegiance”) verge on purple and occasionally blur impact. Trimmed and varied textures would sharpen key beats and keep the strongest images from competing with each other.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight, evocative, and information-dense; many sentences do multiple jobs, advancing image, world, and theme at once. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and grounded, with only a few slightly overloaded phrases, and there’s little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Momentum is maintained despite the lyricism, and transitions between images and mini-beats are smooth. It falls short of the very top because the density of metaphor occasionally edges toward purple, and a couple of explanatory lines could be pared without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and motion) with striking but intelligible metaphors, and there are no real loops or scaffolding remnants. The prose borders on purple in places, with high metaphor density in nearly every line, but the vehicles are thematically coherent (sound, cold, metal, light) so clarity generally holds. Rhythm varies well, with some long, lush lines offset by shorter, grounding beats. A slightly leaner line in a few mid- and late-story sentences could sharpen momentum, but the closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line by line, the prose is concise yet textured, with many sentences doing double duty (world-building plus theme, or setting plus character). Figurative language (“skin of light,” “secret heartbeat,” “river dammed until its power could reshape stone”) is vivid and consistent with the established metaphoric palette. There is some recurrence of key terms, but it reads as pattern rather than redundancy, and there are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors that cloud the closure beat. Rhythm varies well, maintaining momentum through description-heavy passages.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and efficient; descriptive lines often do double duty as atmosphere and characterization (e.g., rust patterns “whispered of neglect”). There is some repetition of key words and metaphors (“reverberate,” drought/water, silence/control) but not enough to stall momentum or obscure sense. A few abstractions and mildly purple phrases slightly dilute otherwise strong, specific sentences and could be tightened for maximal impact. Line-level craft is solidly publication-ready, if not yet dazzling at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are musical, information-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy, and the opening and closing images are especially effective. Figurative language is generally apt (“each speck a tiny galaxy,” “vibrant hush”) and tied to character experience. There is some over-explanation and repetition in the metaphor chains (especially around light, grace, and “method”), which nudges moments toward purple and slightly dulls their edge. Tightening those overt thematic glosses would let the already strong imagery carry more of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence-level craft is tight and rhythmic, with high information density—most lines do double duty in worldbuilding and theme. Figurative language is inventive but generally coherent, and there’s little sign of scaffolding, repetition, or synonym churn. The prose sustains a rich lyric register without tipping into opacity or derailing momentum. A few concepts (“yearning algorithm,” “executable desire”) cluster near abstraction, but context keeps them grounded enough not to blur causality or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with some strong images (backup tapes as a “mournful hum”) and efficient sentences. However, there is heavy repetition of concepts and phrases—especially “echo of forgotten songs,” “ghosts,” and the number sequence—without each recurrence adding new information or pressure. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea of persistence of memory/absence, which blunts momentum. The lyric mode is apt, but tighter line-level pruning and more variation in imagery would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong: image-rich, rhythmically varied, and economical given the number of motifs in play. Lines often do double duty, carrying atmosphere and theme together (e.g., “Magic without empathy was just control in a finer dress,” “Time moved differently here, measured in reflections rather than hours”). There is some conceptual and syntactic repetition in the closing stretch that edges toward over-explanation rather than fresh layering, but it doesn’t seriously impede momentum or clarity. Figurative language remains controlled and coherent, with no major metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The line-level work is generally strong, with vivid sensory images and a good ratio of action to reflection for this mode. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (“windborne solace,” similar realizational formulations like “She realized that…” and “She understood that…”), but it doesn’t seriously muddy meaning. A few sentences veer close to abstractions or platitudes instead of concrete embodiment, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closing beats. Overall, the prose is publishable with light tightening to cut redundancy and lean harder on images over conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level writing is mostly clean and musical, with strong sensory images and few outright clunkers; sentences often do double duty for mood and theme. That said, there is noticeable redundancy of structures and concepts (reiterating the pavilion glow, the gentle persuasion, the cycles and understanding), and the figurative load occasionally verges on purple. Some abstractions (“intersubjective understanding,” “contours of a love”) dilute immediacy where a more concrete moment could carry equal meaning. The prose is above-average, but would need tightening and bolder selectivity to read as truly elite.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but there is significant synonym and structure looping (“Thus the…”, “And the…”, “In the whisperfield calm…”) that adds padding without new information. Phrases like “echo of wisdom,” “murmuring pavilion,” and “whisperfield calm” recur so often they lose force and create a sense of prose stagnation. Figurative language is mostly clear, yet the density of similar constructions dulls momentum and undercuts impact at the close. Trimming and varying line-level tactics would markedly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and mostly precise, with strong images like “dove gray map case that whispered against her hip” and “cathedral of remembrance” doing good double-duty. There is some repetition (“perceptively calm” appears multiple times) and occasional near-paraphrasing of ideas about grief and healing, but not enough to significantly drag momentum. Figurative language is dense yet mostly coherent, with few mixed metaphors. Line-level craft is very solid, though a further tightening of redundancies could elevate it to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and images that mostly do double duty for mood and theme (“a fossil of sound,” “dust motes that danced like forgotten letters”). There is minimal scaffolding or repetition, and transitions between reflection and present action are smooth. Figurative language is frequent but not so stacked as to blur clarity, and key beats—the crystal’s response, the null result on his name, the chained doors—are rendered with clean, direct phrasing. A few metaphors teeter on the edge of over-richness, but they never materially obscure cause/effect or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level work is polished and often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“their spools silent as memory,” “a label faded to a whisper”). Repetition of key words (“echo,” “tide,” “sound of growing older”) reads as intentional patterning rather than accidental looping. Figurative language is dense but mostly precise and coherent; it rarely muddies sense despite its frequency. A slight tendency toward over-explicit, abstract phrasing in the last third prevents it from feeling absolutely taut.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and often elegant, with sentences doing double duty for mood and concept. However, certain phrases are overused (“luminous ache,” “changelessly constant”) and some lines paraphrase the same emotional insight in slightly different words, nudging toward purple redundancy. Despite this, causality and imagery remain clear, and the final images land without being muddied by figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, with many lines doing double duty—advancing action while reinforcing motif or mood. Sentences are clear, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, and key images (the vinyl shard, clouds as sea, spun-glass voice) are strong. However, certain phrases and constructions recur enough (“scent of hope,” “radiant haven,” “pulsing stillness”) to feel slightly overworked, and some metaphors lean purple without adding new insight. The line-level craft is strong but would benefit from a touch more restraint and variation in figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, grammatically solid, and generally concise, with some pleasing images (“brass teeth glinting like frozen starlight”). Information density is good; almost every sentence either advances plot or enriches world and tone. There is some repetition of phrasing and concepts (e.g., the “quietly deliberate” motif, loops being “closed” and “relearned” without new texture) that could be tightened. Overall, it’s polished and readable but not yet at a line-by-line striking level.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythms and strong information density; almost every line advances character, world, or theme. Recurring metaphors (bones, maps, constellations, garden) are coherent and largely unforced, building a layered texture without lapsing into confusion. There are a few edges of purple or slogan-like phrasing (“make something better from the bones of what we broke,” “bone setting—not just for the dead, but for living stories yet to be told”) that feel slightly crafted for effect. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum remain high, and there are no significant loops, artifacts, or muddled images.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: clean syntax, precise word choice, and many sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Repetition of phrases and images (“pearl of stillness,” “share light without using fire,” the grotto’s patience) provides pattern but edges toward redundancy in the final third. There is mild overstatement where the text explains what images already imply, which slightly dulls the closing resonance. Still, there are no serious artifacts or muddled metaphors, and the prose remains clear and musical.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and generally high-density: most sentences do at least two jobs (advancing image and character, or setting and theme). Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled and legible, with very few mixed or strained metaphors; the text avoids obvious scaffolding or synonym loops. Rhythm on the sentence level feels deliberate rather than mechanical, and grammar/usage are clean. The only drag is a slight tendency toward lushness—multiple metaphors and abstractions layered in close proximity—that could be trimmed for even more impact without altering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is often beautiful, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (“wading through wet ink,” “eyes hold maps of unbuilt cities”). Figurative language is generally controlled and thematically unified around spirals, currents, and mist. There is some repetition of phrases and conceptual terms (“inside the whisper of closing pages,” “against the current,” “shapes of different hopes”) that edges toward over-insistence, slightly dulling momentum. Still, clarity remains high and there’s little genuine scaffolding or muddled metaphor in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, with vivid phrases like “notes drifted through the arbor like golden threads” doing multiple jobs at once. Repetition of motifs (“golden stories,” “gathering hush”) feels intentional rather than like scaffolding, and there are few if any paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent but not so dense as to become purple or muddled, and syntax is clear throughout. A touch more variation in imagery and slightly less direct summary near the end could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and generally high information density; most lines advance both image and emotion. Figurative language (“safekept starlight,” “world held its breath,” “moving stillness”) is consistent and controlled, though a few phrases recur enough to border on motif-overinsistence. There are no significant clarity problems, scaffold loops, or mixed metaphors. The overall effect is lush but not incoherent, suitable for a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid metaphors, varied syntax, and generally high information density (e.g., “its veins channeling vibrations like secret rivers”). The prose mostly avoids redundancy and keeps momentum through description that also serves worldbuilding. There is a mild tendency toward purple or over-explicit metaphorical restatement in a few sentences, but it does not obscure clarity or dampen the closing image. With slightly tighter pruning of explanatory lines, this would approach elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are precise, layered, and economical for this density of imagery, with very few redundancies. Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful, and key images (“a shape that remembered fire,” “a shingled hush”) are striking and memorable. There is a slight tendency toward stacked abstractions in places, and terms like “boundary-lessly trapped” verge on mannered, but they do not significantly impede clarity or momentum. The final lines land cleanly and recharge earlier motifs without purple muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and efficient, with many sentences doing double duty for image and emotion. Yet there is noticeable repetition and paraphrase—multiple returns to “rust-hued peace,” the loft as cage-then-sanctuary, and reiterated statements about here-and-gone and containment—that could be cut or compressed. A few lines edge into purple or explanatory, especially in the back half, softening momentum and the sharpness of the final cadence. Line-level craft is strong but not fully ruthless, which holds it just below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and a high information density; images usually do double duty for setting and theme (“fragments of overheard stories…cling to my skin like dew”). Repetition of key motifs (“fragments,” “eroded,” “ghost”) reads as intentional pattern rather than scaffolding. There is some risk of metaphor saturation, but vehicles are generally coherent and not mixed, so clarity holds. Line-by-line, very little feels extraneous, though a top-tier venue might push for occasional tightening of abstract phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Line-level craft is generally polished: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty (worldbuilding plus theme). Sensory details (smell of popcorn, rust, the amber glow) ground the more figurative passages. There is some lexicon and image repetition around “flows,” “purpose,” “wonder,” and a few phrases slip into cliché (“beacon of hope,” “stage for dreams”), slightly dulling the impact. The prose is good enough for serious consideration but would benefit from a light prune of abstractions and stock formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong: sentences are generally dense with meaning, the imagery is coherent, and there is little true scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language appears frequently but forms a clear pattern around time, crystal, water, and silence rather than devolving into mixed metaphors. The repeated use of certain phrases (“excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush”) skirts purple but remains purposeful and does not obscure action or closure. Overall momentum is well maintained for a lyric piece, though occasional thematic restatement could be trimmed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and image-rich; many lines do double duty for atmosphere and theme (“each brick a word in a grand lie”). There is some redundancy and mild purple flourishes (“syncopated beat of deceit,” repeated “thoughtfully clear”) that add ornament more than pressure. Still, sentence-level clarity holds, and there are no major loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors that obscure action or closure. Tightening a few abstract or repetitive lines would bring the piece closer to elite line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is line-by-line strong, with high information density—most sentences do double duty with setting, character, and concept. Imagery is vivid and largely coherent (fog as muffler, rope as library, fulgurite as trapped lightning), and rhythm shifts appropriately between descriptive and action beats. There’s some tilt toward ornament (“oceanic hush,” “page written in frost and lantern light”) that occasionally feels a shade too polished and thematically on-the-nose, but it doesn’t obscure sense or drag momentum. Repetition and scaffolding are minimal; nearly every line earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level writing is polished, with strong sensory images and generally efficient sentences carrying multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, character). Some concepts (“lonesome splendor,” “geography of healing,” “projection of presence”) recur with mild abstraction and near-paraphrase, edging toward gentle redundancy. Nonetheless, clarity and momentum within a lyric mode are maintained, and the final image reads cleanly. A slight trim of repeated formulations would lift this into a more rarefied range.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong, with vivid metaphors and multi-purpose sentences that build both texture and world. However, there is noticeable repetition and purple-prose tendency: phrases like “flawed genesis,” “bitterly sweet,” and “quaking reverie” recur, and modifiers sometimes stack in ways that feel ornamental rather than necessary. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar emotional content (the burden/hope balance around the creature’s emergence), slightly dulling impact. Despite this, clarity remains intact and the final image lands cleanly, so the main issue is excess rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and easy to follow, with strong images and mostly effective metaphors (e.g., scars as music, sand as ash). There is some purple tilt and repetition of sentence stems (“She [verb]… She [verb]…”) and conceptual echo (“unyielding compassion,” “she had proven that scars can sing”), which could be trimmed for higher-density impact. Still, clarity remains high, and most sentences carry more than one job (setting, theme, and emotion often overlap). Line-level control is solid, though not yet razor-honed enough for elite competition.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—most lines carry setting, mood, and theme simultaneously—and the syntax flows smoothly. Imagery is vivid and mostly coherent, and there’s minimal scaffolding or obvious loops. That said, figurative language is dense and occasionally overwrought, with some near-redundant phrases and abstract summaries in the closing stretch that slightly dull impact (“her skepticism had not been a shield, but a lantern”). It’s polished and publishable, but could benefit from a light pruning to sharpen the best images and let them breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is generally high: sentences carry multiple functions, rhythm varies, and metaphors are coherent within the established cosmic/computational register. The repeated “Across the quiet sigh of falling petals” functions as a deliberate refrain, not an artifact, and anchors the accumulative structure. There is mild overloading of figurative language and abstractions in some clusters, which slightly blurs moment-to-moment urgency and could be tightened for elite venues. Still, there are no major loops, confusions, or mixed metaphors, and the closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: most lines do double duty for image and theme, and there is little to no scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is generally precise and controlled, with only occasional near-ornament (e.g., a few similes that echo one another in tone) but nothing that muddies sense or momentum. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony and supports the contemplative feel, and key beats are rendered in scene rather than summarized away. The prose stops short of the kind of radical compression or risk that would justify a higher-8 or 9-band score, but it’s clearly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is polished, with high information density—most sentences do at least two jobs (world, mood, theme) without obvious scaffold. A few moments verge on purple or overtly explanatory (“ethically bound,” the final generalization about absolution), but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. Rhythm varies well across long sinuous lines and tighter, hinge-like sentences around decisions. Figurative language is frequent yet largely coherent, maintaining clarity at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is fluent and largely clean, with rich sensory images and consistent rhythm, and it reads smoothly aloud. Yet there is noticeable redundancy and motif overuse—“velveteen gloom” repeats, and “He imagined the weaver’s fingers, calloused yet gentle…” appears twice almost verbatim—creating a sense of loop rather than deliberate refrain. Figurative language is dense and sometimes purely decorative, risking purple prose without always adding new pressure or insight. Tightening repetition and trimming ornamental modifiers would significantly sharpen line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally tight and vivid, with many sentences doing double duty (worldbuilding + character + theme), as in “Her task was not to chart what existed, but to map the vast territory of what might come to be.” Rhythm varies well, and there’s little true scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; most images (cracked black tooth, frost fractures, kingfisher as divining rod) are clear and apt rather than overwrought. A few meta-phrases (“predictive modeling,” “thermal expansion coefficients”) risk sounding expository, but they are integrated into character and world sufficiently to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery (“secret language of light,” “thistled calm,” “cloak of sound”) and generally clean syntax. However, the density of figurative language and repetition of certain images (dust, glow, mist, heartbeat) approaches purple, occasionally flattening impact instead of escalating it. There’s minimal scaffolding or paraphrase looping; most lines do at least two jobs (atmosphere + theme, or image + worldbuilding). Rhythm is smooth, but a touch more variation and restraint would sharpen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, rhythmically varied, and packed with meaningful images, with very few syntactic or logical slips. There is some repetition of concepts (illusion, incompleteness, mirage of safety) and similar structural patterns across sentences, but not enough to seriously drag momentum. A few lines verge on abstraction or paraphrase what the images already show, which slightly dulls impact. Overall, though, the prose carries atmosphere and meaning efficiently for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: most sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, character, and theme), and the imagery is precise rather than florid (“corpse-bloat,” “inscription, worn to ghosts”). There’s minimal redundancy and good momentum despite conceptual density. A few lines drift toward slogan (“His rebellion was rational: evidence over elegy,” “truth was a craft, not a comfort”), which slightly flattens texture into aphorism. Overall, though, clarity, rhythm, and information density are high without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied and musical, images are precise, and most lines do double duty for theme and atmosphere (“They would subtract noise until only one true note remained”). Motifs recur without feeling like loops, and figurative language is controlled and coherent around the negative-space/carving frame. There’s minimal scaffolding or redundancy, and the closing cadence is especially well tuned. A few abstract formulations (“beautiful work of braiding voices into a listening future”) are slightly less concrete, but they don’t materially slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: evocative images, varied syntax, and few wasted sentences. Phrases like “ghost of chlorophyll,” “tea made from the vines she had pruned,” and “a brilliant arc of light stitching the heavens together” carry multiple layers of work. There is some conceptual and lexical repetition (gentle rebellion, synaptic plasticity, memories, beauty from ruins) that edges toward over-insistence, and the lushness occasionally flattens momentum. Still, clarity remains high and the closing image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, rhythmically attentive, and information-dense, with images usually doing double duty for setting and theme. Repetition of honey/amber/light motifs is patterned rather than accidental, culminating in the final tonal payoff. There is some flirtation with purple prose and a few lines that explain what the images already imply, which gently blunts momentum in places. Still, there are no real artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors, and the closure image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains some genuinely lovely lines and a strong sonic consistency, and almost every sentence reinforces mood or motif. Yet there is frequent paraphrase-loop repetition (e.g., multiple near-identical mentions of sanctifying, hushed blaze, shards of hush, houses breathing) that adds bulk without new information. Figurative language is stacked rather than varied, which can blur emphasis and slow momentum in a short form. Overall clarity remains solid, but line-level excess keeps it below elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent: most sentences carry multiple functions (worldbuilding, theme, and emotion) with minimal waste, and the prose flows smoothly despite its density. Metaphor and imagery are mostly precise and coherent with the aquatic/stone/plant palette, and there are few to no true scaffolding or synonym loops. The style leans rich, and a handful of lines (“crushing clarity,” “beautiful, terrible color of possibility”) risk purple repetition of abstract intensifiers, though they do not obscure meaning. Slight trimming of thematic restatements would sharpen momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences are tight, varied, and information-dense, generally doing double duty for worldbuilding and psychology; there’s little obvious scaffolding or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is controlled and legible, with the “corrupted pixel” and “texture of a missed opportunity” motifs earning their keep. The piece leans slightly toward conceptual diction in a couple of lines, which cools the immediacy a bit at peak pressure. Overall, momentum is strong and clarity high, supporting a polished, nearly publishable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, sensuous, and information-dense, often doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. Metaphors (“smog-choked city,” “crushed starlight,” “night-blooming jasmine”) are apt and coherent with the story’s palette. There is some minor repetition of favored images and adjectives (“saffron quiet,” “waxing moon’s glow,” “smog-choked”) and a slight tilt toward purple, but it does not significantly impede clarity or momentum. The prose supports rather than overwhelms the scene, even if it could bear a touch more tightening for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid sensory detail and a good information-to-sentence ratio; most lines do more than one job. Some metaphors and phrases recur a bit too often (“rosewater dread,” “fragile hope,” “last ember of memory turned to ash”), flirting with a faint sense of thematic telling and mild redundancy. Still, syntax varies, clarity holds, and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts that drag momentum or obscure causality. The piece sits at the lush end of lyric but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with high information density—many sentences do double duty for atmosphere and function—and a pleasing sonic quality. Core images (hunger stone, latent radiance, slow exhale of low tide) are vivid and coherent, not muddled. However, the final third drifts toward a summary-string of similarly structured sentences reiterating the same insight, which slightly dulls momentum and sharpness. Some metaphoric repetition flirts with purple but does not significantly obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong: vivid but controlled metaphors (“oily residue,” “corrupted gold,” “bruised twilight”), varied sentence rhythms, and high information density with little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and thematically aligned, so it feels like a designed pattern rather than purple drift. There are minor moments of conceptual repetition around the paradox notes and fear’s weakness, and a couple of thesis-like lines that could be sharpened or pruned for maximum impact. Overall, the prose propels rather than bogs down the narrative and preserves clarity even at peak strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are generally tight, multi-functional, and rhythmically controlled, with vivid but intelligible figurative language. Recurrent terms (“fractal generating,” “sketched resonance,” “restless euphony”) behave as motifs rather than redundant loops, and there are no major clarity issues. There is a mild risk of density tipping toward purple—nearly every sentence carries an image—but the internal logic of those images holds, so momentum isn’t seriously dragged. Minor trims could sharpen impact, but the prose is already close to elite-market-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is tight, image-dense, and largely free of scaffolding or looped restatements; many lines do double duty for worldbuilding and theme (e.g., “reading histories in calcium swirls”). Figurative language—spirals, cracks, sunwashed dread—is coherent and patterned rather than purple, and the rhythm carries momentum through summary and scene. The closing paragraphs lean a bit on abstract nouns (“understanding,” “curiosity”) and explicit thematic articulation, but not enough to blur sense or stall the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean, fluent, and image-rich, with several strong lines (“each rusted rail mirrored a forgotten testimony”). Some conceptual and verbal repetition (“rescue truth from a pit of lies,” repeated formulations of parallels) creates a faint sense of scaffold or slogan rather than fresh progression. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent, and sentences typically do more than one job (setting plus theme, character plus symbol). Information flows clearly, and there are no significant grammatical or rhythmic artifacts undermining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line by line, the prose is polished, economical for its descriptive richness, and largely free of scaffolding or redundancy; most sentences earn their place by carrying multiple functions (worldbuilding, mood, character). Metaphoric language is strong and mostly coherent (“cloud of silt and memory,” “hushed blaze”), with minimal drift into mixed or strained imagery. There is a mild tendency toward stacked abstractions in a few places, but not enough to muddle clarity or slow momentum. Variation in sentence structure and paragraphing supports the accumulative pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clear, syntactically varied, and carry both atmosphere and information. Some phrases and constructions recur a bit too often (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled,” “tranquilly perceptive”), creating a mild sense of lexical loop. Figurative language stays within bounds but occasionally brushes purple, especially when abstractions (stillness, chaos, truth) are reiterated rather than freshly embodied. Momentum holds throughout, and no major artifacts impede comprehension or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level work is strong: sentences are tight, varied, and information-dense, often doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is consistent and largely unmuddled, staying within the glass/light/breath lexicon without collapsing into mixed metaphors. A few phrases recur (“luminous torment,” variants of “recorded dreams”) and the level of ornament is high, but it rarely feels like purple excess or scaffolding. Because momentum remains clear and the closure image is crisp, minor repetition doesn’t materially dull the effect, supporting a high-but-not-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally excellent, with dense, multitasking sentences that braid worldbuilding, emotion, and theme (“energy that pooled like blood in shadows, potential that never got to detonate”). The recurring motifs of geodes, pools, and breakers are handled with care, and the closing images land cleanly. However, there is some accumulation of near-synonymous abstractions (“potential,” “unused energy,” “never-was”) and explicit rephrasing of the core idea that veers toward overwriting. A lighter touch on repeated conceptual language would sharpen the already strong prose and preserve more momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: varied rhythms, high information density, and metaphors that are mostly precise and thematically linked (light/shadow, typeface, frequency). The repetition of certain phrases (“perpetually surprised,” “brilliant dimness”) reads as intentional motif rather than scaffolding. There is mild risk of over-ornamentation—nearly every sentence carries an image or abstraction—but clarity is preserved, and there are no major loops or muddled comparisons that obscure action or closure. Tightening a few near-redundant conceptual statements about belonging and unreadability would make the prose even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished, grammatically clean, and rhythmically varied enough to read smoothly, with many lines doing double duty for image and theme (“driftwood...like broken sentences”). Recurrent images (weight, silence, sieving, broken time) form an intentional pattern rather than random ornament. That said, metaphor density is high and occasionally repetitive (“sieved hush,” “weight of unspoken words,” “weight of a withheld truth”), edging toward purple in places and slipping into mild platitude at the end. There are no serious artifacts or clarity breaks, but a sharper line edit could tighten and defamiliarize some familiar constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, varied, and mostly economical, with imagery doing multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, and character insight). Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and rhythm shifts appropriately between descriptive calm and procedural motion. There is minor tendency toward repeated constructions and a couple of slightly purple or self-conscious phrases (“furrowed hush,” reused), but these do not impede clarity or momentum. Overall, prose would need only light tightening to be publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and mostly purposeful figurative language (e.g., “utility poles were just stars that had lost their ambition”). There are occasional brushes with purple or slightly abstract diction (“backlash of regrets,” “merrily melancholic heart”), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or momentum. Sentences seldom loop or paraphrase; most carry more than one function (setting, theme, and emotion at once). Rhythm at the end tightens effectively around the compass-on-rock and upward gaze images.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and readable, with a good balance of description and motion, and very few syntactic or grammatical distractions. Some phrasing and modifiers repeat (“delicately robust,” “jaded wonder,” “sterile”), and a few sentences double up on similar ideas, creating mild redundancy. Figurative language is present but not so dense as to be purple; it mostly supports atmosphere. With tighter pruning of near-duplicates and more varied rhythms, this could push into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with rhythmic sentences and rich, multi-tasking images (e.g., tears as “tiny moon[s] caught in the orchard’s glow”). Nonetheless, figurative density is high enough that some lines blur into purple repetition of moon/stars/cosmic motifs without always adding new pressure or insight. A few adjacent sentences paraphrase similar emotional content (love transcending form, bond never broken) rather than advancing it. For a top-tier venue, a tighter, more selectively vivid edit would be expected.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is consistently vivid and information-dense, with very few wasted lines; most sentences do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Metaphoric texture is largely coherent (ink, cracks, clouds, tablecloths) and meaningfully recursive rather than random ornament. That said, figurative density is extremely high, and occasional explicit abstractions (“ceremony of breaking,” “accumulation of herself”) plus repeated formulations around “luminous crack” and “repentance” flirt with overwriting. It’s still clearly publishable-level craft, but a slightly leaner line would sharpen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often striking (“edges curled like grief itself,” “stars hung like unanswered prayers”) and information-dense, with many lines doing double duty for worldbuilding and emotion. Metaphor use is frequent but usually controlled; repetition of tears, gravity, and stitching builds pattern rather than purple noise. Some lines veer into overt abstraction or near-platitude, especially at the thematic apex, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp images. Overall, rhythm, clarity, and concision are strong enough for elite venues with only light trimming.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are clear, musical, and information-dense without obvious scaffold or repetition, and the causal chain paragraph is particularly clean and efficient. Figurative language (“fog that glowed with trapped moonlight,” “a constellation of small sacrifices”) is mostly fresh and coherent. There is a touch of purple-prose density in the philosophical lines and some stacked abstractions, but they remain legible and do not blur causality or the closure image. Overall momentum is well-maintained for a reflective piece.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense, with most lines doing double duty for plot and atmosphere. Occasional repeated constructions and favored phrases (“winking hush,” “cradle of sparks”) verge on motif rather than true redundancy and don’t obscure meaning. Figurative language is mostly apt and not overstacked, and there’s little scaffolding or filler. The prose maintains momentum despite being fairly lush.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished, largely free of scaffolding or redundancy, and rich with metaphor and sensory detail; nearly every sentence earns its place in terms of image or atmosphere. Information density is high, with objects and motifs doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, and mood) simultaneously. The main limitation is a tendency toward near-constant figurative language, which risks blurring impact and slightly dulling the central hinge moment by keeping everything at the same lyrical pitch. A bit more modulation—occasional leaner lines at key decisions—would give the strongest images more room to hit.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level work is polished: sentences are generally clear, multi-functional, and free of grammatical noise, with strong verbs and specific imagery doing heavy lifting. The prose sustains a high figurative density (storms as kisses, scars as constellations, timetables as ghost maps) without often tipping into incoherence or mixed metaphor. There is some risk of purple excess through accumulation, but momentum largely holds and there are few if any true paraphrase loops or scaffolding phrases. Tighter pruning of a couple of near-redundant metaphoric beats could make this fully publication-ready at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some pleasing images (sunlight as “kaleidoscope of color”). However, it leans on repetition and stock formulations (“dance of intellect and steel,” “sharp as a rapier,” multiple reuses of “turning questions into destinations”) that blunt impact. Several sentences summarize where dramatization would add force, especially during the duel. Rhythm and variation are adequate, but the line-level doesn’t yet surprise or compress enough to feel truly publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally strong and economical, with many sentences doing double duty for image and theme (e.g., “a quiet network of borrowed books spread through the cells like wildflowers cracking pavement”). There is some repetition of metaphoric frames (seeds, blooming, rust, fractures) that flirts with over-insistence but doesn’t yet tip into muddle. Occasional lines paraphrase existing ideas rather than adding pressure, slightly blunting momentum in the latter third. Rhythm varies enough to keep the piece readable and the final images land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely tight and evocative, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and meaning (e.g., “The station floated above the clouds, a skeletal frame of glass and steel that sang with every gust.”). Recurring phrases (“the horizon invited night,” “steely longing”) function more as motifs than as lazy loops, and there is little true scaffolding or synonym churn. While some metaphors lean toward the familiar or mildly purple (“quiet defiance against the dark”), they rarely blur sense or slow momentum. Line-level craft easily meets high-market standards, even if it doesn’t quite reach the rarefied 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence-level craft is strong: high information density, minimal redundancy, and generally clean, musical syntax. Metaphors and neologisms (“memory-light,” “cartographer’s wings,” “empirically whimsical”) are vivid and mostly coherent, with few if any mixed or clashing images. The prose is rich but not so over-ornamented that it obscures causality or the closure image. There are occasional slightly abstract phrases, yet they don’t significantly slow momentum or blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong: sentences are varied, images are precise, and most metaphors (“light diffused into spectral patterns,” “color… moving through the leaves like tide water”) are clear and thematically apt. Information density is high without major redundancy, and nearly every line does double duty for atmosphere and character. The prose flirts with purple in accumulated figurative language and repeated abstractions like “cerulean regret,” but rarely crosses into muddle or obscurity. There are no noticeable loops, scaffold phrases, or technical errors dulling the closure.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is high, with strong imagery ("wings folded like a discarded map") and controlled rhythm. The score is held back by the tendency to summarize emotional shifts ("She realized," "She watched") rather than letting the image carry the weight, reducing the density of the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with purple descriptors ("luminous echo," "shattered glass," "whisper of wind") and clichés. Repetitive word choices ("quiet" appears six times; "luminous" five times) and awkward prompt insertions ("steadily adaptive," "drifting resonance") disrupt the flow. The sentence structure is repetitive, creating a droning rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive and clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("silently expressive" x2, "unshaken marvels" x3). Reliance on abstract telling verbs ("Mara realized," "She believed") saps the energy from the pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally competent but marred by some "literary" clichés (e.g., "bypassed ears and spoke directly to marrow," "dying heartbeat") and mixed metaphors ("wrinkles of silt"). The use of summary ("Days blurred into weeks") creates a rhythmic lull that saps momentum during the pivotal construction phase.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract telling and repetitive phrasing; the prompt attribute "gently persistent" appears three times as a fixed label. The second half dissolves into summary, stripping the narrative of sensory density and immediate causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is dense with metaphor-salad and therapy-speak ("wound of memory dissolved," "vault of unused love") that obscures clarity. Repetitive sentence structures (Noun [verb]... / She [verb]...) create a monotonous rhythm lacking propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is vivid, but the repetition of specific phrases ("texture of time" appears three times; "quaking reverie" twice) becomes a distracting artifact. While the geometric imagery is sharp, it is occasionally undercut by purple descriptors that soften the hard sci-fi/fantasy edge.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("bruised sky," "heart a steady drum") and filter verbs ("He knows," "He imagines"). Metaphors are often mixed or abstract ("mind a calm ocean," "chains... are a map"), cluttering the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is lush and atmospheric ("drifting like snow through the nutrient bath"), but occasionally relies on filter verbs ("She heard," "She understood") that distance the reader. The transition "suddenly she heard it" is mechanically weak for such a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.0)
    Severe repetitive strain destroys prose quality: "luminous disbelief" appears four times, "illuminated moments" five times, and "destiny's door" four times in a short text. The prose is laden with adjectival clutter ("emerald," "golden," "silver") that obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and rhythmic ("creased like the palm of a hand"), but occasional lapses into abstractions or clichés ("rusted bolts of old resolve," "weighty lightness") mar the otherwise high-density writing. The "collective heart" line feels slightly overwrought compared to the sharper, more grounded imagery of the silica and the kiln.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on clichés ("red like predatory eyes") and repetitive descriptors ("rusted," "trembling"). The density comes from abstract metaphors rather than concrete, propulsive action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.2)
    Line-level craft fails due to extreme repetition of "text artifacts." The phrase "ambered hush" appears over 10 times, and "marbled hush" and "pebble-shore oracle" are similarly overused. This synonym churn and phrase looping obscures imagery and halts momentum, triggering maximum artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is competent but occasionally overwrought with adjectival clusters ("bruised purple," "spectral ribbons"). There is a noticeable repetitiveness in sentence openers ("J-3's optical sensors," "J-3's programming," "J-3's processors"), creating a mechanical rhythm that dulls the momentum. The word "amalgamate" is repeated three times in quick succession, drawing attention to itself as a prompt insertion rather than a natural lexical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose relies on abstract summary and mixed metaphors ("thaw mistrust," "silent freeze") rather than concrete imagery. The phrase "ambiguously clear" is a distracting oxymoron that undermines clarity, and the frequent use of "resonant hush" becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter ("wisely pragmatic precision") and forced prompt insertions that break syntactic flow. The phrase "blooming withering" is used clumsily as a descriptor, creating nonsensical imagery ("hues of blooming withering") that obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("petals made of twisted spacetime"). However, the repetition of specific prompt phrases like "mechanically warm" (three times) and "hush of beating wings at rest" (twice verbatim) feels slightly mechanical and creates a scaffolded effect that draws attention to the prompt constraints rather than the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("in between spaces" x6, "lately inspired" x3) creates a severe scaffold effect that destroys rhythm. Syntax breaks around insertions ("watching as the water damage creating images revealed itself"), resulting in clumsy, unpolished line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition artifacts damage the prose; "swallowed truth" appears six times, "auroral sorrow" four times, and "swaying certainties" three times in a short text. The prose is heavy with "purple" descriptors and abstract nouns, lacking the concrete density required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from verbatim repetition ("drowsy alertness" in opening and closing) and over-reliance on the stem "appraise" (five uses). These artifacts clutter the text and distract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text loop artifacts mar the prose, with phrases like "drift of untold seasons" and "regenerative silence" repeated four times each. Adjective stacking ("fragile peace," "overgrown library") reduces density and momentum. These repetitions read as template cadence rather than purposeful motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is weighed down by adjectival clutter ("amber twilight," "unhurried gait") and cliché ("measured time in breaths"). The verbatim repetition of "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" three times creates a significant loop artifact that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, but marred by the repetitive, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("sensitively perceptive" appears twice; "stories walls have heard" twice) which creates a scaffolded feel. Some sentences are overburdened with explanatory clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery ("guilty stars," "heartbeat of glass and brass") that avoids cliché. The sentences have strong rhythmic propulsion, and the integration of the "musical/orchestration" metaphor into the descriptions is handled with sophisticated craft.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled with high density. Some phrasing verges on the overwrought ("stones remembered every possible rain," "decorated into submission"), but the style generally supports the tone without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant loop artifacts mar the climax, with the phrase "She had become the conductor of unheard symphonies" appearing three times and "upturned hush" stuttering across adjacent sentences ("The hush had been upturned... The upturned hush"). These repetitions stall momentum at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The phrase "procedural generation" repeats six times, acting as a scaffold artifact that disrupts the prose rhythm. The line-level writing relies heavily on abstract noun phrases ("territory of consciousness," "knot of being") that reduce immediacy and physical momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("tears streaming," "thaw after eternal winter," "whispering secrets," "bridge not a barrier"). The reliance on abstract metaphors over concrete sensory specifics dulls the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is marred by redundant phrasing ("proceed by progressing laterally") and significant repetition of the word "layered" ("layered tranquility" twice, "layered smile"). The insertion of the phrase "after being followed home" in the middle of a paragraph reads like a clumsy prompt check that disrupts narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is functional but marred by clunky modifiers ("aromatically cautious") and cliché constructions ("ghosts of..."). The prose rhythm is somewhat monotonous, and the heavy-handed thematic statements at the end reduce the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple" overwriting and clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") that disrupt the rhythm. Repetitive sentence structures and abstract mixed metaphors ("texture of time," "ripples," "mirages") obscure clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe template cadence artifacts ("She collects... She arranges... She places...") and repetitive sentence openers stall momentum and create a drone-like rhythm. Cliché density is high ("wake the dead," "living, breathing presence"), and filter verbs ("She feels," "She sees") distance the reader from immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally evocative ("honeyed light," "resinous scent"), but the excessive repetition of "half truths" (5x) and "fuse insight with empathy" (3x) constitutes a significant text artifact. These loops distract from the otherwise solid imagery and create a robotic, prompt-driven undertone that lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant "telling" and summary artifacts, skipping over the moments that require scene-level density. Clichés abound ("weathered hands," "grizzled veteran"). The forced repetition of the prompt phrase "cautious exuberance" and the thematic label "cycles of compassion" disrupts the flow and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("tears speaking dialects," "sorrow a glass wall") that abstracts action and reduces clarity. While the rhythm is controlled, the reliance on "purple" descriptors ("luminescent ache") and abstract similes ("like a remembering") creates an artifact of overwriting that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rich in imagery ("liquid lead," "petrified feather"), though it occasionally leans into density that slows momentum. Sentence structures in the middle section become slightly repetitive with subject-verb openers, but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is often overwrought and heavy with abstract metaphor ("turned silver droplets into silent music," "constellations of meaning"). This density obscures the literal action, and the repetition of modifiers ("gentle, inventive") creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("brittle ribbon whispered against her thumb"). However, the repetition of specific phrases ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical") draws attention to them as inserted artifacts rather than organic descriptions. The density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft is otherwise competent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract noun-adjective pairings ("quiet desire," "reluctant metamorphosis," "fragile resilience," "gentle chaos") that create a dense, "purple" texture without specific imagery. Paraphrase loops repeat the central concept of letting go without advancing the narrative or deepening the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prompt phrases ("haggard awe," "wryly earnest") are repeated verbatim multiple times, creating jarring mechanical artifacts. The prose leans heavily on purple abstractions and "telling," which dilutes narrative density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "overlapping shadows" appears six times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. Other prompt phrases ("bright darkness," "everyday magic") are repeated three times each, causing the text to read mechanically rather than flowing naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished and dense, but the phrase "reactively visionary" is clumsy and abstract, standing out as a likely forced insertion. Additionally, metaphors like "bottled starlight" read as generic placeholders in a piece that otherwise demonstrates specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant line-level issues block high-band entry. High adverb density ("suddenly," "specifically," "absolutely," "permanently") weakens the verbs. The phrase "fog rolled thick as cotton" is a tired cliché that breaks immersion. The prose tells ("impossible summons") more than it shows.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of abstract phrases (&quot;unheard symphony&quot; appears six times; &quot;courageously kind&quot; three times) flattens the prose texture. The reliance on purple abstractions (&quot;sculpt space for reflection,&quot; &quot;entangled memories&quot;) results in low information density and a lack of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is consistently overwrought, suffering from a heavy reliance on adjective-noun stacking ("irradiated hunger," "invisible serpents," "magnetic screams," "lifeless perfection") that creates a dense, purple texture. This pervasive modification slows the pacing and distances the reader, obscuring the action behind a layer of ornamentation. A rigorous edit to strip the modifiers would significantly improve immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and forced prompt integration; phrases like "breach of pure geometry" and "hum its deathly vitality" read as awkward and pretentious. Abstract metaphors frequently clutter the sentence level, obscuring physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe template cadence issues stifle the prose; nearly every sentence follows a "She [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" structure (Anaphora loop), creating a monotonous list-like rhythm. This structural repetition acts as a major text artifact that drains momentum and obscures the "textures" the story aims to describe.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose features high density and strong imagery ("metal filing cabinets slamming shut"), but relies on scaffold sentences ("The motivation is simple," "He decides") to bridge beats. These artifacts tell the internal shift rather than dramatizing it through the established imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is dense with metaphor ("words reshaping themselves like clouds," "rust open like a broken skull"), occasionally veering into purple territory. Rhythmically, the piece suffers from a repetitive subject-verb sentence structure ("He [verb]...", "The [noun] [verb]...") that creates a monotonous cadence. The high density of figurative language sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and "tell" constructions ("smelled of turpentine and hope," "living, breathing organism"). Metaphors are often mixed or decorative ("lights dancing... like fireflies on a liquid sky"), and the rhythm is repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.7)
    Line-level craft is severely hampered by the triple repetition of the phrases "purposefully curious" and "dawning hush," creating a distracting text artifact. While grammar is clean, the reliance on stated emotion ("filled with a dawnlit melancholy") and cliché metaphors ("fingers toward the east") flattens the prose impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies on "workshop purple" clichés ("symphony of metal," "forgotten promise," "prayer whispered") that soften specificity. While rhythmically competent, the reliance on standard emotive metaphors prevents the imagery from feeling fresh or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is burdened by forced similes ("dry wit emerging like frost on iron") and prompt-phrase insertions that break immersion. The recurrence of writing/grammar metaphors for physical objects (comma, page, sentence) becomes repetitive and self-conscious, and the tell-heavy style dampens the immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Usage errors ("begging question" for a question demanding an answer) and cliché similes ("moss... like old blood") mar the surface. The explicit scaffold "The method worked like this:" marks a failure to dramatize the mechanism, resulting in a lecture mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally functional but marred by significant clichés ("Instinct screamed," "Tell them it was beautiful"). The ending relies on rhetorical loops ("understood, without understanding") that reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe keyword looping destroys the prose rhythm; "copperlight repose" appears 5 times, "impossible/impossibilities" 6 times, and "hush" over 10 times in a short space. This redundancy reads like algorithmic keyword stuffing and prevents any sense of flow or progression.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of stock phrases ("winter-cracked fields" appears three times; "lovingly venomous" twice) and tautologies ("appearing in ephemeral cameo appearances"). These distinct artifacts and the reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("silent testament," "ancient tinctures") reduce density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés and purple imagery ("ghost-light in the gloom," "sun rose like a pale orchid") that obscures clarity and creates a generic texture. Repeated sentence structures and abstract nouns create a lulling, summary-like rhythm devoid of tension or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and abstraction, exemplified by phrases like "smelled of moss and memory" and "quiet tremor of faith." High-density metaphor use ("fragile ember," "shadows lengthening") feels decorative and slows momentum without adding concrete sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("painted... in sepia tones," "anonymity's final signature") and clichés ("surgical precision"). The density of metaphorical language ("fossil of commerce," "frayed like forgotten flags") occasionally slows momentum without adding necessary precision to the action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is heavily burdened by stock phrases and modifiers ("whispered secrets," "silence hung," "corridors of power," "beacon in the dark," "dark constellation"). This reliance on cliché flattens the imagery and reduces the impact of the more original "cobalt observatory" concept. "Echoed silence" is repeated three times, diminishing its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and repetitive sentence structures, particularly the pairing of concrete objects with abstract concepts ("ink and grief," "salt and sorrow"). The phrase "fierce tenderness" is used twice in close proximity, creating a lexical loop that distracts from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("riptide," "dissolves," "weep," "swim") borders on congestion. The imagery is strong, but a few metaphors feel stacked rather than integrated, slowing the initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy use of filter verbs ("She felt," "She spotted," "She realized," "She knew") creates distance. Metaphors are often mixed or scientifically jarring ("spraying photons like watercolor"). Lexical repetition ("joy," "pulse," "light") becomes fatiguing, and the prose leans on abstract nouns over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases constitutes a major line-level flaw; "methodically playful" appears four times and "pause between question and reply" five times, creating a distinct "scaffold" artifact. The prose relies on telling over showing ("bewitched," "symphony of awakenings"), and these loops actively degrade the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("voice like a steel trap," "spark of defiance") and heavy scaffolds ("To outsiders... to Aris..."). Repetitive phrasing around the "candidly cryptic" attribute reduces the sharpness of the line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is dense with ornamental metaphors ("soften like kelp," "thread spun from moonlight") that border on purple. Sentence structures are repetitive and often rely on "telling" constructions ("She interpreted this as...", "Her motivation was...") that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose suffers significantly from forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements (e.g., "moved gently systematic," "wind chime bamboo tube cracked"), resulting in grammatical awkwardness. The text is dense with mixed metaphors and repetitive sentence structures that stifle momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    The phrase "symphonies of truth" appears five times, turning a poetic image into a repetitive label. The prose also suffers from "telling" summaries, particularly in the final paragraph, which flattens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    Line-level execution is marred by melodramatic descriptors ("scarred," "throbbed," "groan") and the strained logic of the adhesive analysis scene. The prompt insertions stick out as textual artifacts, creating friction in readability and breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.1)
    Significant lexical fatigue: "fragile" appears four times, "echo" six times, and "song/sung" over ten times. Sentence structures are repetitive (Subject-Verb starts: "Elias released," "He balanced," "He counted"), creating a monotone rhythm that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely marred by the mechanical repetition of full prompt phrases ("pilot logbook weather code" appears six times in a short space). This creates a "fill-in-the-blanks" artifact effect that destroys immersion and flow, and the density of abstract nouns weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("dying leviathan," "breathing shadow," "geometry ghosts") that occasionally obscures clarity. The usage of "softly ingenious" to describe a feather is a semantic category error that breaks immersion, and the text relies heavily on filter verbs ("Iyana knew," "Iyana felt").

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies heavily on telling and oxymoronic labeling ("cheerful gloom," "sweet sorrow") instead of evoking these states through image and action. Causality is weakened by convenient phrasing ("Lira conjectured," "She had learned"), and the density of meaningful detail is low.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally evocative, but the required attribute "lightly attentive" is repeated three times in short succession, creating a distracting lexical artifact. These repetitions break the rhythm and feel like a checklist rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwrought and heavily dependent on adjective-noun pairings ("lunar resonance," "cosmic verse," "obsidian grace") that obscure clarity. Prompt phrases like "spontaneous anchor" are inserted as clunky noun phrases that disrupt the rhythm. The density of abstract metaphors ("silences as ink," "shadows as parchment") results in a lack of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and mixed metaphors ("heart a tempered pane," "soul's hidden ledgers"). Significant repetition of key phrases ("before everything shifts," "noctilucent reckonings," "prism atrium") creates a mechanical, template-like cadence. These text artifacts distract from the imagery and suggest a checklist approach to the prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract nouns and metaphors ("hard softness," "gently skilled," "cradling a cracked porcelain box as delicate as the memories"). Several required elements are shoehorned in as awkward phrases ("reflected deeply," "slow dance of celestial bodies"), creating rhythm bumps and "purple" artifacts that clutter the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is often striking, but the prose suffers from the forced repetition of prompt phrases which disrupts the rhythm. The required phrase "creating patterns with decorations" is syntactically awkward and reads as a scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by extreme repetitive phrasing; "sensitively perceptive" appears five times, "film negative strip" five times, and "half-burned diaries" four times in a short space. These text artifacts act as scaffolding that was never removed, obscuring the otherwise competent grammar and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; "borrowed heartbeat" appears eight times and "dusky harmony" five times, creating a relentless synonym loop that stalls momentum and obscures the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by purple descriptions ("clung to the hillside like a forgotten promise," "kissed its edges") and abstract metaphors ("mosaic of hope"). Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("believed," "knew," "realized," "understood") distances the reader from the immediate action. Paraphrase loops occur where the narrative restates the character's internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is overwritten with adjective-heavy modification ("fragile promise," "ghostly melody") that slows momentum. The shift to summary telling in the final third drains density and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacting, with the phrase "between sigh and smile" and "alarming serenity" each appearing three times in a short space, creating a mechanical rhythm. The reliance on abstract metaphors ("spaces between notes," "threads of sound") obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and atmospherically dense, though it leans into repetitive stylistic artifacts ("un-died, un-betrayed, un-lived"). The rhythm is generally strong, but the reliance on the "un-" prefix becomes a noticeable scaffold, and the phrase "meteor hush" is reused to diminishing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.9)
    While individual images are strong, the prose suffers severely from patterned artifacts. Key phrases ("blushing stillness," "temporary structures as signals," "interrupted cadence") are repeated verbatim multiple times in short succession, creating a distractingly artificial loop. This redundancy, combined with the "Thematic Echo" in the final third, significantly undermines the literary polish and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant text artifacts drag the score down; specific phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") are repeated three times each in a short space, creating a loop/scaffold effect. The prose tends toward purple descriptors that clutter the imagery rather than clarifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally high-quality but suffers from forced prompt integration; "precisely playful" appears repetitively and clunkily, and the final sentence ("precisely nothing and playfully everything") drifts into vague rhetoric. Imagery is often strong ("thumbnail grown brittle," "fox stamp"), but the climax leans on abstract summary rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally polished, but the forced insertion of required phrases ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") creates awkward rhythmic stumbles. The repetition of "dusky harmony" and "frugal/frugality" feels mechanical rather than motivic.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from cliché ("silence could be a weapon sharper than any blade") and heavy abstraction ("mosaic of every grudge," "helices of her phantom DNA"). While the rhythm is controlled, the reliance on somatic melodrama ("vibration Mira felt in her teeth") and abstract nouns reduces the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "purple" excesses like "instrument's grief" and "glacier's memory," which blur clarity for the sake of mood. Physics and craft logic are glossed over (grinding frost-sand into mirrors), which undermines the "grounded artisan" premise. The density of similes slows momentum and distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished and readable, though it leans on similes that feel slightly constructed ("tongue as sharp as her chisels"). The forced insertion of the prompt phrase "endearingly feisty" disrupts the natural rhythm of the character description.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished but relies on some generic phrasings ("shattered symmetries," "simultaneously beautiful and terrible") that dilute the imagery. The repetition of the exact prompt phrases (e.g., "nonlinear inheritance" appears three times) feels slightly mechanical and acts as scaffolding rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive phrasing damages the prose; the phrase "unheard symphony" appears eight times, creating a distracting loop. The writing suffers from "adjective-noun" overloading and lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by high modifier density and the repetitive use of prompt phrases as static labels. The rhythm is often stalled by explanatory metaphors in the middle of active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The phrase "warmly methodical" is repeated three times in a short text, creating a distracting lexical loop. Some metaphors are overwrought ("defusing a semantic bomb where the wires were stories"), cluttering the prose and obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe lexical repetition mars the prose; specific phrases like "echo chamber stone" (7 uses), "bloom of hush" (6 uses), and "hammered repose" (5 uses) create a mechanical, copy-paste rhythm. The sentence structure is frequently monotonous, often starting with the subject, which drags the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought, drifting into purple territory with phrases like "thistle blown by hope's improbable breath," which strains metaphor logic. While there are no major mechanical errors, the density of abstract imagery sometimes obscures the literal action, favoring poetic sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "summer-quill archivist," "deepening hush" repeated verbatim). The "preemptively nostalgic" phrasing feels clunky and inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose relies heavily on stock imagery and adjective-noun pairings ("gravity of hopelessness," "thick as tar," "coiled spring," "defiant anthem"). Phrases like "listened with ambient awareness" feel like inserted jargon rather than organic description. The density of similes ("like celebratory garlands," "like a coiled spring") clutters the rhythm and dulls the impact of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is dense with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("silence that had swallowed," "stone breath syncing"). The reliance on stock imagery ("liquid silver") and abstract nouns ("cadence," "texture," "essence") reduces clarity and impact. Sentences often loop conceptually without advancing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is heavily marred by template cadence; nearly every sentence in the middle section follows a "Subject-Verb" structure ("She climbed," "She held," "She tasted," "She slipped"). Mixed metaphors ("humming with a silence that seemed to sprout") and oxymorons ("intangibly tangible") clutter clarity without adding depth.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is generally competent, the insertion of the required phrase "moved fluidly logical through her calculations" creates a jarring grammatical artifact (adjective modifying a verb path). Additionally, phrases like "vaulting hush" and "crystalline feathers" push toward purple prose, occasionally prioritizing ornamentation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("peel of paint layers") and cliché ("heartbeat of forgotten kings"). The phrase "began to sally forth" is a stilted construction that breaks the rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("loaded emptiness" x3, "doorknocker ring" x4, "fading threshold" x4, "burn bridges" x4) creates a mechanical scaffold that strangles prose flow. Metaphors are often mixed or abstract ("edges blurring like a breath"), and the density of "telling" is high.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is polished and readable, though occasionally overwrought with adjective-heavy descriptions ("glitchy," "faint," "soft blue"). Metaphors often feel decorative ("dying star") rather than structurally integrated into the POV's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe loop artifacts dominate the prose; specific phrases ("golden shadows," "first yawn," "bridge of intuition") are repeated excessively, shattering immersion. Sentence structures are repetitive and template-like, lacking variety or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive looping; specific phrases ("shivering bliss," "shape of possibility," "unsnap") are repeated three to four times in a short space, creating a mechanical rhythm. The integration of required phrases like "factually mystical truth" is clumsy and disrupts the sentence flow.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is competent but marred by filter verbs ("she noticed," "she found") and the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases like "tactfully hopeful." The reliance on "to be" verbs in descriptive passages slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("dying stars," "worst possible moments") and clunky clarifications ("literally, a new security feature"). Figurative language often obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe text-artifact penalty applied for extreme repetition of specific phrases ("vested hush" ~7x, "quietly vivid" ~4x, "eerie nostalgia" ~4x, "prism atrium in mist" ~4x). These loops create a robotic cadence that obstructs flow and destroys immersion. The prose relies on oxymorons and abstract nouns over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from "purple" descriptions ("pulsing like a heartbeat of the sky") and cliché ("moves with grace"). The forced phrasing "emerges transformed always" creates a grammatical stumble, and the repetition of "tiny monuments" and "hush" indicates a lack of line-level editing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished with high image density ("mineral deposits... like frozen tears"). Line-level craft is solid, though occasionally veers into purple territory to accommodate the required emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    The word "weight" appears eight times, and phrases like "luminous regret" and "factually mystical" are repeated verbatim, creating a distracting scaffold that reduces information density. These unintended echoes clutter the prose and suggest a need for tighter line-level editing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    High-density prose with strong sonic imagery ("sob turning inside-out"). A few phrases lean toward the ornamental ("arterial gold," "luminous ache"), but the line-level propulsion is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.0)
    Lexical loops ("braced herself," "braced again," "braced once more") and template cadence ("Each footfall," "each heartbeat," "each breath") create a repetitive rhythm. The word "mercy" and "formula/ratio" metaphors are overused to the point of semantic satiation, and abstract nouns clutter the sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("eternal instant," "elusively tangible," "between childhood and now" appear three times each) creates a mechanical, droning rhythm that exposes the scaffolding. The prose is dense with abstract metaphors that blur the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by minor repetitions ("accumulation," "impossible") and some slightly purple abstractions ("structural grief"). The visual descriptions are dense and effective, but the final paragraph leans too heavily on explaining the metaphor rather than letting the image of the cracks and the spring do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose features strong, lucid imagery ("smoke made of memory," "fractal script"), but suffers from noticeable repetition artifacts. The phrase "swirling sea of clouds" appears verbatim in both the opening and the climax, and the overuse of "negotiable" distracts from the otherwise high polish.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose leans toward "purple" descriptors ("gilded skull," "ghostlight," "maelstrom of visible seconds") that clutter the imagery. There are repetitive phrasing artifacts, notably the verbatim reuse of the prompt phrase "burnished sorrow" and the descriptor "visible" (waves, time, seconds, sunset). The density of metaphor occasionally obscures the physical action of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is lush and generally effective, though it occasionally lapses into overwrought metaphors ("malignant flower," "covenant... screamed") that threaten clarity. The rhythm is good, but phrases like "symphony of tinkersong wonder" feel slightly tautological and self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but frequently overwrought ("scent of endings," "silence that owned"). The reliance on "telling" metaphors—"hinged awakening," "permission"—distances the reader from the visceral reality of the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from redundancy ("hummed their turbine-hum") and the awkward insertion of abstract noun phrases ("perpetually learning nature") that disrupt rhythm. Key phrases appear to be shoehorned in verbatim, leading to grammatical stiffness ("The perpetually learning never stopped") and telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of the word "quiet" (used 13 times as a modifier), creating a distracting text artifact that flattens the rhythm. Vocabulary loops ("whisper," "silver") and purple phrasing ("shadows seemed to breathe," "exhale a soft perfume") undermine the clarity and precision required for this tier. The density of adjectives slows momentum without adding distinct information.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("arranging beach debris as messages" x3, "searing reverie" x3, "floating library on a zeppelin" x2) marks this as a scaffolded response rather than crafted prose. These repetitive artifacts clog the narrative and destroy immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose relies on repetitive Subject-Verb sentence openers ("Kael spent," "He refused," "He imagined") that create a monotone rhythm. Abstract phrasing ("tapestry of possibilities") and summary narration dilute the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lexical repetition undermines the prose; the word "velvet" appears three times in metaphorical phrases alongside the tautological "quiet disquiet," creating a distinct loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.7)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("furious tranquility" and "wild serenity" appear four times each), creating a mechanical cadence. The phrase "decrease entropy" introduces a jarring scientific register clash within the fantasy tone. The meta-narrative conclusion ("The story ends") is a significant artifact that breaks the fictional dream.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is rhythmic and polished but leans toward the ornate ("plastic promise of surety," "wind's confession"). The verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "credibly curious" in the final line creates a jarring, artificial echo.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("silken shroud," "sigh of cooling metal," "tapestry of hope," "life finds a way") and repetitive phrasing. The required element phrases ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") are inserted clumsily as explicit labels multiple times. The writing relies on abstract nouns and adjectives rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=1.2)
    Severe repetitive artifacts render the prose unpublishable; key phrases ("mute eloquence," "tangled covenant," "tranquilly perceptive") are repeated 3–5 times each in a short space. The prose tells rather than shows ("Through contextual clues she sensed..."), violating basic craft standards.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery ("ink in water," "between noon and memory") is balanced by occasional filter verbs ("Elara recognized"). Line-level momentum is generally solid, though some similes feel decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.7)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("burnished hush" x5, "woven dawns" x4, "incomplete" x6) triggers the artifact penalty; the object permanence failure with the feather undermines basic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    Major repetitive flaws lower the score: "Stone warmed... gentle systematic pulse" and "Oak leaves whispered: patience, gratitude, continue" appear twice almost verbatim. The phrase "gently systematic" is overused (4+ times) to the point of becoming a distracting text artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts, specifically the phrases &quot;luminous skeptic,&quot; &quot;bronze quiet,&quot; and &quot;academically rebellious,&quot; which appear multiple times in a short text. Sentence structures are repetitive (&quot;She followed...&quot; &quot;She believed...&quot; &quot;She knelt...&quot;), creating a plodding rhythm. The density is lowered by reliance on heavy modification rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetitive phrasing ("narrow vastness" appears four times; "submerged concord" three times; "rickety" twice) and clichés ("dust of a thousand battles") mark the prose as unpolished. These artifacts distract significantly from the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but the forced insertion of the prompt phrase ("His mind worked intuitively descriptive") creates a grammatical stumble. Some metaphors, like "reading Braille with his eardrums," border on the overwrought and mix sensory domains confusingly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from clichés ("tomb of steel," "empty cathedral") and logical contradictions (sketching in a vacuum). Repetitive phrasing around "silence" stalls momentum, and the "turning" of a sewn applique reveals a lack of attention to physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of full noun phrases ("pocket sundial lid" appears five times; "sacredly playful" and "chivalrous thief" three times each) creates a distracting, drumbeat effect. The prose leans on adjective-heavy abstraction ("cautious abandon," "frozen starlight") instead of concrete, active verbs, reducing information density.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetition of specific prompt phrases ("luminous absence" x4, "small gestures" x5, "nomadic penumbra" x3) creates a distracting echo effect in such a short space. These lexical loops read as checklist-driven rather than organic, severely hampering the prose's freshness and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from cliché and inert phrasing ("soft as silk," "thrummed beneath her ribs," "forgotten chapter of her life"). Adjective-noun pairings often feel decorative ("pale silver light," "ghostly shimmer") rather than precise. The line-level density is lowered by explanatory bridges that summarize significance instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and forced prompt integration, particularly the clunky adverbial construction "fidget productively" and the mixed metaphors surrounding the "woven hush." The text frequently tells the reader how to feel via filter verbs ("He realized," "He could almost feel") rather than showing the sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is readable but marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("innocently mischievous," "forged hush") and abstract nouns. The reliance on explaining emotional states ("exhale possibilities instead of penance") weakens the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose has strong rhythm and high density, but leans toward "purple" abstraction and sentimental phrasing ("eroded into geometry," "something like hope," "scars singing the truth"). While evocative, these metaphorical flourishes occasionally obscure the immediate physical reality and act as a filter between reader and action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is saturated with "purple" descriptors and mixed metaphors ("spiderweb of silver racing," "dark mouth promising secrets"). Key phrases from the prompt are shoehorned in awkwardly ("intimately aloof" used as a label). The rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on abstract nouns ("eternity," "confession," "promise") creates a barrier to clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic ("voice became just another kind of silence"), though occasionally dense with adjectives. The phrasing "scream of his tenderness" is a bit awkward syntactically, likely forced by the prompt, but the overall texture is high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés and mixed metaphors ("tears carved rivers," "silent scream," "swallowed... whole"). These artifacts obscure clarity and reduce emotional impact to stock phrasing. The heavy use of abstract labels ("raw solace," "patchwork navigator") weakens specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("taste of truth," "splinter I could not swallow") and clichés ("glinting like a forgotten promise," "inner turmoil"). Frequent repetition of prompt terms ("occlude," "psychological safety") creates mechanical rhythm and artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by a severe repetitive artifact: the phrase "softly persistent" appears five times in a short text, creating a distracting loop. Additionally, the writing leans toward overwrought metaphors ("trembling shadows," "silent testament") that reduce clarity and narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is generally strong ("ghosting in the dark," "petrichor and time"), but the prose is marred by prompt-phrase artifacting, specifically the threefold repetition of "empirically intuitive." Additionally, some adjective-heavy constructions like "impossible phosphorescence" lean toward purple prose, slightly reducing the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("bleeding starlight" appears five times; "lace/lacy" and "softly commanding" repeat) creates a distracting echo effect. The prose leans heavily towards adjectival density ("silver wounds," "dangerous lace") over propulsive verb usage, resulting in a static, overwrought texture that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwritten, prioritizing abstract metaphors ("threads of liquid light," "palette of resolve") over concrete grounding. There is a tendency toward "telling" via noun phrases ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity") rather than showing through specific action. The density of adjectives and figurative language slows the pace without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from excessive metaphor density ("bored oracle," "thirsty ghost," "mountain range of when," "jaw of earth"), which clogs narrative momentum. A typo ("symbols a anchor") and the relentless figurative language obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is polished but frequently overwrought, relying on dense similes ("bled into each other like watercolors") and abstract phrasing ("liquid heartbeat") that slows momentum. There is a tendency to explain the subtext immediately after showing it, reducing the impact of the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.8)
    The text suffers from significant repetitive artifacts, specifically the phrase "saturated hush," which appears four times in a short span, creating a noticeable loop. The word "breath" and its variations are also overused (approx. 8 times), creating a redundant cadence that drags on the momentum. The prose relies on abstract telling ("Her motivation was to...") rather than showing through action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is competent but leans into "purple" descriptors and clichés ("skepticism warring with a flicker of hope"). The text explicitly labels its own tone ("ethereal grit") and relies on adjective-heavy phrasing ("hollow percussion") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from density issues and "purple" phrasing ("silence a scream wrapped in resounding hush," "entropy's yawn"). While rhythmically competent, the reliance on adjectival metaphors creates a layer of abstraction that distances the reader from the action. The prompt phrase "wanderingly exact" is integrated grammatically but feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("razor edges" appears ~9 times, "counting backwards" ~6 times) creates a distracting echo chamber that ruins prose rhythm. These text artifacts feel like unedited looping rather than intentional stylistic patterning, significantly degrading the reading experience and obscuring the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lexical repetition harms the prose quality significantly; "spatially gifted" appears three times as a fixed epithet, and "quiet wildfire" and "familiar stranger" are reused noticeably. These loops create a template-like feel that detracts from the otherwise smooth sentence-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is often overwrought ("pulse of a gambler's heart still beating in the walls") and suffers from repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openers). The phrase "clover-melancholy" appears forced, disrupting the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("broken record," "thread of connection," "wax near flame," "door at dawn"). These artifacts obscure the imagery and reduce the narrative to a series of familiar tropes rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts ("proximate cause" is used three times in identical template phrases). Clunky puns ("steep of the tea/hillside") and diagnostic labels degrade the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose is grammatically competent but leans heavily on purple abstraction ("harmonious resonance," "gentle rebellion") and cliché ("vanished with the dawn"). Specific prompt phrases are inserted as adjectives or labels rather than integrated into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.0)
    While polished, the prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("language of shivers," "language of the stillpoint," "language of stillness"). The phrase "quiet blaze" appears four times, becoming a distracted text artifact rather than a resonant motif. These repetitions reduce the density and impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from metaphor overload ("light bent into whispered spirals," "time pooled like honey") and abstract sensory details ("tasted of old regret"). There are repetitive sentence structures ("He [verb]... He [verb]...") that create a monotonous cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract metaphors and filter verbs ("Elias felt," "Elias understood") instead of concrete imagery. Phrasing like "joyful sorrow" and "nowhere and everywhere" leans on cliché rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but overwrought in places ("volcanic tenderness erupted," "memory... like guilt"). The density is diluted by summary telling, and the "analytically intuitive" phrase is a tell-y artifact that shortcuts description.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is generally evocative, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "quietly rebellious" (lines 7 and 22) acts as a distracting loop. Additionally, the refrain "hush of the universe inhaling" appears three times in a short space; while likely intended as a lyric anchor, it feels slightly heavy-handed and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clear but marred by "explainer" sentences ("The key... was a tuning fork in disguise") and abstract labels ("calculated spontaneity"). Some jargon ("harmonic node") clutters the description without adding sensory clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetitive vocabulary weakens the prose; the word "silent" appears ten times, flattening the rhythm. Clichés like "bruised sky" and awkward adverbs ("spiralingly") disrupt the line-level quality. The prose feels padded with adjectives rather than driven by verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose suffers from clichéd phrasing ("mist hung heavy," "forgotten tome") and repetitive metaphors ("forests of second thoughts" appears three times). The reliance on abstract labels over concrete action dilutes the line-level impact and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is readable and rhythmically competent but suffers from filtering ("Mira knew," "She felt") that dulls immediacy. Several lines rely on cliché phrasing ("unlock guarded hearts," "shed like old skin") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés and abstract metaphors ("grief pooled like dark water," "blank slate," "bare canvas," "silent confessions"). The reliance on "would" constructions for the climax creates a passive filter, and the text frequently explains the meaning of actions rather than letting them stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of keywords ("boundary," "dissolve," "humming") and a monotonous Subject-Verb sentence cadence. The text relies on "purple" descriptors ("lantern-moth hush") that lose impact through overuse and lack of concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from tautologies ("spiral that spiraled") and high-density abstraction that obscures the action. The logical continuity error regarding the prop's possession (holding it before trading for it) creates significant confusion on the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative, but the repetition of the phrase "golden shadows" (four times in a short space) creates a noticeable lexical loop. Some metaphors ("spin at whisper-speed," "shadows that seemed to breathe") border on purple, slightly obscuring physical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose density is high but often veers into mixed or strained metaphors ("voice like curtains closing and opening"). The repetition of specific phrases (likely prompt requirements) like "genuinely artificial" and "curtains of intention" becomes mechanical, creating text artifacts that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from metaphor strain ("tiny crystal of a broken economy," "tape... like a tongue telling truths") that obscures clarity for the sake of style. The triple repetition of the phrase "steadily curious" creates a distracted, repetitive cadence that feels like a prompt-compliance artifact rather than a rhythmic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("mists of time," "forgotten sentinels," "double-edged sword"). The forced inclusion of prompt phrases leads to logical oxymorons and awkward constructions, such as "steady unpredictable heartbeat"—a contradiction that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lexical repetition is a major issue; "luminous" appears four times and "softly deliberate" three times in a short space, creating a drone. The prose relies on abstract noun phrases ("earth turned to memory") that obscure clarity and reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally polished but suffers from moments of overwriting and telling. Phrases like "liquid silver," "weight of shame," and "perfect spiral of trust" rely on abstraction and cliché rather than fresh observation. The sentence-level craft is solid, but the reliance on emotive adjectives ("quiet vividness," "deliberate purpose") drags on the density.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by purple phrasing ("hidden in the blood," "meteor hush," "heart a steady drum") and cliché imagery. There is a tendency toward repetitive sentence structures and "telling" summaries that bypass the opportunity for concrete, active scene work. The density of figurative language often muddles the physical action rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the prose features evocative imagery ("celluloid ghosts," "sleeping snake"), it suffers significantly from the redundant insertion of prompt keywords. The phrase "spatially imaginative" appears four times and "hushed thunder" three times in a short space, creating a template-cadence artifact that drags down the otherwise high-quality writing. These repetitions break the flow and feel like unintegrated checklist items rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, mixed metaphors, and repetitive phrasing ("shadowed rapture," "stardust" x4, "unwritten" x2). The reliance on stock imagery ("curled like smoke," "dance of light and dark") and lack of concrete verbs creates a sluggish, abstract reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on "adjective-noun of abstract-noun" constructions and mixed metaphors ("bled notes that fell as rain"). Phrases like "stubborn mutation of nostalgia" and "cancer of nothing" prioritize sound over precise meaning, creating a "purple" texture that obscures the physical action in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns ("frequency," "syntax," "paradox") and lacking in concrete, grounded action. Key moments are summarized ("The probable miracles accumulated") rather than shown in scene, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.7)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("shoreline lullaby" appears 6 times; "gentle/persistent" variations appear 5+ times) creates a distracting, algorithmic loop. The prose leans on abstract noun-heavy metaphors ("constellation of permission") that reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative, though it occasionally leans into melodrama ("nerve endings screamed," "splinter... through spinal cord"). The list-like explanation of the theme in the penultimate section drags the pacing slightly. Otherwise, the sensory details are sharp and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is overwritten and dense with "purple" metaphors, including the repetitive use of "symphony" and clunky phrasing like "each tome a tomb." The reliance on simile ("drift like dandelion seeds," "unraveling like a worn tapestry") weakens the direct impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of the phrase "periodically eternal" (five occurrences), which acts as a jarring text artifact. Additionally, the writing relies on clichés ("silent scream," "heartbeat of the ocean," "white shroud") and filter verbs ("She noticed," "She wondered") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the rhythm is smooth, the prose relies heavily on abstract oxymorons ("violent peace," "silent storm," "thunderous serenity") to convey depth. These constructions muddy the clarity of the peak moment rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("syllables that tasted like iron and smoke"). There is a tendency toward slightly purple description, but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("crumpled photograph," "somatic") and reliance on occasional clichés ("soft as velvet"). The final paragraph's summary nature drags down the momentum, and the "somatic" terminology feels inserted rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and memorable imagery ("threads... knotted into an impossible cat's cradle"). There are moments of metaphor strain ("ache... was luminescent") and slight repetition of concepts (salt/weeping), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("wind carved," "consciously wild," "serene anger," "ephemeral") creates a mechanical, prompt-stitching cadence. The prose suffers from "purple" artifacts and heavy metaphor density ("vanished like whispers," "words molasses slow") that obscures clarity and drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of multiple long phrases ("within the blink that follows surprise," "dangerous liaison letter," "dizzying quiet") within a short space. These repetitions read as forced insertions rather than organic motifs, creating a stuttering rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-heavy descriptions ("rusted rifle," "tranquil blaze") and repetitive sentence structures. The integration of required phrases is jarring, disrupting the rhythm of otherwise competent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from extreme repetitive strain: the word "transliterated" appears ten times in a short text, becoming a distracting artifact that obscures the action. Additionally, the phrase "cool-headed" is looped four times. This level of lexical churning prevents the story from meeting the standard of flawless literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but the density of figurative language in the second half ("gravity well," "event horizon," "black hole," "supernova") becomes crowded, triggering a density deduction. The simile "fog billowed like old headlines dissolving into mist" feels slightly strained. Line-level momentum is generally good despite the metaphor load.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("silence fell like cosmic dust"), maintaining a strong rhythm. A few phrases lean toward the abstract ("cold absolution of forgotten things"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting and awkward insertion of prompt requirements. Phrases like "interjected... a sharp line" stretch grammatical usage to fit the constraint, and the repetition of "socially perceptive" feels mechanical. The writing relies on abstract noun-adjective pairings ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") that obscure concrete imagery, and the "unlearning" concept is repeated to the point of semantic satiation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe phrase-looping renders the prose mechanical; "shattered sky" appears seven times, and "arms of steel" five times in a short space. The writing relies on adjective-heavy telling and static descriptions that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.5)
    A critical tense error ("ripples intertwine" vs. "She stood") disqualifies the piece from the "flawless" standard. Lexical fatigue is high, with the word "echo" appearing nine times and "fractured timeline" four times in a short space. Abstract phrasing ("lure possibility from the brink") replaces concrete imagery in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe artifacting breaks the prose: the phrase "fractally precise" appears seven times and "willowglass hope" four times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. The writing relies on label-insertion over description, resulting in a mechanical rhythm and low information density.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract metaphors and synesthesia ("heat signatures of feelings," "pulse of warmth tracing ancient grief") that blur clarity and reduce emotional impact to labels. There is a high density of "X was Y" constructions and "show-don't-tell" failures, where emotions are named ("sorrow," "yearning") rather than evoked through concrete imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lush but occasionally drifts into purple territory ("phonetic shards," "prison of light"). A significant tense error occurs with the phrase "As the truth unravels, she began," where the present-tense element clashes with the past-tense narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("silver hush" appears twice) and awkward insertion of prompt terms ("prudently daring" is used twice as a label). The density is fair, but some descriptions feel ornamental ("threads," "shroud") rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is marred by significant artifacting, specifically the repetitive, clunky insertion of prompt phrases ("ambient awareness," "percolate," "palimpsest") which appear 3-4 times each in short succession. The writing is frequently overwrought ("universe of patience collapsing," "distillation they had both pursued"), prioritizing poetic sounding abstractions over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is polished but relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("moisture another impossibility") and expository summary of internal states. While rhythmically competent, the text often tells the reader what to feel ("portable miracle," "sharp gentleness") rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from high metaphor density that obscures clarity, with mixed or clichéd imagery ("trembled like a struck bell") crowding the short word count. The triple repetition of "rhythm of oars in water" acts as a scaffold artifact, disrupting the flow and feeling incongruous with the established urban-garden imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on abstract nouns and pseudo-scientific adjectives ("atomically reflective," "living data," "neural pathways") that clash with the mystic tone. "Brittle awakening" is repeated three times, feeling forced and repetitive. The text lacks density, offering vagueness where concrete imagery is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is saturated with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("whimsical rhythm," "fragile sculpture," "prismatic quiet"). Adjective-noun pairings are predictable and ornamental ("slender shade," "soft spoken potter"). The density of figurative language obscures rather than clarifies, resulting in a text that feels decorated rather than constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is functional and clear, with some vivid imagery (&quot;paint peeled... like dead skin&quot;), but momentum drags during the summary bridge (&quot;Mara spent three sleepless nights&quot;). Some phrasing feels slightly forced to accommodate prompt words, creating minor textural hiccups.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is overwritten with cliché-heavy adjectives ("obstinate stone," "malevolent will," "reluctant sigh") and mixed metaphors ("prismatic desire") that obscure rather than sharpen the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and cliché. Phrasing like "breath on a mirror," "lancing the wound," and "geometries of grief" feels stylized to the point of melodrama. The density of metaphorical language sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the prose has moments of vivid imagery ("wet wool in her lungs"), it is severely hampered by text artifacts. The phrase "spongey dread" appears four times and "nervously confident" three times in a short space, creating distinct loop penalties that obscure the craft and pull the reader out of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("luminous disbelief" x3, "pixelated amnesty" x3, "scaffold wrap" x4) creates significant loop artifacts that stall momentum. The prose favors abstract metaphor over concrete action, leading to density issues where imagery obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe overwriting and lexical loops disqualify this from high-band consideration; the phrase "polished calm" appears six times, and "calm" nine times, creating a drone-like repetition. The prose is cluttered with mixed metaphors ("shadow trailing like a faded banner") and excessive simile usage that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose leans toward overwriting ("finger accusing the darkness," "photonic amber") and relies on filter verbs ("She saw," "She watched") that distance the action. Philosophical intrusions and abstract descriptions ("words glowed... with weight") reduce the visceral impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.4)
    The phrase "warlike serenity" is repeated verbatim three times (lines 13, 27, 31), creating a distracting artifact that stalls momentum. The prose is laden with adjective-heavy modification that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract metaphors and clunky modifiers ("purposefully curious fingers"). Phrases like "clarion note" and "dreamstuff" read as genre clichés, and the density of filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "understood") distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant text artifacts act as a drag on the prose; complex phrases like "inlaying meaning everywhere" and "fiercely gentle" are repeated 3–4 times each. This extreme redundancy signals a failure to integrate required elements organically, resulting in visible scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten with a high density of abstract metaphors ("silence a canvas," "shadow... like a reminder") that obscure rather than reveal. The word "echo" appears excessively (approx. 8 times), creating a repetitive loop that dulls its impact. The phrase "confidently uncertain" is an oxymoronic clich&#233; that weakens the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the prose is generally fluid, the story suffers from noticeable repetition artifacts (scaffold loops). The phrase "haunted ambition" appears four times, and "kindly methodical" and "touching distance" are repeated verbatim, diminishing the lexical richness. These echoes feel like unedited prompt adherence rather than intentional motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rich, high-density imagery ("silver pools," "amber," "tessellated floor") builds a strong texture. However, the prose stumbles at the end with rhetorical repetition ("Let them...") and summary statements that explain the plot's meaning rather than letting the transmuted object speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, though it relies on some clichés ("ribs of a starving beast"). The insertion of the required phrase "heartbeat of a hesitation" creates a slight syntactic bump but is handled reasonably well. No major technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is severely overwritten, suffering from "metaphor glut" where similes clutter nearly every sentence ("like a needle," "like rust," "like wounds," "like a tapestry"). This density creates a sluggish rhythm and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene, triggering significant deductions for text artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, most notably pasting the phrase "cautious exuberance" three times in a short space, which breaks immersion. The reliance on adjective-heavy, "purple" descriptions ("fog clung... like whispered secrets") creates drag without adding information density.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant lexical repetition (six uses of "promise," four of "velvet," multiple "glows" and "dewdrops") that creates a distracting echo. Additionally, the text relies on clichés ("smooth as silk," "golden cage") and stock phrasing that lowers the literary quality expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong imagery ("rendered in photons"). However, the rhyming title "beautician mortician" clashes with the solemn "radiant hush" tone, and the verbatim repetition of "lucidly watchful" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from simile density ("like spilled milk," "like dark serpents," "like dawn," "like smoke") and adjective-noun stacking ("luminous memories," "deliberate reverence"). These artifacts clutter the rhythm and reduce the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is laden with purple abstractions ("symphony of acceptance," "dancing glow") and cliché pairings. There is a lack of concrete imagery, with the text relying on "tell-heavy" summaries of emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from a high density of abstract metaphors ("tapestry of revelation," "fragment of truth") and clichés ("heartbeat of the cosmos," "autumn bark") that obscure the action. There is a tendency to "tell" significance through adjectives rather than earning it through concrete nouns and verbs. The rhythm is lulling but repetitive, lacking the sharp edges needed to ground the metaphysical content.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    The phrase "centuries of layered dust" repeats four times in a short text, creating a severe rhythmic loop that dulls engagement. Additionally, the text relies on label-speak ("weathered resolve") instead of describing the quality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm, but the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("accommodated impossibilities," "brilliant dimness") feels slightly mechanical and disrupts the otherwise organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.9)
    Repetitive use of required phrases ("meteor hush," "luminous vow," "signify") creates a stilted, artificial rhythm. Misuse of words for high-flown effect ("cast its gentle signification") results in awkward phrasing. The prose prioritizes decoration over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose suffers from "thesaurus-itis" ("cosmic afterbirth," "causality's corpse") and repetitive word choice ("distill" appears three times in close proximity). Mandatory phrases are pasted in awkwardly ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt"), disrupting the rhythm and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Imagery is often vivid ("blue ice"), but the prose occasionally slips into mixed metaphors ("refracting through glass and grief") and summary-heavy realizations. These artifacts obscure the immediate sensory experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive use of prompt phrases ("lukewarm," "brittle devotion," "earnest naivety") which appear three times each as static labels. Adjective-noun pairing is excessive ("ancient stones," "faded twilight," "contained starlight"), creating a dense, purple texture that slows momentum. These artifacts function as scaffolding that tells the reader how to feel rather than showing the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose flows competently but relies on clichés ("ghostly outlines," "silent witness") and oxymoronic phrasing ("midnight ridgeway at twilight") that muddles clarity. "Purple" descriptors like "perfume of resurrection" distract from the concrete reality of the scene. The polishing cannot hide the underlying logical gaps in the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten, relying on dense adjectival strings ("captive moonlight," "ancient song," "visible music") that clutter the imagery. The climax relies on abstract summary ("let logic and intuition dissolve") rather than concrete, grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive artifacts dominate the prose. The phrase "soundless echo" appears five times, and "watcher's burden" five times in a short text, creating a distracting loop that destroys immersion. Adjective-noun pairings often lean towards purple prose ("silent weight," "fragile trust," "distant eyes").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with mixed or abstract metaphors ("formaldehyde swirling like liquid time," "sun of causality"). These flourishes distract from the otherwise sharp imagery. The rhythm is good, but the tendency to explain metaphors ("stones melting like ice...") reduces density.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=1.6)
    Severe text artifacts and repetition render the prose clumsy and mechanical. Specific phrases ("storm born silence," "orthogonal," "safeguarding a space for innovation," "hush of a possibility just born") define the text through loop errors rather than progression. The prose density is low, padded with abstract nouns and filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains striking imagery ("cymbal's sharp kiss"), but suffers from "prompt stuffing" artifacts. The full phrase "pull cord handle" is repeated five times, creating a rhythmic stutter. The word "macerate" is used four times in quick succession, pushing it into semantic satiation. Some metaphors are mixed or overwritten ("bruised fruit that still wanted to ripen").

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe template cadence issue: the "not X but Y" (or "no longer X but Y") syntactic construction is used over a dozen times to deliver insights ("not copper but memory," "not a river but a structure," "not a place but a state"). This pervasive repetition creates a droning, predictable rhythm that dulls the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally high-quality with strong sensory density ("silver serpents cracked and mute"). There is a slight reliance on abstract summary to convey the magic system's logic ("formula wasn't missing an element—it was missing a sacrifice of certainty"), which slows momentum slightly at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("copper sang"). The rhythmic repetition of the word "practical" in the finale is a deliberate stylistic choice that successfully grounds the metaphysical ending in the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetitive looping artifacts are present; the phrase "resiliently positive" appears four times, and "empty hourglass" six times, creating a checklist feel. The prose is dense with adjectives and abstract metaphors ("starlight fell in silver threads") that clutter the line-level momentum without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but relies too heavily on "like [noun]" simile constructions ("like water," "like spider silk," "like a tumor," "like a scream," "like lungs"), which creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. Greater variance in metaphorical phrasing would sharpen the imagery and density.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive artifact insertion, specifically the reuse of clunky phrases ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel," "unfolded horizons") in close proximity. These forced insertions act as scaffolding that disrupts rhythm and transparency, particularly "balancedly curious" used as an adverbial modifier.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe simile fatigue, with nearly every description relying on a comparison ("thin as fog," "like a struck match," "like glass chimes," "like a shroud"). Artifacts of prompt-forcing are visible in lines like "My motivation surges," which reads as functional scaffolding rather than literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally strong but suffers from a high density of figurative language (e.g., "swallowed by the crashing hush," "language... architect") that occasionally obscures clarity. The mix of abstract and concrete metaphors slows momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.0)
    While polished, the prose suffers from "purple" tendencies and mixed metaphors ("rose from the snow like a frozen thought") that value sound over clarity. The text relies heavily on clichés in pivotal moments ("write a new chapter," "wisdom settle like ink"), and the density of abstract similes occasionally obscures the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, but suffers from repetitive phrasing (the attribute "quietly articulate" appears twice as a label). Some descriptions border on purple ("sun that remembered no names"), and the reliance on "And [phrase]" sentence starts creates a slightly monotonous biblical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetition of keyword phrases ("cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed," "static-laden") creates a rhythmic monotony and reads like a checklist. The prose relies heavily on personification ("air itself chuckled," "vines chuckling") and cliché ("silent as stone"), reducing the impact of the imagery. These text artifacts dominate the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from excessive repetition of prompt phrases ("resonantly soft" appears four times; "gap between knowing and understanding" three times), creating a distracting echo. These insertions disrupt the rhythm and feel like artifacts rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from "telling" via adjectives and abstract nouns ("respectfully rebellious," "neon nostalgia") and repeats the phrase "brittle hush" in a short space. The "eyes the colour of cobalt neon" line disrupts the physical reality of the scene with a forced metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with specific phrases ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "quietly persistent") repeated multiple times as labels. Adjective density is high ("gleaming crown," "soft earth"), creating a sluggish rhythm that prioritizes decoration over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and lyrical but suffers from "purple" abstraction (e.g., "dusted with photons," which clashes scientifically). There is a tendency toward metaphor-heavy sentences that prioritize sound over precise meaning ("rhymed perfectly with the library's breathing").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is heavily overwritten, relying on abstract metaphors that blur sense ("rock slick with meaning," "capturing photons still deciding their path"). This density of "purple prose" creates resistance and violates the rubric's standard for concrete imagery, substituting authorial interpretation for sensory proof.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    A significant repetition artifact ("hush of cosmic possibility" appears verbatim twice within a short span) mars the flow. The prose relies on clichés at pivotal moments ("meant nothing and everything"), weakening the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    While some imagery is evocative ("corroded constellations"), the prose suffers from repetitive tagging and summary scaffolding. The recurrence of specific phrases ("chronically curious," "crisp nostalgia") three times each within a short space acts as a text artifact that dulls the rhythm and highlights the constructed nature of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is polished but laden with clichés ("blade wrapped in silk," "dust motes hold their breath") and abstract metaphors ("labyrinths of hesitation") that distance the reader. These artifacts obscure the immediacy of the scene and reduce the emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("radiant hush," "budded silent and brilliant"); specific prompt phrases are repeated mechanically, and the reliance on abstract metaphor distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    While competent, the prose is overwritten and relies heavily on abstract-noun phrases ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest," "prismatic clarity," "perfect fear," "unsolved grief"). This density of metaphor and the recurring "Adjective + Abstract Noun" construction creates a manufactured rhythm that distances the reader from the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=1.9)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition artifacts, with phrases like "methodical curiosity" and "rain-scoured fresco vaults" looping verbatim multiple times. Abstract nouns ("silence," "emptiness," "openness") clutter the sentences, displacing concrete imagery. The density of these loops effectively stalls narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("saltwater calculus"), though it sometimes leans on abstract-concrete zeugmas and heavy similes ("like an old regret"). The writing is technically sound but occasionally prioritizes poetic sounding aphorisms over concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers heavily from "purple" overwriting and abstract nouns ("phantom’s ache," "shimmered with hidden meaning") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. Phrases like "tinkersong wonder" and "driftingly alert" read as forced insertions of prompt vocabulary rather than natural descriptions. The density of metaphors ("walls wept," "air held its breath") creates a cluttered, melodramatic texture that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "half expecting," "appeared blank") and summary shortcuts ("suddenly resolved," "method became clear") instead of showing the sensory process of discovery. While the rhythm is smooth, these line-level artifacts dilute the immediacy of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Imagery is strong ("insect wings," "feathered contrails"), but lexical repetition ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") dampens the effect. The prose is dense but occasionally overwrought in its effort to explain the metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetitive artifacts ("fractally precise" x3, "hush" x3, "infinite" x4) dull the prose. The continuity error regarding the tree species (oak vs. yew) is a major flaw in line-level craft and consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.6)
    Significant repetition artifacts lower the score, specifically the clumsy noun phrases "phrasebook dog-ear" and "sociable isolation" which appear three times each. The prose relies on tell-heavy summarization and illogical connections (hopscotch mirroring navigation) that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive looping of specific descriptor phrases ("driftwood nostalgia" x4, "rhythm of repair" x4, "hauntingly bright" x3) creates a palpable artifact penalty. The prose is overwritten with mixed metaphors ("dust danced like memories," "cogs a tiny heartbeat"), obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies on clichés ("lifeblood," "tapestry of shared purpose") and abstract nouns rather than concrete imagery. The repeated insertion of the label "strangely trustworthy" (three times) disrupts flow and reads as a prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts lower the score; "pane of hush" appears five times, "beautifully flawed" four times, and "vouchsafe" three times in a short space. These repetitions read like a checklist/scaffold rather than purposeful motifs (Loop/Scaffold penalty). The prose leans purple ("dandelion seeds on a wind that wasn't wind") and relies on abstract mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the mechanical birds and the orchard. A few similes lean toward the conventional ("gripped stone like desperate fingers," "bobbing like a question mark"), but the technical descriptions are sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from high-density metaphorical clutter and clichés ("chambers of her heart," "discarded polymer of nature"). These straining figures of speech obscure the action and reduce the emotional impact to melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    Metaphor density is excessive ("like glass birds," "like sand," "like frozen music," "like puncture wounds"), often obscuring action with ornament. Repetitive phrasing of prompt words ("incise," "glimmering parole") creates echoes that stall momentum. The prose explains metaphors immediately after introducing them.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    While evocative, the prose suffers from a density of figurative language that sometimes obscures clarity (e.g., "stalactites of condensed sorrow," "remorse... gravity"). The reliance on metaphor over concrete grounding in high-pressure beats prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose relies on clichés and mixed metaphors ("satchel heavy with sheet music and hope"). The repetition of the "hush of borrowed starlight" refrain feels ornamental rather than cumulative. The writing frequently tells rather than shows, substituting summary for sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.8)
    Line-level craft is marred by extreme lexical looping; "chaotically precise" and "quaking" appear frequently enough to become distracting artifacts. The prose relies heavily on "telling" frames ("This was not gentle change but...") and mixed metaphors that clutter rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant text artifacts lower the score: the clumsy phrase "clandestinely luminous" appears three times, and "latent blaze" four times, creating a noticeable synonym loop/scaffold effect. These repetitions act as dragging anchors rather than meaningful motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is weighed down by repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("intensely quiet," "empathy in motion") and mixed metaphors (spiderwebs as sheet music). The mechanical mismatch of "strumming" with a "bow" creates a logical artifact in the physical description.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is marred by abstract telling ("metaphysical vertigo") and direct emotion labels ("hopeful melancholy"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "thoughtfully precise" as a modifier feels mechanical and forced rather than organic to the character's description.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose is functional but marred by "purple" overwriting ("throbbed with the heartbeat," "scattering light like a thousand silent voices"). Several metaphors are mixed or cliché, and the reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs weakens the line-level impact. The writing tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant prose artifacts and redundancies lower the score, such as "olfactorily sensitive nose" (pleonasm) and "journal in which he would journalize" (polyptoton/loop). The phrase "wildflower hush" is repeated three times as a refrain, becoming a distraction. The prose relies heavily on adjectives and mixed metaphors ("turning of the tide's thought") rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from purple phrasing ("centrifuge of silence") and scaffolded prompt-checking ("Here was the attribute"). The reliance on abstract labels to describe physical sensations ("genetic grief") reduces line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is weighed down by passive constructions ("The method she employed was documenting") and expository telling ("Her training taught her to be rapidly adapting"). Information density is diluted by these scaffolds, slowing momentum during what should be active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive phrasing ("sculpted hush" appears four times; "wonder" six times) and adjective-noun clutter ("crystalline air," "amber music sheet," "silent symphony"). The lexical density is low due to this repetition, and metaphors like the "ribbon" are recycled within a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.8)
    A critical grammatical error at the inciting action ("uncase" instead of "uncased") undermines the story's polish at a pivotal moment. Phrasing is often strained ("fell into an avalanchingly quiet" is missing a head noun), and the reliance on abstract simile ("heavy with unshed rain," "mind full of regret") reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by a notable proofreading error ("a algebraic equation") and a reliance on adjectival abstraction ("lucid turbulence," "dissonant chord"). Several phrases lean toward cliché ("pulsing like a captured heartbeat").

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose fails the "publishable" standard due to severe text artifacts: a full paragraph is repeated verbatim, and key phrases are looped excessively ("vibrating sympathetically" appears as a sentence opener immediately after being used in the previous sentence). These issues indicate a lack of basic editing and render the text unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density; constructions like &quot;lace that mapped grief&quot; and &quot;color of grief&quot; pile abstractions atop one another. While the rhythm is good, the reliance on genitive metaphors (X of Y) flattens the emotional impact by intellectualizing the sensory experience. The explanation of the &quot;truthful lie&quot; introduces expository drag at the critical closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("shadows like trapped fireflies"). However, the text suffers from occasional melodramatic phrasing ("impossible weight," "consuming silence") and the required attribute "stoically sparkling" creates an awkward pathetic fallacy that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from abstract metaphors ("twilight betrayed by dawn," "grief turned inside-out") that obscure clarity. The rhythm is good, but the reliance on "tasting of forgotten promises" style synesthesia leans toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing, particularly the forced inclusion of "cyclically spontaneous" and the four-time repetition of "weight of withheld truth," which creates a rhythmic drag. The reliance on abstract nouns ("chaos," "possibility," "truth") obscures the physical reality of the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from the repetitive use of the prompt phrase "luminescent ache" as a label rather than an evoked feeling. Frequent filter verbs and standard sentence structures reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely marred by the repetitive looping of prompt-specific phrases; "accidentally prophetic," "shadowed elation," and "ancient shadows" appear multiple times in short succession, creating a robotic cadence. The writing relies on standard "not X but Y" constructions and adjective-heavy description that slows momentum. This level of repetition indicates a lack of line-level control and editing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases damages flow; "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" appear multiple times as clumsy tags. A significant tautology ("valley mist pooled... hiding the world in valley-mist wonder") mars the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" abstraction (e.g., "charted sorrow," "quantified in silent weight") that reduces concrete clarity. While readable, the reliance on high-flown metaphor occasionally obscures the physical mechanics of the scene. The "pin" echo at the end is a nice structural touch, though the emotional weight is light.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.0)
    The text contains a massive redundancy artifact where the second half paraphrases the first. Line-level prose is dense with clichés ("shards of the past", "tapestry of threads"), and the "jigsaw of stars" metaphor is strained.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with abstract nouns and purple phrasing ("matryoshka dolls of meaning"). The specific phrase "enlarged tranquility" is repeated three times verbatim, acting as a forced scaffold rather than an organic motif. The text relies on "X was Y" constructions to define reality rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    A significant repetitive artifact severely harms line-level quality: the distinct, clumsy phrase "heuristically gentle" appears four times in under 800 words. This redundance reads as a forced constraint or editing oversight, disqualifying the prose from high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=2.0)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("luminous vows" appears >10 times; "quartz hush" ~5 times) constitutes a fatal fluency failure. The prose relies on scaffolded telling ("The chief's motivation was...") and synonym loops that prevent narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from simile density, with constructions like "like a forgotten promise," "like a second heartbeat," and "like a splintering mast" appearing too frequently. This overuse of figurative language slows momentum and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is dense and evocative ("memory was a geological layer"), but the repetition of prompt phrases—specifically "terrestrially cosmic" appearing three times and "luminous skeptic" echoing clearly—creates a slight scaffold effect. These recurrences feel like checklist anchors rather than organic variations, momentarily stalling the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.3)
    Repetitive insertion of multi-word phrases ("auroral sorrow" x3, "mnemonically gifted" x2) creates significant scaffold artifacts. Purple descriptions and clichéd rhymes ("tomb/womb") reduce line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the imagery is polished, the sentence structure suffers from a repetitive "She [verb]" cadence during the rising action ("She gathered," "She moved," "She touched," "She realized"). Phrases like "slick with evasion" and "heart quickening" rely on clichés that dull the prose's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is frequently overwritten and "purple," relying on dense strings of abstract metaphors ("tremor of unspoken things," "brittle precision," "ocean's memory") that obscure clarity. The high density of adjectives and modifying phrases slows the reading rhythm and creates a distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is functional but dense with figurative language that sometimes obscures rather than reveals ("fragile as doubt" is an abstract simile that lacks sensory grounding). There is a tendency toward overwriting ("tin screaming," "terrifying wonder") that creates a texture of constant high-intensity imagery, reducing the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose is overwritten and prone to mixed metaphors ("tracker in a sandstorm calm") and clichés ("eyes filled with tears"). "Bouquets of gossip" and "strangled its post" strain for poetic effect without precision.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from overwriting and heavy metaphor use ("grim of fate," "baptism," "alchemy") that distances the reader. The final paragraph serves as a summary scaffolding that explains the plot, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level craft is marred by clichés ("heavy as an anchor," "eyes clearing like fogged glass") and mixed metaphors ("galaxy of grounds"). The repetition of "gleaming silence" appears three times as a forced structural marker rather than a developing image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive artifacting. Distinct phrases like "tranquil blaze" (3x), "smoothed hush" (4x), and "terrestrially cosmic" (3x) appear in a short text with no variation, creating a jarring, template-like cadence that breaks immersion and signals a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme metaphor density; nearly every description forces a linguistic comparison ("conjugate verbs of escape," "subjunctive mood of hypothetical structures," "meteors fell like periods"), which eventually dulls the imagery. Additionally, the prompt phrase "patiently nimble" is repeated twice, the second time resulting in a grammatical error ("moved patiently nimble") that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is marred by repetitive phrasing ("resonance structures" x4, "velvet" x4, "tragically radiant" x2) and heavy abstraction in place of concrete action. The reliance on explaining the meaning of images ("not a prison... but a cocoon") reduces the density and impact of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("heritage rose thorn" appears five times; "pearl twilight" four times), creating a mechanical rhythm. Heavy reliance on abstract metaphors ("iron emblem of lies," "sharp as a secret") obscures concrete action, and the insertion of prompt phrases like "wisely enduring" results in awkward, clunky syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive phrasing artifacts; "reed-blown melancholy" and "serpentine nexus" appear five times each, creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, a reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts: "borrowed starlight" appears seven times and "windows of connection" four times in a short space, creating a monotonous drone. Purple prose ("ribs jutting like broken promises") and clichés substitute for precise description.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with modifier stacking ("soft exhalations," "fleeting constellations," "quiet resolve") and purple phrasing. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings slows momentum and obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is functional but marred by "telling" shortcuts ("As he pieced together... a pattern emerged") and awkward prompt insertions ("Sharply observant, he collected..."). These structures flatten the tension of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with strong imagery ("greasy smell of vacuum tubes"). There is a tendency toward density that occasionally slows momentum ("cobalt glass portico revealed its hidden etchings"), but line-level craft is generally high quality with no distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but suffers from high density of "X of Y" constructions and similes ("varnish peeled like old sunburn," "tasted of honey and rust," "droplets of pure, singable light"). This poetic density slows momentum and occasionally drifts into purple prose. The line-level craft is competent but needs pruning to allow the image to stand without constant adjectival support.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density and adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset dripped," "molten coin"). The "logically... emotionally..." parallel structure feels mechanical, and the high concentration of figurative language occasionally obscures the scene's geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose has strong rhythmic moments, but the repetition of specific prompt phrases ("softly purposeful," "unyoke") becomes distracting and mechanical. The reliance on abstract nouns ("horizons of possibility," "intention") weakens the line-level impact of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("watchfully calm," "entangled memories," "reverberate") which appear multiple times in identical or near-identical forms. This creates a "checklist" effect that severely disrupts the reading flow and signals a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose flows rhythmically but is marred by a high density of clichés ("silence louder than any scream," "precision of a surgeon," "patience of a saint"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and reduce line-level freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    While there are strong lines ("first molecules learned to rust"), the prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("steadily curious" x3, "irreverent awe" x2, "groaning/groaned"). These repetitions feel like forced insertions rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=2.8)
    The phrase "echo of forgotten songs" repeats verbatim four times (six variations total) in a short text, creating a severe, unintentional loop. Syntactic monotony is pervasive, with the majority of sentences starting with "She [verb]" (She had, She noticed, She began, She poured, etc.). Telling dominates showing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    Line-level craft suffers from clumsy prompt-stuffing, notably the ungrammatical "Kael stood calmly intuitive" and the repetitive use of "weighted breath before reply" (three times). "Shadow" is overused as a descriptor (shadow-laced, shadow-weaving, shadows coiled, shadows surged), creating lexical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (frequent "She [verb]" openers) and clichéd similes ("like a bone snapping," "like the tide pulling back"). The tense error ("grips") is a significant artifact that disrupts the reading flow and suggests a lack of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of specific phrases ("gently persuasive" appears four times; "intersubjective understanding" three times), creating a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm. Metaphors are often mixed or overwrought ("flowed like the subtle passion of autumn itself"). The density of modifiers and abstract nouns obscures clarity and drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.0)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("strangely honest" x5, "whisperfield calm" x6) constitutes a major text-artifact failure. These loops disrupt prose rhythm and reduce descriptors to meaningless tags.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifact repetition (exact prompt phrases repeated verbatim multiple times) and relies heavily on abstract nouns ("transmute pain," "topography of memory") rather than concrete action. The repetitive sentence structures and "tell-y" descriptions stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive looping of key phrases. "Suspended hush" (3x), "fractured sequences" (3x), and forms of "testify/testimony" (7x) appear within a short word count, creating a mechanical, algorithmic rhythm that distracts from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive vocabulary ("longing" x4, "echo" x6) and filter verbs ("he felt," "he thought") that distance the reader. The technical slip regarding "humming" rusted VCRs and the reliance on abstract descriptors ("tidal longing") reduce immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.5)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive looping, with the phrase "luminous ache" appearing five times and "ephemeral" four times in a short span, creating a distraction that mimics a generator artifact. These redundancies, alongside "changelessly constant," clutter the prose and reduce information density.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is choked with purple artifacts and mixed metaphors ("numbers were a poem of finality," "years of silence cracked like a thin layer of ice"). High-pressure moments are diluted by abstract labeling ("scent of hope," "radiant haven"), and the reliance on "to be" verbs paired with abstract nouns drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose contains repetitive phrasing ("quiet, deliberate" appears twice almost verbatim) and some purple descriptions ("glinting like frozen starlight"). The detail about spoons bending reality feels like an inserted prompt artifact that clashes with the otherwise serious tone.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished with high density and strong imagery (morning glories as points of light). A few metaphors border on overwriting ("cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow..."), but the rhythm and clarity generally hold up well.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from high artifact density, including awkward adverbs ("reflectively vibrant") and forced phrasing ("air carried a zephyr bloom"). The reliance on abstract metaphors ("pearl of stillness," "constellation of pearls") creates a "purple prose" haze that obscures concrete action. Repetitive sentence structures and "filter verbs" (she felt, she imagined) distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but weighed down by label-speak ("quietly proactive" used twice as a tell) and heavy metaphor density. The repetition of prompt phrases as direct descriptors flattens the specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose leans toward purple ("mist coiling... like a question mark") and relies on abstract metaphors ("solidifying as pure yearning") that obscure clarity. The repetitive insertion of multi-word prompt phrases creates a droning, scaffolded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose is functional but marred by "purple" descriptors and repetitive phrasing ("gathering hush," "golden" appears 8 times). The text leans on cliché constructions ("voice as soft as morning mist," "blazing bright") and list-like sentence structures that flatten the rhythm. There is a lack of concrete, specific imagery in favor of abstract sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts: the phrase "moving stillness" appears four times, and "safekept" three times, creating a jarring echo in a short piece. The writing often slips into "telling" mode to explain the significance of actions ("a physical demonstration of patience") rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished but relies on some clichés ("world held its breath," "autumn's final gasp") and expository characterization ("peripherally focused by nature"). While the imagery of the mechanism is strong, the "cellar of reason" metaphor feels overwritten and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with evocative imagery ("wick-holder's shadow... perfect spiral"). The score is held back slightly by the forced inclusion of the adverb "boundary-lessly," which creates a syntactic stumble in an otherwise polished rhythmic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.5)
    Significant deductions for repetitive artifacts: "rust-hued peace" (3x), "here-and-gone" (4x), and "hauntingly practical" (2x) create a loop effect. These forced repetitions disrupt the rhythm and make the prose feel algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from extreme simile saturation ("like a liquid mirror," "like leaves," "like dew," "like a talisman," "like a match"), creating a droning rhythm and "purple" texture. Metaphors are often mixed or logically loose ("kinetic lagoon" implies motion, yet it is a "mirror" and the scene is "still"), prioritizing sound over sense.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from a template cadence ("First... Next...") that flattens momentum. Overwriting and purple metaphors ("metal bones," "lullaby of infrastructure") gloss over mechanical causalities, substituting flowery description for concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe text artifacts are present. The distinct phrase "excruciatingly gentle" appears five times, and "glacial hush" appears five times in a short text. This redundant looping creates a drumbeat that severely mars the prose quality and touches the closure beat, triggering a substantial deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    Severe template cadence hampers the prose; nearly every paragraph and sentence begins with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating a monotonous rhythm. The writing suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and mixed metaphors ("facades rose like pages... each brick a word") that obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm. However, lexical repetition weakens the effect: "oceanic hush," "infinitely patient/infinite patience," and "secret weavers" all appear repeatedly within a short space, creating a loop effect that feels like unedited fatigue rather than intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose suffers from a high density of "purple" artifacts and strained metaphors ("shadows folding around it like a shroud," "tapestries hanging like frozen breath") that obscure clarity. Paraphrase loops are frequent (e.g., describing the act as "intimate" and then immediately redefining it as a "private ritual"), stalling narrative momentum. The sentence structure becomes repetitive ("She wrote... She imagined... She knelt..."), creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is severely hampered by the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases ("quaking reverie" x3, "bittersweet/bitterly sweet" x4, "hypothesizing" x4, "flawed genesis" x3) within a short word count. These repetitions create a mechanical, checklist-like rhythm that distracts from the imagery. The constant restatement of these terms acts as a significant artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is repetitive and loop-heavy, with phrases like "migrating clouds" and "unyielding compassion" recurring as forced refrains rather than organic motifs. The writing relies on purple abstractions ("kelp-drift peace," "earth's own ash") and filter verbs ("She knew," "She imagined") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is overwritten with "purple" descriptors ("liquid light," "cobalt, amber, and crimson") and clichéd metaphors that prioritize sound over clarity. Repeated phrases like "defiant hush" act as text artifacts that explain the mood rather than evoking it through action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing that reads as forced constraint insertion. "Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears four times and "troubling serenity" three times in a short text, creating a robotic template cadence that disrupts momentum and dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is polished but suffers from frequent simile usage ("like candle flames," "like wind," "like a prayer") that distances the imagery. The phrase "fiercely meditative" is a clunky adverb-adjective pairing inserted to satisfy the prompt, disrupting the natural flow of the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery like "letters so small they seemed to vibrate." The prompt-required phrase "searing reverie" leans slightly purple, but the surrounding text supports the elevated tone well. Line-level craft is polished, with no scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=1.9)
    Severe repetitive looping of prompt phrases ("velveteen gloom" x4, "uncharted echoes" x3, "tenderly organized" x3) ruins flow and reads as a glitch. Sentence structure is highly repetitive ("He [verb]..."), creating a drumming template cadence that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought, leaning into "purple" descriptions ("ink carried the blue-green memory," "divining rod for hope") that prioritize sound over clarity. There are no major technical errors, but the density of metaphorical language sometimes slows momentum. The explicit use of the prompt phrase "groundedly imaginative" jars against the flow of the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant template cadence issues; nearly every paragraph relies on repetitive Subject-Verb-Mental State openers ("Mira believed," "She kept," "She realized," "Mira imagined"). This, combined with the "And so" summary scaffold, creates a monotonous rhythm that drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.8)
    Significant repetitive artifacts mar the prose. The phrase "somber marvel" is pasted in three times as a noun phrase, and "incomplete" appears six times, indicating a limited lexical pool or forced prompt usage. These repetitions distract from the reading experience and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally dense and evocative ("stories written in silt and bones"). However, the repetition of the phrase "rationally rebellious" as a descriptor creates a text artifact, and several moments rely on telling ("preached their single narrative") where showing would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant looping artifacts, specifically the phrase "expectantly resigned," which appears three times (paragraphs 2, 8, 12), and "traveled stillness," which appears twice. These repetitions, along with clunky phrasing like "denote a shift," disrupt the reading flow and signal a lack of line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose relies heavily on "telling" ("She was informally wise," "Pruning was a gentle rebellion") and cliché phrasing ("heart raced," "literally and figuratively"). The density of metaphors often borders on purple prose, distracting from the physical reality of the scene rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from lexical repetition ("honeyed dusk," "nectar dusk," "darkness tastes like honey") that limits textual variety. The heavy reliance on "honey" as both metaphor and physical description blurs the line between the two, occasionally muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases triggers major artifact penalties; "creeping normality noticer" appears seven times and "streetlights daydream" four times. The prose lacks syntactic variety, relying on abstract assertions and repetitive sentence stems ("He [verb]...") that flatten the momentum and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose has strong moments of imagery but relies on abstract telling for key emotional beats ("revelation detached something," "compelled her to act"). The use of prompt terms as explicit labels ("incisively kind nature") disrupts the immersive quality, and clichéd pairings like "beautiful, dangerous" detract from the freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic in places ("dice clicked against his ribs"), but significant artifacts drag the score down. The second use of "balancedly daring" ("approached it balancedly daring") is ungrammatical, and the "Timeframe: None" construction is a visible seam.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("saffron quiet" twice, "methodically hopeful" twice, "moon-tipped brush" five times) within a short word count. Reliance on filter verbs ("believed," "heard," "understood," "felt") creates distance. The repetition of prompt terms feels mechanical rather than woven.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is overwritten with adjectival clutter ("haunting," "fragile," "mournful") and lacks rhythmic variety. The phrase "rosewater dread" is repeated three times in a short space, reading as a text-generation artifact or tic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive tagging ("latent radiance" appears six times; "slow exhale of low tide" four times), which reads as forced refrains rather than organic anchors. Metaphors are frequent and sometimes strained ("hunger that ate the light"), reducing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clunky phrasing ("photographically cursed image") and redundancies ("whispering advisor whispered") disrupt the prose rhythm. The forced insertion of required terms like "unbosom" creates awkward sentence structures that draw attention to the writing mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on expository "telling" and abstract adjectives ("restless euphony") to convey the magic's mechanics. Several sentences function as scaffold ("This was the...", "The method was..."), slowing the momentum and distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with sensory detail ("tasted of salt and forgotten language"). The specific prompt phrase "sunwashed dread" is repeated verbatim, which creates a slight artifact effect, but the overall line-level craft remains high and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is dense with "purple" artifacts and mixed metaphors ("iron ribs wrapped in green veins," "silenced voice"). The reliance on adjectives and abstract nouns slows momentum, and repetitive phrasing ("noble lie," "pit of lies") dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant tense error in the climax ("he wrest the cornerstone" should be *wrested*) undermines the prose quality. Additionally, awkward phrasing like "moved stoically sensitive" and purple descriptors ("hushed blaze," "mortar of memory") detract from the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe repetition artifacts: "reclaimed stillness" appears four times and "dappled resolve" three times, creating a mechanical rhythm. The prose is overwritten with abstract modifiers rather than concrete verbs and nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition of prompt phrases damages the prose; "luminous torment" appears four times and "descending while ascending" three times, creating a loop artifact. Figurative language occasionally drifts into purple prose ("wept light") that obscures rather than sharpens the image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from significant overwriting and abstract clutter ("atomic rage," "immaculate potential," "phantom diamonds," "galaxy of unspent futures"). The density of adjectives and metaphors in high-pressure beats obscures the physical action, and the repetition of the phrase "bleak exhilaration" feels like a scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the prose is generally polished, the forced repetition of prompt phrases ("brilliant dimness," "perpetually surprised") creates a mechanical rhythm that disrupts immersion. These repetitions read as scaffolding rather than organic motifs, lowering the craft score.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("weight" x6, "sieved hush" x3, "manufacture false memories" x3, "withheld truth" x3) creates a robotic, template-like cadence. These phrase loops act as visible artifacts that stall momentum. The prose relies on abstract nominalizations rather than concrete, sensory verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is polished but occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("heavy breath of history") and repetition of the prompt phrase "furrowed hush." The use of the word "recycle" in a fantasy setting creates a slight register clash, feeling modern and mechanical against the archaic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The repeated use of "merrily melancholic" is a significant clunk that reads like a forced insertion rather than organic description. Abstract phrasings like "expectations collapse" and "backlash of regrets" reduce line-level density and immediacy. The prose is functional but marred by these prompt-artifact textures that call attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.6)
    Prose is weighed down by purple phrasing ("delicately robust," "forgotten water") and mechanical repetition of prompt terms. Clumsy oxymorons and abstract metaphors obscure clarity ("heart a drumbeat of jaded wonder"). The writing relies on telling rather than showing, with frequent filter verbs and expository scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is dense with "purple" descriptors and clichés ("ancient fire," "twin moons," "ghost in the moonlight"). Prompt phrases ("paradoxically steady," "cosmic intimacy") are inserted verbatim as labels, sometimes repetitively, creating a checklist feel that disrupts narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the imagery is dense, distinct phrases repeat noticeably within the short word count ("choking" x3, "willingly perplexed" x2, "cloudbound" x2), creating a looping effect. The prose tends toward adjectival stacking ("perfect memory," "silver light," "pink fingers") that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally dense and propulsive, with strong rhythm in the stitching sequence. However, reliance on stock literary phrasings like "curled like grief itself," "stars hung like unanswered prayers," and "terrible beauty" detracts slightly from the otherwise specific imagery, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose strives for a lyrical, mythic quality but often lapses into "purple" overwriting ("hush that vibrated with subsonic thunder"). There are moments of clunky exposition ("clogging a filter that had been poisoning the village"), and the reliance on abstract nouns creates a distance that reduces the immediacy of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is generally competent but suffers from the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. "Calmly inventive" and "winking hush" are repeated verbatim, creating noticeable artifacts that break immersion. The explanation of the pneumatic solution is rushed and lacks the tactile clarity present in the earlier description of the latches.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the rhythm is generally good, the prose suffers from noticeable lexical repetition (e.g., "whispering" three times, "promise" five times, "borrowed dawn" three times) that clutters the texture. Additionally, the logical disconnect of standing in a frictionless world distracts from the line-level authority.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from high-density "purple" artifacts and strained metaphors (e.g., "wax breaking like a brittle promise," "cloak sewn from lightning"). These constructions obscure the action and clutter the line-level rhythm. The reliance on adjective-noun pairings ("furious calm," "rarefied air," "brittle promise") creates a repetitive, heavy cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of the phrase "questions into destinations" (four times) and "dignified chaos," creating a scaffolded feel. Abstract metaphors ("unspent thunder," "melody in his heart") crowd out concrete imagery, resulting in a lack of density and line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from "purple" overwriting ("petal of defiance," "garden of stories") and recognizable clichés ("heart swelled," "laugh like breaking glass"). Metaphors are frequent and often mixed, cluttering the line-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers severely from repetitive loops; phrases like "flickering compasses," "broken anniversary clock," and "horizon would invite night" are repeated 4–5 times each, creating a mechanical, droning rhythm. The prompt phrase "strategically creative" is inserted as a clumsy modifier ("His strategically creative mind saw a puzzle") that clashes with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Phrases like "cartography of luminous doubt" and "language of sediment and time" land well within the established voice. The rhythm supports the emotional beats, particularly during the climax on the ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is dense with metaphors ("unspun silk," "sea glass"), occasionally drifting into purple territory ("cerulean regret"). The verbatim repetition of "rhythmically placid" three times constitutes a significant "template cadence" artifact that lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyrical repetition of “billion” and “pattern” borders template cadence but stays purposeful, echoing cosmic and local scales. Mixed metaphor hazard—“wings folded like a discarded map” vs “map” never re-enter—passes because immediacy outweighs brief strain. Information density high; each sentence layers observation with emotional charge. No paraphrase loops or filler stacks; final line is crisp. Artifacts do not touch closure; high-band cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “frost traced lines that matched the ledger’s numbers” packs map, code, and causality into ten words. Metaphors are coherent—glass as river of light—and vanish before muddling. Occasional template cadence (“He... then he...”) appears but never in closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with melt/cool cycle. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—short fragments for fork strikes, longer coils for contemplation—without algorithmic pattern. Only minor scaffold: “silent weight of memory” and “silent expression” recycled stem; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high; each sentence layers frost, vibration, and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for silt-dream languor, fragments for lens-click climax. No loops or synonym churn; “broken by design” vs “fractured by design” is intentional echo. One mixed metaphor—“silence chased like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself”—is earned by surreal logic. Line density high; each sentence advances image or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings avoid templates despite heavy anaphora (“the bell… the ridge…”). Information density high—single sentences deliver food bundle contents, weather, and emotional charge. No synonym loops; metaphors organic (“patina a map of memories”). Proofing clean. One paraphrase loop “gentle/quiet/soft” around Mara recurs; not enough to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and symbolic load. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay within optic/light register. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous fragments,” “spectral form”) fits pilgrim lyric mode. Final third clean—no artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences do double duty: “sap pulsed” conveys both sound and internal clock. Metaphors are interlocking—root/knot/ring—so no mixed vehicle violations. One minor scaffold: “texture of time” is repeated three times; the phrase is thematic glue, so penalty is minimal. No loops in final third; clarity of emerald convergence remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided—ash is consistently both snow and recording medium. High information density: “cells divided in the grafted branches” does triple time-work, body-work, and metaphor-work. The final line “pure and terrible and complete” uses triadic cadence to let the breath out after built-up pressure, earning its overt intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density: “conch pulse mirrors heartbeat” does double sensory-causal work. Minor scaffold—“trembling” repeats—and one mixed metaphor “canvas of trembling stars.” Rhythm breathes across paragraph cuts; noloop obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence music is deliberate: sibilant storms, hard plosives for pebbles, soft nasals for hush—read-aloud variation sustains. No scaffold loops; each mention of silence adds density or reprise. One mixed-metor risk—“rivers of silence across parchment”—but context converts abstraction into legible cartography, so clarity intact. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. Sentences carry double duty: “the same snowflake drifting past his lens” reiterates loop while embodying POV bias. Metaphors stay coherent—violin as neural map—without purple inflation. Information density high; only minor scaffold: “each stroke…a meditation” is tell-y, but single instance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“resonant hush”) that accumulates meaning. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; information density is high. Minor slack: two adjacent “she felt” phrases could compress, yet they do not obscure causality or dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes: long accumulation sentences mirror twilight stretch; short fragments mark lever moment. No template cadence; metaphor vehicles (ferns, petals, threads) stay coherent within magnetic/floral domain. One mixed metaphor—“threads in a cosmic tapestry” after “violet flower petals”—minor, does not touch closure. Density high: each sentence advances sensor alignment or emotional charge; zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: “water lapped against music stands like a tide of forgotten melodies” does triple duty (sense, metaphor, theme). No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One register spike—“conceptual repricing” level diction—reads earned by closure. Minor simultaneity hiccup (“She drew her bow… water began to move”) but action remains clear; no clarity break at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “the aurora bleed across the peaks” compresses color, motion, and metaphor in one verb. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral sorrow,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated for a woman who thinks in data and poetry. One mixed metaphor—“aurora whispered its final lament”—is earned by the personified sorrow established early; it does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal (“beaded valve wheel heavy in his pack, its brass beads clicking like rosary beads he didn't believe in”). No scaffold loops; each image advances. Figurative layering is high but patterned—bead/rosary/eyes/scale—so density reads as design, not clutter. Only micro-slip: “phantom looms and ghost shifts” edges toward stock phrase; still, context re-weights it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentence variety mirrors tidal ebb. Figurative language is sparse but precise: “silence pooled like water,” “paper thin as memory.” No mixed metaphors or loops. Occasional scaffold (“the world outside pressed in...”) is brief and does not dull closure. Clean copy; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence cadence rises and falls with eclipse tempo, no algorithmic pattern. Information density high—each line advances tone, setting, or emotional stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and precise (“hands folded like dried flowers”). Only micro-flaw: occasional adjectival stack (“weathered steps,” “amber twilight”) but these serve compression, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between lyrical elongation and terse revelation, propelling without scaffold. Figurative language is selective—moth-wing pages, battery walls—and never clusters in high-pressure beats. Information density is high: one sentence slips diaries, scorch, transcripts, and motive. The final clause “dreaming of dragons” is trim, sonic, and closure-charged. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift; the only hairline slip is the slightly ornate “conceptual repricing” phrase inside narrative, not character, voice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense but never purple: “lighthouse stood… like a finger pointing at guilty stars” is the single overt simile and it earns its place. Rhythm modulates—long coastal sentences collapse into clipped orchestration beats. No scaffold, no loops; information dual-loads (cookie = instruction + social lever). One micro-slip: “accidentally prophetic” is used twice in close proximity; a sharper variant would avoid echo. Closure line is crisp and image-locked.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm controlled: long clauses swell, then abrupt cuts mimic loop stops. Information density high—each sentence layers silence, color, paradox. Minor scaffold: “the silence she’d recorded” recurs 3× but serves pedal logic. Metaphors stay coherent (indigo = absence) and propel, never stall.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often layers light, sound, and emotional state. Figurative language is patterned early (“silent exclamation mark”) and paid off, avoiding purple drift. Minor scaffold: “the hush had been upturned, turned into a quiet celebration” is a near-paraphrase loop—0.2 deduction. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with action; no filter-verb clot in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: one sentence often jobs—image, motion, concept—without scaffold. Rhythm accelerates at tablet crack, breathes at dissolution. No synonym loops; “glow”/“brightening” recur with purposeful tonal decay. One mixed metaphor—“gravity’s memory”—but paid off by final weightlessness. Minor filter-verb clusters absent. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the beats: long sentences for the cavern hush, staccato for the drum tap. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stake. Clean copy. One hairline slip—“shimmering with a faint filament of hush” edges purple but serves concept, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: every sentence advances data, body, or image—no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (stillness “like a second skin”), avoiding mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated register (“layered tranquility”) fits Elias’s cerebral bent and is earned. No loops, no paraphrase churn; sentence variety propels rather than obtrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and musical; sentence variety is high, with almost no repeated stems. Figurative density is high but patterned—every scent metaphor is paid off by the uncorking. One minor scaffold: “the scent became…” used twice in adjacent sentences mid-story (−0.1). Otherwise information-dense lines carry triple duty (e.g., “compressed elegy for erased species” condenses backstory, theme, and object history).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths, high information density per line. Occasional paraphrase loops—“pattern of knots that mapped moments,” “layers of meaning hidden beneath”—deduct 0.3. Metaphors stay coherent (weave, braid, door) and physically rooted. No artifact touches the closure beat. Tight but not yet surgical; a few nominalizations could be verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative layering is dense—multiple metaphors per paragraph—yet pattern is taught early and maintained, so density reads as texture rather than clutter. Loops are light: “the crackle of the fire fills… the bowl” echoes thrice with variation, not paraphrase. Some sentences do scaffold (“She feels… She sees… She knows”) but momentum survives. Closure image is crisp; no metaphor contradiction obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “honeyed light pooling on stone” compresses color, temperature, and liquidity in five words. Metaphors stay coherent—static as both test and metaphor for blocked connection—no mixed physics. Occasional template cadence (“I watched… I noted… I touched…”) is minor and functional, keeping ritual rhythm. No scaffolding loops obscure causality; each sentence either advances dose or deepens residue.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density—each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere; clean grammar, varied paragraph breath, figurative control except one soft mixed metaphor “wave of gratitude that echoed cycles”; no synonym loops, no scaffold, strong propulsive cadence up to and including final line.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative density is high but patterned early—“remembering,” “frequencies,” “glass wall”—and pays off in the final “luminescent ache.” No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One minor scaffold: “roots taking hold” appears twice within three lines; barely dulls the closure image. Otherwise information-dense, propulsive, clean.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “vine-echo cage,” “liquid architecture,” each noun-verb pair doing double duty. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances image or pressure. One mixed metaphor—“liquid lead” adding weight to moments—barely grazes clarity. Final paragraph slows to match the cosmic hush without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Metaphors are selective and internally consistent (moonlight as liquid silver, grief as fracture). No mixed-vehicle accidents. Loops absent; no synonym churn. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, advances mood, and anchors body. Opening and closing lines carry image-propulsion. Minor scaffold: “gentle, inventive motion” appears twice; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every sentence advances cache logistics or sensory memory; zero paraphrase loops. Metaphors are spare and coherent: “library exhaled shadows like a lung” is singular, not stacked. Information density is high—one sentence can place rungs, date the tape, and foreshadow the boy. Final line “something more delicate had been restored” crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and stress, echoing storm gusts vs. drip-time stillness. Figurative language is spare—vehicles stay vegetal (trellis “breathes,” leaf “whispers”) and do not overcluster. One paraphrase loop: “reconstructing the lattice had never been about fixing what was broken, but about allowing growth…” essentially restates prior paragraph; a −0.2 nudge. Otherwise clean, propulsive, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “squelching boots,” “haggard awe,” “wryly earnest desperation” all do double descriptive work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay physically coherent—brooch as “captured sun” feeds into final amber glow. Final line’s blurred window pane fuses metaphor and action without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is musical, echoing cave’s own; sentence length varies to mimic crescendo/decrescendo. Some near-looping of “bright darkness” and “shimmering glow” but repetition is pattern-taught, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay acoustic/luminous. Information density high; each line advances music or shadow state. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she realized”) in two beats but do not stall closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence mirrors tide—long swells, then abrupt breakers. Information density high—“the ivory stones of the harbor, washed by the recent rain, gleamed like blank pages awaiting inscription” does world, metaphor, and emotional state in one stroke. Zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (reef, map, inscription). Minor template echo—“then a…then a…then a…” in market cries is purposeful list, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but breathable: “the city exhaled its secrets like smoke through manhole covers” performs atmosphere, character, and stakes in one stroke. Rhythm varies—front-loaded participles give way to hammered monosyllables at the threshold (“She stepped forward”)—creating propulsion without algorithmic pattern. One near-loop: “The phantom train ticket punch… the ticket punch” repeats noun phrase within four lines, but the second appearance is qualified by “blazed suddenly,” so the reprise feels visceral, not scaffold. No mixed metaphors; every vehicle (vault of mist, liquid-mercury starlight) sustains its internal physics. Copy is clean; pronoun antecedents track after spatial shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes: long sentences for nocturnal mapping, abrupt fragments when tile pulses. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no filler adjectives. Density is high: a single sentence often layers sensory cue, emotional tilt, and forward motion (“She painted the images onto the tower’s inner walls, turning bare stone into a mural of reflection”). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Copy clean: pronoun “she” always snaps to Lira, telescope/tile/chart geography tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but readable; high information-to-word ratio. Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid rainbows,” “infinite refractions”) flirt with purple, yet pattern is taught early and servesaccumulative lens. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase churn detected. Final image is sharp and uncluttered, sustaining closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence despite repeated “mathematics” motifs. Metaphors stay coherent—ink pot cracks as “old skin,” fluid as “liquefies rigid thinking”—and integrate with physical logic. Information density high: one line can advance clock, mood, and theme (“At 3:04 AM, the director returned...”). Minor scaffold: “waiting actively” phrase appears three times in close proximity; paraphrase-loop check applies −0.2, keeping this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “She traced the light’s journey with her pen, mapping how it kissed the bark and then dissolved into shadow”—propelling action while texturing metaphor. Only minor scaffold: “each page a world” repetitions could lose one instance; “invented histories” phrase recurs without new angle. Figurative coherence is high; vehicles stay optical/chemical, matching lamp physics. No loops obscure causality or dull the final shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high density: “sediment of stories—fragments that drift like tidal debris” performs atmosphere, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional poetic overlap (“texture that emerges is not silk nor burlap, but something sharper”) risks minor metaphor stacking but serves the textural lens. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final sentence propels toward the next departing horn without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; sentence length swells and contracts like music. Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor is sonic or spiral, so coherence holds. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold. One mixed image—“broken skull” dome—barely grazes clarity. Closure line is clean, propulsive, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density—sentences double-duty worldbuilding via sensory verbs (“lights dancing on blackwater”). Occasional overwrought stacked metaphors (“liquid sky”, “fireflies”) slightly dilute peak beats; one mixed metaphor “bed of chipped stone” blurs physical logic. No loops or scaffold, momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; every sentence advances image or beat. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“rock like forgotten seas”). High-pressure flare paragraph balances long breath and staccato clicks. Final line lands clean without echo—only the repeat of “dawning hush” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: single line “shallow basin of mercury caught the depot’s dim gaslight, bending it into patterns her trained mind could translate into circuitry” delivers setting, method, character skill, and plot advancement. Metaphors stay physically coherent (star chart torn along folds). One minor loop: “each connection a prayer whispered into the machine” adjacent to “her fingers dancing with solder” could tighten, but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence layers image, myth, and tactile detail. Occasional metaphor stacking (“dark comma against the white page of sky”) borders on excess yet serves the text-as-map motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; pronouns track cleanly. One mixed vehicle—“mirror of the worrying tranquility”—momentarily blurs agency, keeping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; every sentence either advances the tuning or deepens the acoustic metaphor. Mixed metaphors are avoided—vehicles stay sonic or geological. One minor scaffold: “the town had not collapsed yet, and now—perhaps—it never would” restates the same binary, but it occurs after closure so momentum is already spent. Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, and no filter-verb clusters dull the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is compressed poetry: “water met stone met void” triple-monosyllable enacts the knot dissolving. No loops, no scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse but precise—no mixed metaphors. Final line cadence mirrors the lonesome tone without syntactic uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; metaphor strings (“copperlight repose,” “sustaining impossibilities”) are patterned early and repay in the final glow. One paraphrase loop (“the hush he chased became the lighthouse’s breath… the hush lingered”) lightly dulls the exit beat. Otherwise, high information density and vivid specificity carry momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic variety and sensory specificity; metaphors stay coherent. Minor template cadence in “winter-cracked fields / hush of winter-cracked fields” loop, but it does not touch closure. No scaffold or overwriting; final line is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density high—single lines deliver image + emotional tilt. Minor template cadence in “each night…each morning” triad, but it mirrors loom repetition so reads intentional. One metaphor muddle: “sun rose like a pale orchid” conflates flower and celestial body, yet the slip is brief and does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Information is dense: roots/breath/light triangulate in one clause. Metaphors are coherent (orchard as storyteller) and never mixed. One paraphrase loop detected (“interrupted journeys now slowly resuming” echoes earlier summary) but it does not stall the beat; −0.2 applied. No artifact touches the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with paragraph cuts that change emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean: high density, concrete nouns, varied rhythm, no synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction—“ebony,” “pseudonym creator,” “conceptual repricing”—skirts register drift but remains internally consistent with Kael’s artisanal precision. One mixed metaphor (“fossil of commerce” beside “cathedral”) is minor; no artifact obscures closure. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the motif without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences perform double duty: “autumn leaves scraped the stone floor like whispered secrets” seeds both soundscape and conspiracy. No loops, no scaffold; information density high—each paragraph either advances stitch, flame, or threat. Figurative language is controlled: only one metaphor per beat, never stacked; physical logic intact. Opening and closing lines echo without self-plagiarism, creating cadence bookends that tighten the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence varies between paddle-stroke iambs and spirit-chant anapests. Figurative density high but purposeful—moonlight as silver drink, apology as cracked bell—no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactile or tidal information. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Minor filter-verb cluster (“I felt the unsent letters flutter”) isolated, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (“The coral in his hand is from that beach on Malaita, where a boy once showed him how to find the brain-patterned stones beneath the war’s debris”). No synonym churn or template cadence; metaphors stay physically coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final line is razor-clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is purposeful—“sound bewitched pigment”—and no mixed metaphors intrude on the closing beat. One minor scaffold (“she watched, methodically playful”) is accepted under the lyric pattern, allowing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: one sentence pollinates six boroughs. Rhythm accelerates with bee release, then staccato under detector flicker. Only micro-loop: “warp” used twice in two lines—minor. Metaphors (vine constriction, sonic map) stay biologically coherent. Final line lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, yet figurative density approaches purple in stretches (“fossilized moon,” “kelp in a calm tide,” “phosphorescence yet shaded”) without pattern-teaching variance; high-pressure beats (merfolk surrender) still drip metaphor, warranting −0.4. Several scaffold phrases repeat (“across centuries of longing,” “shyly unstoppable”) creating template cadence, another −0.3. Clause stacks occasionally obscure sequential action (“She sang of lost constellations, of love letters…”) but meaning remains retrievable. Closure line (“a quiet tide that never ceased to turn pain into beauty”) lands cleanly, preventing artifact from touching the final image, capping at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from prepositional to verb-led. Information density high: one sentence often performs atmosphere + interior + motion (“She began to hum…splitting it into harmonic fragments”). No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent (sound as light, fracture as wound). Scaffold-free except one adjacent echo of “extinct feelings”; clarity at closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—“harmonic resurrection theory,” “Jorvik verb conjugations”—yet always welded to emotional stakes. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadence during promise writing, shorter beats at tube whoosh and reply clatter. No mixed metaphors or loops; “quicksilver ink” recurs with accruing meaning. Proofing clean; only minor scaffold (“she wrote until…”) but propels momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong nouns and verbs carry density, but occasional stacked epithets (“dappled resolve of her spirit now burned steady”) flirt with purple; no loops or scaffold, yet figurative slight overload in closure beat keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm accelerates with pigeon releases, then settles into longer cadence at ledger close. No loops or scaffold; every sentence layers job—advance image, deepen motif, tighten stakes. Figurative control peak at “dust map like a question” without mixed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences often syncretize setting, memory, and rule (“Each line corresponds to a distance measured in steps, a sacred count”). Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to fractured fragments that mimic light-splinter. No synonym churn or paraphrase loops; each “fractured hush” recurrence adds semantic layer. Minor overwrought moment—“my resolve is featherly determined, light as down yet unyielding as stone”—is isolated; it does not contaminate the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: cascading anaphora during light-storm, then hushed monosyllables for tide-pool release. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “earth’s glittering throat” is single, sustained vehicle. Minor scaffold: “she watched… she scattered… she pressed…” triple opener inside geode; not painfully repetitive but templated. No artifact touches the closure image; final line is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; metaphor systems (chess, tide, star algorithm) interlock without mixed collisions. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“calculated wilderness,” “conceptual repricing”) is motivated by Ezra’s performative intellect. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances tactic or image. Final third remains clean, allowing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density—each sentence layers image, motion, and metaphysics. Occasional “cosmic”/“celestial” synonym adjacencies and three instances of “elective exile” restatement pull a −0.3 loop penalty; no muddle in closure line, so artifact cap stays above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is artifact-free: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“silver light pooled,” “constellations wheeling overhead”—each image pays off in the final light-scatter. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating on the ascent, breathing at the stone circle, then steadying for the descent. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif of carrying light through broken vessels.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    High-density lines (“gauge now singing a steady hum”) advance both atmosphere and causality; one paraphrase loop (“lucidly watchful” x2) but never in closure beat, so artifact stays minor and momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density—single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work: “Legacy's burden pressed against Mira's ribs like shrapnel” shows cost, metaphor, and embodiment in one stroke. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings avoid drumbeat. One mixed metaphor (“stone remembered everything, absorbed intention like a battery”) is minor and does not touch closure. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary across “She / The / Colors / Mirrors” to avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned (prism, heartbeat, echo) and paid off at closure; no coherence break. Occasional near-loop: “borrowed heartbeat pulsed… echoing terrace caught… air itself seemed to hum” share consonant echoes, but each adds sensory layer, not paraphrase. One pronoun slip: “the painter felt the borrowed heartbeat quicken” right after “heartbeat pulsed in time”—temporal simultaneity risk but readable; not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm modulates: long opening sentence sets cosmic scale, then shorter pulses mirror ritual pacing. Metaphors (“stone from the same terrace”) cohere; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold—“the negotiator… the negotiator”—but never in high-pressure beats. Final line offers crisp image that recharges “flawed beauty” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is spare yet sonically tuned: varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops, metaphors (mirror salt, bruised sky) coherent and brief. Information density high—each sentence advances image or stake. One mixed vehicle (“fractured grace” as both moral and geological) barely grazes clarity; otherwise impeccable, read-aloud fluent, closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    High poetic density skirts overwriting because the prism metaphor is seeded early and paid off in shatter; still, two adjacent “alarming serenity” reprises feel looped. Sentence rhythm breathes with her dance, but occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline walls beneath the ice”) slow propulsion a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either material (cloud-condensed crystals) or metaphysical (“syntax of absence”). Figurative language is sparse, precise, and paid off: “shy visitors” returns as sky embarrassed by its own beauty. No register drift; “esoteric realist” lexicon remains intact even at 47° angle. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long inhalations of description to the staccato of knot-tying, matching breathless altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong read-aloud ear; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. High density: aurora light “painting” bench, card “clogged with frozen soot” do double duty for mood + backstory. Three near-repetitions of “she began/ she touched/ she pulled” create template cadence; penalty −0.3. No mixed metaphors in climax; vehicles stay thermal/optical. Proofing clean; only minor scaffold noted.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density: single sentences deliver setting, metaphor, and emotional charge (“laughing fox stamp pressed by builders who knew even their empire would fall”). Rhythm modulates: long, winding clauses for obsession; abrupt fragments at climb. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; “decaying directive” recurs but each time gains new inflection, so repetition is developmental, not artifact. Only minor scaffold: “each vine a timeline” concept restated three times—costs −0.2 but never clouds closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “ghost-scent of burnt myrrh” does triple duty—sensory, temporal, sacrilegious. No synonym loops; each metaphor (palace as hollow shell, tile as lock) recurs with reweighted meaning. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for star work, single clause at vanish. Only minor slip: “empirically ironic” is self-diagnostic, but occurs mid-process, not at peak beat, so clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates from long hallucinatory sentences to the staccato “It reappears when needed.” Metaphors (pin as vertebrae, resentment as black knot) are precise, not stacked. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Minor filter verb cluster around “felt” in memory transfer, but immediacy survives.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence can render tactile cold, vocative memory, and forward action. Figurative layering is patterned (frost, starlight, glass) and pays off in final image. Minor scaffold: two “mirror” noun repeats within three lines; not at closure so −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries muscular rhythm: varied sentence openings, tactile verbs (“coaxed,” “twitched,” “scampered”). No filter-verb stacks; information density high—single sentence often does description, interiority, and causal push (“she climbed higher… to the oldest tree, where the roots had split the cathedral’s spine”). One paraphrase loop on “leaves yellowing / orchard that had once thrived” costs −0.2, but artifact does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to staccato fragments at the bite. Metaphors are coherent: starlight as thread, fruit as tombstone, no mixed vehicles. One scaffold paraphrase (“nonlinear inheritance meant wisdom arrived…”) is immediately grounded in the bead-stringing image. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; every clause advances image or stakes. The final sentence’s “nonlinear and perfect and endlessly unfolding” triad is earned cadence, not template.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes (“stone warden stirred, its eyes glowing like muted brass” cues danger). Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for descent, clipped “She plucked a volume” for arrival. Figurative density is high but patterned; vehicles stay sonic/organic, avoiding mixed-metaphor crashes. Only minor scaffold: “Together they navigated the labyrinth, following the subtle harmonies that echoed off the walls” could lose “that echoed off the walls” without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally clean, but three adjacent sentences open with “The…” in the garden paragraph, creating template cadence (−0.3). Occasional stacked modifiers (“blissfully aberrant monument”) flirt with purple but stay legible. No loops or synonym churn. Information density high; every sentence advances image or micro-action. Good ear, minor artifact keeps it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. High density: “fable of absence, a story told by what was missing” does triple thematic/orienting/emotional work. Metaphors (starlight fiber, submarine precision) stay consistent to clock/sea idiom. No figurative muddle in peak braid-beat; tactile verbs drive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: one sentence often delivers sensory data, emotional register, and causal push (“stone’s glow now a pulsing heartbeat”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during bloom release, then lengthens into repose.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies: long anaphoric runs (“the same star alignment…”) give way to clipped final clauses. Metaphors stay physically coherent—light as ash, silence as geometry. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she saw / she traced” openers loop without new pressure; the density of figuratives in the beacon-firing beat is high but pattern-taught, so clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet information-dense; most sentences do two jobs (atmosphere + world rule). One paraphrase loop—“preemptively nostalgic grief” / “preemptively nostalgic heart”—costs −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (fog solidifies, shadows stretch generations). No scaffold sentences or template cadence; final line earns its silence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long floral clauses collapse into staccato sparks—“She struck a flint, and the knot erupted.” Figurative layering is dense but patterned; violet blooms foreshadow violet flame, so coherence justifies the lyric load. Information density high: one sentence can layer scent, memory, and tool history without paraphrase. Minor scaffold—“the night still held no stars” repeats the void motif twice within 40 words—dulls slightly but does not obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose carries lyric density without purple drift: each sentence layers image, body, and concept. Strong verbs (“pierced,” “tracing,” “pooling”) and specific nouns (“chalk marks,” “hermit crabs”) keep momentum. One paraphrase loop—“texture of time” echoed twice in 40 words—deducts 0.2; no mixed metaphors or filter stacks. Rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to the terse final line, earning high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate; patterned anaphora (“She tasted…”) teaches cadence yet risks template monotony. Metaphors are coherent—threads, garden, echo—no mixed vehicles. Scaffolding minimal; no paraphrase loops. Information density high: single sentences layer silence-flavor with emotional shift. Occasional elevated diction (“intangibly tangible”) is earned concept-neologism, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates with pulmonary rise-fall; sentences shorten under breath-teaching beats, lengthen in starlit reflection. Figurative language is selective—shadows as exhaled grief—never stacked to blur. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. One near-misstep: “breathing is a bridge we build” flirts with aphorism, but context of scarred hands keeps it embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary. Some metaphor stacks (“exhaling oxygen and secrets,” “stardust, small stars”) border purple yet support lyric tone. No scaffold loops; information density high. One mixed metaphor (“world split into parallel lines” then “threads tightened”) slightly muddies physics but does not obscure causality at closure. Minor register creep toward grandeur keeps it from 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, sentence variance high; no scaffold loops. Figurative layering (“sepia swallowed the yawn,” “golden shadows”) is dense yet patterned, taught early and paid off in final “golden shadows whisper farewell.” One microscopic mixed image—“the world outside seemed to listen”—but it does not touch closure. Info density strong; each line advances tone or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “vines twisted into spirals of light” does world, action, and image in one stroke. No looped stems; each sentence advances pattern or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—strings remain silver, light remains folded, no mixed vehicles. One clause of overwrite—“shivering bliss” repeated three times—ticks the Density flag but never touches the closure beat, so caps at −0.2, leaving room in 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: each sentence carries archival, emotional, and sensory cargo without pad. Metaphors (dust as map, patina as clock) are few, consistent, and physically coherent. No template cadence or synonym loops; openings vary from participial to noun-first. Final paragraph’s “histories, like dust, settle in patterns” offers a crisp recharging image that threads back to the first line.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative layer is selective (“concrete slab rose like a promise”) and never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line often does setting + emotion + stakes (“golden water flood the circuitry”). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined: no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative density is high but patterned—each dewdrop, prism hue, and sax note returns transformed, preventing sprawl. Occasional elevated diction (“refracting the silence into colors”) is earned by consistent lyric contract. Final image breathes cleanly, leaving vivid after-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hush; paragraph breaks mirror seed-spiral pacing. Figurative layers are dense but coherent—moonstone dust as “heartbeat of the sky” stays within physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“emerges transformed always” ×2) is forgiven as motif-teaching. No artifact touches the closing cascade, keeping 9-band in sight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short, pressured fragments (“Water and quartz began to sing”) to longer, liquid clauses that mimic waterfall spray. No synonym loops or paraphrase clutter. Metaphors stay coherent: “mineral deposits…frozen tears” keeps water/ice through-line. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image, not abstraction. One near-loop: “uncertainly certain” appears twice—acceptable because it is a deliberate thematic hook.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm: clauses expand during heating, contract at quench. Metaphors are precise—dragon-steam, brick-ribs—never mixed; physical logic maintained. High information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere + character knowledge + plot advance (“zodiac coin...factually mystical in a way that defied her own ledgers”). One scaffold: “remembering hardness again” repeats stem, but serves as anvil echo, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet musical; figurative language is selective, never stacked. Sentence rhythm accelerates with the gorge’s convulsions, then exhales into the final click. One paraphrase loop—“the hush of the hidden sunrise” repeated—costs the final 0.1, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between clipped proprioceptive readings and longer, UV-saturated clauses, propelling without drumbeat. Figurative language is selective—“violet fire,” “shroud”—and never clusters into purple. Minor scaffold: “she braced again” repeats three times; the echo is purposeful cadence but still noticeable. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks; high information density achieved through noun-verb torque.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence variety is high; information density strong—one line often does description, memory, and metaphor. Occasional poetic overlap (“shimmered into clarity”) flirts with redundancy but never loops. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; short declaratives accelerate the rupture, longer cadences breathe during frost contemplation. Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“smoke made of memory”) with no mixed-metaphor muddle. Information density is high: one sentence often does two jobs (“The frost wrote stories in fractal script, tales of what had been and what might yet be”). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb clusters; pronouns and tense are clean. Only a single near-repeat of “negotiable” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy accumulations and clipped fragment beats that mimic temporal shatter. Metaphors are dense yet internally coherent; no contradictory vehicles. One minor paraphrase pocket (“the shard was its only honest relic” echoes earlier “fragment of truth”) but it lands outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: staccato wound-spring sentences mimic ticking, then open into longer harmonic phrases during melody release. Figurative density is high but each metaphor is paid off—“trapped star” returns as the chip flares, “serpent of corrosion” is burned by truth—so no overwriting penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or pressure. Line-level propulsion is clean: “Eleven chimes echoed… one remained” carries both information and stakes without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sensory sentences underground, clipped fragments topside. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (needle as memory, lagoon as page) and are sparse enough to avoid purple overload. Opening and closing lines perform mirror work: “heavy with glass vials” vs. “empty pocket,” creating cadence bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate and wave-like; no template stems. Figurative layering is dense yet each metaphor drives either atmosphere or emotional stakes—“turbine-hum reverie” fuses mechanical and ancestral. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Final line tucks the slide away with rhythmic closure matching opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long amber sentences to staccato revelation beats (“Her breath caught;”). Figurative density peaks at glass vision but serves pattern, not overwriting. One scaffold loop: “quiet” appears 7× in last third— functional thematic drum but noticeable; −0.3. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density high: every postcard mention cues action. Closure image untouched by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, selective—amber reflections “danced,” bottle “a solid piece of resin”—and never muddies causality. High information density: each sentence advances image or motive. Final line’s “lantern of memory” crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “roots piercing steel grating” anchors setting and theme of persistence. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors are precise—“velvet shroud”—and internally coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motif. Minor scaffold: “the prophecy remained… wrapped in velvet” is a touch abstract, but it lands in the closure beat where abstract is permissible under Conceptual Repricing. No typos, tense slips, or pronoun drift. High density with breathing room; no purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with sentence openings varied and no template cadence. Mixed metaphors are avoided; the silk-over-steel simile is singular and precise. Information density is high—each sentence seeds image or action—yet the lyric mode justifies the occasional qualifier. A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "furious tranquility" and "wild serenity," but the overlap is intentional motif reinforcement, not artifact churn.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere, instrument reading, or interior calculus. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“rope swayed like a heavy pendulum”—never muddling causality. Rhythm modulates with wind gusts and heartbeat of data. High information density without purple overload; closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies gracefully; sentence openings avoid mechanical pattern. Figurative language is selective—“silken shroud,” “station thrummed”—and stays coherent. One paraphrase loop: “flourishing stillness” is repeated conceptually without new image between 3rd & 4th paragraph (−0.2). Otherwise dense, clean propulsion; closing line lands crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences do triple duty (“The weight of his unspoken words pressed against the glass, a silent vow kept”). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (glass/veil/light). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is justified by the lyric register. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses yield to fragmentary final lines—without artifact. Clean proofing; no tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density; single sentences do double duty (“the silo rose…corroded jewel” paints both skyline and thematic decay). No synonym loops or template cadence. One mixed-metaphor risk—“corroded jewel” (jewels don’t corrode)—but emerald/rust conflation is purposeful color fusion, not accident. Closure line clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is musical, but figurative density remains high across almost every sentence; no pattern-break teaches the reader to trust plainness. Mixed metaphors (“thread in the woven dawns” beside “brushstroke of warmth”) coexist without collision yet blur sensory channel. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or mood. Read-aloud rhythm is seductive, but cumulative opulence slightly dulls the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “copper sang against his hands, a high note that made stone pillars shiver” fuses sensory and causal jobs in one line. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances wire, body, or response. Metaphors stay consistent—orchard as synapse, wiring as grammar—avoiding mixed vehicles. Minor filter verbs appear (“he understood then”) but compress exposition without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary naturally. High density—“muted hues of a bronze quiet morning” packs color, material, and stillness in one stroke. Occasional poetic overlap (“quiet promise of discovery”) is minor purple; no loop or scaffold detected. Closing line’s “bronze resolve” avoids cliché by echoing established palette.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, sound, or stakes. Figurative layer is spare—dust like “tiny ships” once—never clogs the beat. Syntax modulates with labor: long breathless clauses during chant, staccato during gull-cry map. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences layer scavenger economy, war aftermath, and emotional stakes. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent (rusted spine, fire-colored veins). One mixed image—“wind carried a wild hush”—is earned by pattern. Final paragraph risks paraphrase repetition of “distance” but serves cadence. Clean proofing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence music varies; no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay physical—“drop of ink in water,” “ribbons of light”—and don’t tangle. One paraphrase ripple: “silence was not empty; it carried the ghost…” is immediately echoed two sentences later; minor. Opening and final lines anchor stakes and image cleanly. Peak beat at hatch is uncluttered, propelling exit.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Metaphors are vivid yet occasionally self-layered (“ice mirrors reflecting different moments in time”)—beautiful but conceptually fuzzy. No synonym loops or template cadence; scaffolding is minimal. The single clarity slip: “constellations aligning with the heart’s faint pulses” leaves physical mechanism opaque, softening the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentences vary in length and stress; high-pressure beats compress to fragments (“spelling hope”). No synonym loops or template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent: “ghost who learned to cast a shadow” marries profession to ontology. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action that recharges motif. Zero scaffolding; each sentence advances image, motion, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops, zero mixed metaphor; figurative language is sparse, deliberate, and internally coherent. High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, world rule, and emotional tilt. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges thunder→heartbeat motif. Micro-movements (“she folded the feather into a small leather pouch”) are purposeful, sealing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths ebb with reflective lulls and tighten during thread-plucking beats. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each noun is specific (“crystal,” “cobblestones,” “pawn”). One mixed metaphor—“time flowing forward like a river after a broken dam”—slightly blurs the freeze-to-flow transition, but clarity survives. Information density is high: one line often performs atmosphere, motive, and causal cue simultaneously. Closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density lines—“voices of the past that never quite died”—advance atmosphere while layering stakes. No filter-verb clusters or template cadence in peak beat; rhythm accelerates naturally into the throw. One microscopic loop: “the ritual required absolute sacrifice—was a lie that needed refracting into many” could trim one clause, but it doesn’t dull momentum or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    High figurative density sustained because every metaphor (acid sea as serpent, gears as teeth) is anchored to physical stakes. No mixed metaphors; brass-scarab-gold constellation stays coherent. Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks to mimic breath debt. Only nit: occasional adjective stack (“centuries-old statue lay in fungal repose”) could lose one modifier without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences open variedly and avoid template cadence. Figurative language is spare and coherent—“spiderweb of silver racing across the glass” is precise. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “temporary eternity” recurs with purpose, not churn. One hairline slip: “temporary eternity” is repeated four times; while purposeful, it nudges toward mantra, docking 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with escalations. Information density high—one sentence often performs setting, metaphor, and motive (“cobalt lighthouse stood breathing cool salt air, its blue stone walls still warm…”). No paraphrase loops; “vibration” recurs with accruing meaning, not synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“sky like a cracked bell”—but it is taught at opener and pays off in final bell-like ringing of intent, so coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: single sentence can solder, signal, and emotion (“Each solder joint hummed with the memory of his sister’s laughter”). No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (tide, scream, pulse). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with moon phases. Minor alliteration clusters (“silent scream”) but do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies from short surgical cuts to longer, storm-lashed clauses, propelling without drumbeat. Figurative density is high but patterned—eye as map, orchard as speaker—so it charges rather than clutters the closure. One paraphrase loop: “each secret a wound I had to bare” lands adjacent to “shard of raw honesty,” a near-self-echo that slightly dulls the peak beat. Otherwise clean: no filter-verb stacks, no scaffold, pronouns track.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm pulses like turning Fresnel lens; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective—opal, ghostly finger—never stacked. No filter-verb stacks; scaffolding absent. Single paraphrase loop: “softly persistent” repeated four times; because it becomes motif binding mist, memory, and echo, deduction is waived. Final line lands clean with no artifact intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo: short clauses during squeeze, cascading nouns in the blooming vault. Metaphors are consistent (map, light, phosphor) and physically coherent. One scaffold spot: “promise…hung…like pipe smoke” is followed immediately by “promise…hung…in the air” — a 0.2 paraphrase loop that dulls the opening line. Otherwise zero synonym-churn, no mixed vehicles, high density.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is near-immaculate: no scaffold, no synonym churn, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (texture, motion, foreshadowing). The only micro-slip is “purple into something that wasn’t quite night,” where the escaped clause slightly diffuses the visual; a sharper verb could have pinned the sky. The final image of “star embers seeking their newest sister” lands clean and luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric density is high yet purposeful; metaphoric layering (palette/pigment, star/coat, shell/lens) avoids mixed-logic collisions. One paraphrase loop—“return differently” repeated three times—dulls momentum; otherwise, each sentence advances image or ritual beat. Filter verbs minimal; strong verb choices (sparks, bloom, hum) propel. Final third clean of artifact; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm breathes with foggy pauses; high information density—each sentence layers scent-memory loss onto brass, water, screw; no loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor “landscape where grief and adaptation bled into each other like watercolors in rain” forgiven under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“ink crystallized under weight of grief” does world, body, and metaphor in five words. Metaphors stay coherent (storm/cloud/ink share fluid→solid arc). Variation in sentence rhythm mirrors breath control. No register drift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases with resonant image. Minor filter verbs (“seemed to pulse”) are voice-motivated, not clutter. Clean copy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Information-dense without clogging: one sentence fuses device mechanics, scent history, and emotional stakes (“coax the perfume’s molecules into a gentle vapor, a ghost of fragrance that could slip past the walls of regret”). Varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops; the participle “curling” is simultaneous, not sequential error. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into the single minor key, then exhales with the fading mist. Only hairline slip: “brittle rainbow” edges on poetic excess, but the image is saved by its fracture conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses build density, then fracture into choppy fragments at climax, mirroring spiral tightening. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—every metaphor (entropy’s yawn, moth-whisper contradictions) reappears in mutated form, avoiding decorative overload. No synonym loops or template cadence detected; “wanderingly exact” repeats once, intentionally. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” lexicon—stays within witness’s metaphysical idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or ritual step. Figurative language is disciplined—“razor edges” returns only when the physical key or light warrants it. One mixed-metaphor risk: “diving into a pool of glass where every edge was a possible cut” barely stays coherent but is saved by tactile payoff. Opening and final lines are sharp, echoing heartbeat/drop without redundancy.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise—clockkeeper who reverses time to learn it measures silence—is fresh, not stock. Hydraulic clock plus fjord is specific synthesis of Nordic mysticism and engineering. The backward-count mechanic is taught early and paid off in final image, avoiding late rule-change. Slight deduction for near-echoes to “razor-edged sky” tropes in eco-lyric genre, but detail is sufficiently localized to Elias’s tool-centric worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “button’s red dot danced across mycelium membranes” does world-building, tool-reveal, and motion in one sweep. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors; “curtains of living silk” extends to “funeral light” without contradiction. Sentence rhythm varies: fragment “The quiet wildfire of their realization burned without smoke” stands out yet fits accumulative pattern. Only hairline slip: “protocols that would revolutionize” edges toward hype abstraction, but immediately grounded by the next concrete image of daylight diluting bioluminescence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: languid clauses for library humidity, staccato for subway lurches. No scaffold loops; each sentence either advances hunt or deepens atmosphere. One mixed metaphor—“the city’s arteries held a secret map of chance”—survives because it’s framed as the father’s superstitious idiom, not narrator excess. Information density high: a single sentence links lantern, father, heart attack, and thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density—each sentence layers image and emotion: “glass harmonica disc spinning silently above her head” does triple duty (object, sound, foreshadowing). No scaffold loops; however, a faint template cadence (“the same voice, the same plea”) repeats across paragraphs without escalation of phrasing, nudging momentum toward lull. Metaphors stay coherent (disc as record, loop as broken vinyl). Clean copy; pronoun track never falters despite many “she” repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless sentence of climb, then short final line. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or memory. Metaphors stay coherent (jetty as “dark ribbon”). One mixed image—“weight of small moments” is abstract—detracts slightly. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence variety is high, scaffolding minimal; information density strong (“crackling fire on a winter’s eve” does triple duty—sense, nostalgia, cost). No mixed metaphors; ivy “shimmering” is single, coherent image. Loop screen clean—no synonym churn, no template cadence in final third. Opening line anchors tone and stakes; final line (“gentle rebellion against the silence of isolation”) resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory input, memory, and torque direction. Metaphors are internally coherent (constellation hinge, compass inward) and do not collide. Final line “map of quiet blaze” is crystalline, no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and plot advance (“nib bent light, rewriting small moments…”). No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or template cadence; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. Line propulsion accelerates during edit-beats, breathes during renunciation. Grammar and tense clean; pronouns unambiguous. Opening line anchors voice and premise instantly; final line resolves via image that recharges “manuscript” motif. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm is organic, sentence openings varied, no template cadence. Metaphors stay physically coherent: moon as liquid path, camera as conductor’s baton—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “promises made by men whose bones now rested beneath these same waters” layers history, mortality, salt in one stroke. One minor paraphrase loop—“silence itself” / “silence itself” across adjacent clauses—dings 0.2, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies from molten-long to staccato—“They mixed pigments. They painted faces.”—mirroring labor then urgency. Mixed-metaphor risk in “volcanic tenderness” is justified by geothermal setting and pays off in final “volcanic and unyielding” guardian stance. One paraphrase loop—“each mural… more detailed than the last”—repeats concept without new pressure, docking 0.2. Otherwise high density: one sentence can anchor place, reveal backstory, and foreshadow Fibonacci angle, keeping momentum despite lyric thickness.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers sensory cue, memory shard, and world rule. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (sound → flora → liquid). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates with approaching drone. Tiny slip: “regrets blossomed into dying chords” edges purple, but fits the lyric register and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, spare sentences with few loops; fresh adjectives ("cobalt", "crystal-click") but occasional triple modifiers ("synchronized window displays across town") feel gently overwritten; closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long cadence for tide rise, staccato for crate clash, then fluid sweep for dance paragraphs. Metaphors (whalebone glow, salt-made guardian) remain internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. High information density: “sublittoral fringe where the tide painted silver ribbons” does world-building, stakes, and body in eight words. Copy-clean; no typos or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with task: long sentences for narration, clipped fragments for knife strokes; no scaffold loops, only one paraphrase overlap (“remade hush” / “hush that would never be the same”) that serves thematic reprise. Metaphors stay coherent—turbines as scissors, shavings as confessions—without crowding the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but paraphrase loops (“dissolving boundaries… boundary between… dissolve the next boundary”) and near-synonym churn (“tremor of certainty… tremor of certainty”) dull momentum. Mixed metaphors—“lantern-moth hush” vs. “spine of frozen music”—cohere poetically, yet slightly strain logic. No scaffold sentences or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. Density is high; compression admired, but the echoing diction keeps it from 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract around furnace action, expand during plant spiral. Figurative density high but patterned: “frozen breath of memory,” “frozen breath of imperfection”—echo is taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors; glass droplet as rainbow prism stays physically coherent. One paraphrase loop: “molten glass droplet” repeated within three lines; minor, does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open with participial clauses, concrete nouns, or prepositional coils, avoiding template cadence. Information density is high: “golden shadows pooled beneath it like molasses, thickening the air until she could almost grasp the silence between heartbeats” does triple sensory/figurative/emotional duty. One mixed-metaphor risk—“handhold leading deeper into the architecture of memory”—is minor and does not touch closure. No scaffold, loops, or filter-verb clusters; every paragraph advances knowledge, intention, or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence advances image or stakes; minimal scaffolding. Figurative muddle avoided—metaphors (dying galaxy, frozen breath) stay consistent with observatory sky. One paraphrase loop (“curtains of intention” thrice in 70 words) slightly thins urgency mid-story, but it primes closure image so forgiven within tolerance. Final line earns cadence release.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose propels: information-dense lines (“black as the markets that had imploded”) do double job of color and backstory. Rhythm varies: long anaphoric cadence when multiplying paths, staccato when drops become pixels. No loops; each mention of tape/ink reweights meaning. Metaphors stay coherent—rain as pixels, cards as watersheds—without mixed logic. Copy clean.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. High information density: “dust motes swirled in the amber light that filtered through cracks in the ancient stone ceiling” does three jobs in twenty words. Occasional elevated diction (“latent energy,” “conceptual repricing” zone) slightly exceeds POV plausibility but reads as deliberate lyric heightening. Zero paraphrase loops; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is textured yet tight; no synonym loops or template cadences. Opening line anchors voice and concept in one breath. Occasional elevated diction (“metamorphose,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register. One mixed vehicle: “edges fraying like old film” beside “feeding on hope” is allowable in lyric mode without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm is supple: long sensory sentence, then a staccato instrumental clause, mirroring her inhale/exhale of shame. Only one scaffold loop—“the workshop smelled… now tainted by memory”—restates what the next sentence shows via burning brochures; a −0.2 paraphrase tap applies. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor and release with mirror-star imagery that recharges rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid, with purposeful repetition that accretes meaning rather than loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“displaced miracle,” “meteor hush”) edges toward lyric purple, but pattern is taught early and paid off. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. High information density per sentence; clauses layer time, body, object. Final third remains clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Theater below played final week—empty seats, hollow music” fuses setting, stakes, tone. Figurative density is high but patterned—film-snake, love-star, map-skin—taught early and paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt unused love accumulate”) they serve psychometry frame. Minor scaffold: “forgotten lyrics searched tune” phrase repeats twice; cycles are adjacent but serve accumulative cadence, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density is high but patterned early (“ink run dry,” “starlight ghost”) so it reads as taught texture, not clutter. Occasional soft repeats—“stardust,” “shadowed rapture”—used for incantatory effect rather than synonym churn. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final paragraph propels without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image or rule (“glowing dune grew legs and walked”) without scaffold. One paraphrase loop risk—“memory of a memory”—but it serves thematic echo rather than padding. Metaphors stay internally coherent (quantum foam, butter sun) and culminate in charged closure image. No artifact touches the final beat; rhythm modulates from long breaths to cracked fragments effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    High figurative density but pattern-taught early—“copper leaves chimed”—so metaphor reads as world-rule, not ornament. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay mechanical or arboreal. Sentence variety follows breath: long accumulative clauses build to short crystalline close. One paraphrase loop: “the probable miracles became certainties, each one a note…” but loop is thematic reprise, not scaffold, so minor.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are lean, metaphor disciplined: “heartbeat echoing the hollow surf” does double sensory duty. Occasional template cadence (“step by indirect step”) appears but pattern-teaches the mantra; no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Read-aloud rhythm ebbs and returns like surf.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long snow-mourner sentence vs clipped “She stopped. She could report it.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (snow as mourner, bolt as relic) and don’t stack in high-pressure beat. Opening and closing lines bookend with blue/iron coldness, giving circular snap without forced symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses mirror slow time, then short beats (“A gasp escaped his lips”) accelerate unraveling. Information density high—each sentence layers image, stakes, or causality. One mixed-metaphor risk: “threads of silver unraveling like a worn tapestry” beside “divine hammer” but physical logic stays intact (glamour ≠ cloth). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final third clean, allowing 9-band approach.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is spare yet musical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are disciplined—tide as breath, atlas as anchor—without mixed collisions. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts carry knowledge or emotional charge. One near-purple “white shroud” is forgiven for imaginal economy. Read-aloud ear test passes: the tapping cadence propels without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyric yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles (rose/amber suns, thunderous serenity) stay coherent to sound-and-light physics. No mixed metaphors; redundancy limited to two “bare feet” within 30 words (−0.1). Information density high: one sentence = sensory cue + emotional register + plot advance. Rhythm modulates with sonic crescendo without algorithmic pattern. Closure line clean, image-driven, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances climb, decode, or unseal. No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrases (“crystalline cage,” “conceptual repricing”) flirt with purple but occur at beats where mythic height is earned, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; no filler: “photo seemed less crumpled” does triple duty—shows change, implies cost, recharges motif. Metaphors precise: “pearl of stillness” links grit-to-nacre biological process to grief layering. Sentence variety: participial openers timed to emotional breath; no template cadence. High information density: single clause can anchor time, body, memory (“salt wind, her laughter”). Copy clean; pronoun antecedents unambiguous. Read-aloud rhythm varied without algorithmic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is dense yet lucid: “dust motes became stars, then dust again” compresses cosmic scale into a blink. No mixed metaphors; lighthouse = needle, thread = timeline, ache = light—all cohere. Scaffolding absent; no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent exhaustion”) is justified by Elara’s artistic register and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is loop-free, rhythm varied; sentences open with changing parts of speech. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“quiet fire,” “ghost of a vanished drone”—each image recharged at closure. One mixed metaphor: “ink’s ephemeral pattern glowed…stone beneath it seemed to waver, as if reality itself were a mirage” compresses two vehicles, but the waver is physically tied to the ink’s chemical shimmer, preserving clarity. No scaffold or synonym churn; information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Almost every sentence doubles duty—image + pressure: “she used the sandbag scrap as a counterweight to clear them.” No scaffold loops; metaphors stay physical. A single purple phrase—“perfume a quiet fire”—is earned by prior temperature imagery. Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate, varied.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and syntax; information density is high without scaffold. Figurative chain (“honey and grief,” “smoke made of midnight and milk”) is sustained but coherent, never muddling causality. One paraphrase loop (“transliterated her resolve… transliterated her purpose”) lightly dulls propulsion; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long gravitational sentences and short stellar bursts—“the nib was sharp enough to draw blood.” No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances image, stakes, or causal link. Figurative language is patterned (celestial mechanics) and therefore coherent rather than purple. The only micro-slip is “echoing observatory” used twice within sixty words, a hairline repetition that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence clusters tighten under pressure without algorithmic sameness; high information density—each sentence layers ink, sound, time-fold—yet remains clear. No mixed metaphors; cosmic dust / dark membrane / moth wings stay inside acoustic/visual field. Only micro-loop is intentional (“star by star” reprise to signal fabric tear). Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lilac unease,” “emergent hush,” and “chalk fossils” each do double duty for atmosphere and stakes. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor—“violet mist” vs. “lilac unease”—is minor and does not touch closure. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: one sentence often does image + interior + forward motion (“The tessera glowed faintly, as if acknowledging the burden…”). Metaphors are spare and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional template cadence (“The plaza… The wind… The city…”) is purposeful, teaching an incantatory rhythm that peaks in the final paragraph. Minor scaffold: “retrocognitively trapped” is repeated verbatim; clipped at −0.2, leaving high-band clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned and taught early (“applause that painted the darkness”) and paid off in the final “rising nostalgia that healed.” High information density: “petals that chimed like glass bells” fuses sound-touch-visual in one stroke. No mixed metaphors; cadence accelerates then softens to mirror echo fade.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, scaffold-free, with high information density: one sentence often layers scent, light, and emotional valence. Figurative language is restrained; when it appears (“frozen auroras,” “willowglass hope”) it is pattern-taught and recharged at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is POV-consistent with Lina’s analytical bent.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density: single sentences often fuse tool, sensation, and metaphor ("heat signatures of feelings, a faint glow revealing lingering warmth"). No synonym loops; occasional elevated diction ("topography," "mineralized") is justified by mapper POV. One mixed-metaphor stub—"map of longing that pointed deeper into the cave's throat"—but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rhythm varies: opening lyrical cadence yields to short shovel sentences, final paragraph lengthens into release. One paraphrase loop—“five years of constant touch / five years of accumulated silence”—but it is thematic refrain, not artifact. No mixed metaphors, no thesaurus drift. Minor scaffold: “the means to fix what he’d shattered” states what excavation shows.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “rain gutters that ticked above the tollhouse” does triple duty—timepiece, mood, and eventual silence. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor paraphrase loop near midpoint (“promise had been…promise retains…promise dissolved”) but it does not touch the closure beat and is within the −0.4 non-closure tolerance. Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts are purposeful; read-aloud rhythm holds without algorithmic patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from long clay-smooth flows to em-dash flickers; no template cadence. Figurative layering—“sun patterns as mantras,” “hive boxes slumped like exhausted pilgrims”—remains tethered to Kai’s worldview, not decorative. One paraphrase loop: “survival isn’t just endurance, but the active practice of care” restates the already-shown bowl offering; a −0.2 ding is enough, leaving propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The gauge’s tooth had once traced the depths of keys, but now it scored soil” advances both backstory and present action. Metaphors stay coherent—moonlight as cathedral, asphalt as canvas—without mixed vehicles. One near-loop: “rhythm of oars in water” repeats; because it is taught early and echoed at closure as earned stasis, it reads as pattern, not scaffold. Zero filter-verb clusters; props track cleanly from pocket to dirt.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense yet agile: stacked metaphors (“brittle awakening,” “temporal tides”) are patterned early and paid off, so figurative layering feels earned, not purple. Repetitive stems (“she feels… she begins… she records…”) create mild template cadence mid-text, dulling momentum before the final paragraph recovers variability. No paraphrase loops or simultaneity errors; clause order stays lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, stacked metaphors kept in check by spatial grounding. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she imagined,” “she realized”) dull immediacy in two beats; final third stays clean, so 9+ is disallowed but craft remains polished.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “celestial tricksters embedding infra-linguistic commands” does triple duty (character worldview, world rule, stakes). Rhythm flexes—long sentences for late-night calibrations, staccato for switch-flip climax. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “starlight in fog” is single, coherent. Minor scaffold: “the ethereal grit of the situation crystallized” is abstract summarization, but it is one line and does not recur near closure. No loops, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence runs. Information density high: one line can do setting, emotion, and causality (“The organ's crescendo peaked... and in that sonic tempest, she saw a faint outline of a door”). Only minor scaffold: “the city began to stir” is external filler; cutting it would sharpen. Metaphors stay coherent (organ as ghostly guide, stone as breathing foe) without mixed logic. No artifact touches closure; final line is image-driven and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences do double duty: “She drew the silhouette where a face should be, then lanced it with the details she couldn’t visualize” advances both process and metaphor. Figurative language is selective, never stacked; mist “like breath on a mirror” appears once and pays off when mist lifts. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic echo without feeling engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variance is natural; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—“spongey dread like wet wool” is sensory, not purple. Information density is high: one sentence often toggles action, setting, history. The closing paragraph’s dry/certain flame vs. damp fog is a crisp, non-muddled metaphor that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: anaphora “each note… each silence” accelerates tension; final paragraph lengthens to mirror song release. High density: single sentence often does scene-work, emotion, image. No loops or synonym churn; “pixelated” recurs with evolving meaning, not artifact. Mixed metaphors absent. Minor scaffold: “luminous disbelief” repeated; slightly abstract but ties to closure, forgiven. Closure image (“wrap danced in time”) crystallizes without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences fuse star data, bodily response, and mythic time. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles (star-heartbeat, telegram-parchment) stay coherent. One possible over-write: “finger accusing the darkness” risks purple, but it opens the piece and sets the accusatory frame that closure absolves, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: each sentence advances image or causality—no loops, no scaffold. Rhythm modulates from liquid spirals to hard cracks, mirroring ice fracture. Metaphors stay internally coherent (maelstrom of dead fruit, blade-before-strike). Minor register bump—“malevolent light” is familiar diction—but does not obscure closure. Clean grammar, zero paraphrase churn.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate across sensory and metaphoric beats. High information density—“leaves still warm with captured sunlight” does triple sensory, symbolic, causal work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“constellations yet unmapped”) fits POV ambition. Final line lands clean, recharging “root and branch, scar and dream.”

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional echo-word repetition (“echo” itself) is pattern-taught and pays off, justifying the mild redundancy; no mixed metaphors or loops impair closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is almost loop-free; “trembling bark / trembling branches” is deliberate echo, not churn. High density per line: “knowledge fruit seed, pulsing with copper light against her methodical fingers” does world, object, character in one stroke. Metaphors (magnetic attraction ≈ gravity of memory) are consistent with arbor physics; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: one sentence often does object, metaphor, and world-rule (“bamboo darkened but did not burn, crystals softening like amber, data bleeding into reeds”). No filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Mixed metaphors (“tidal memory,” “winter-sun serenity”) are coherent within hybrid POV; no clarity loss at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long clause clusters build cathedral image, then clipped fragments mimic heartbeat. Information density high—“velvet box containing a single cultivated pearl—perfect, lustrous, and impossibly serene against the surrounding decay” does four jobs in twenty words. No mixed metaphors; all vehicles (ribs, braille, lens) stay within corporeal/optical family. Scaffolding is minimal; only two near-filter adverbs (“seemingly,” “barely”) and both serve voice. Final line cadence lands on monosyllabic punch—“they deserve”—recharging prior motifs without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally high density: sentences layer sensory, metaphoric, and emotional work. Filter-verb clusters (“felt,” “seemed”) appear but are voice-motivated under drug-heightened uncertainty. Mixed metaphor watch: “stain of a night” beside “river swallowed the bridge” stays coherent within water idiom. Repetitive construction “each…each…” is limited to one cadence and serves ritual effect; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful variation; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence detected. Information density high—each line layers atmosphere, object, and concept. Figurative language is selectively applied; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor scaffold: "cautious exuberance" is repeated verbatim three times; while thematic, it edges toward paraphrase loop (−0.2). No synonym churn or filter-verb stacking. Final line lands clean. Overall propulsion sustained; minor tightening would reach 9.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence music is generally varied, but recurring “velvet/dewdrop/whisper” clusters flirt with over-indulgence in a 700-word space. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay organic. Information density is high—every line advances image or stakes—yet occasional scaffold appears (“She poured…letting the dark liquid settle into patterns that might reveal…”). No artifact touches closure; final paragraph lands cleanly. Paraphrase loops are minor, not systemic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm breathes with ritual: long sentences for vigil, staccato at capture. Figurative layers are sparse and pattern-taught—cosmic static, silver thread—so no density penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-charge motif: “radiant hush” → “winter jasmine bloomed forever.”

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: single sentence advances bark-bite, callus memory, and cloud-sea metaphor without scaffolding. Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences for climb, staccato for snip. No paraphrase loops; “scalloped” returns only when meaning reweights. Mixed metaphors are purposeful (milk/cloud, serpent/vine) and resolve in final jam image. Zero passive voice; strong verbs anchor: “traced,” “pooled,” “cracked.”

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rhythmically alive: varied sentence openings, paragraph breath, and metaphor that stays physically coherent (“light split into a spectrum that painted the walls”). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density is high; each sentence layers image, atmosphere, and concept. One strained metaphor—“lighthouse light a pale eye blinking”—is permissible. Closure image is crystal-clear. A single filter-verb cluster (“I realized that…”) is minor and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or synonym churn; each ripple reference accrues new informational weight. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously: “The meditation platform hovered above the still pond.” Sentence variety mirrors cardiac rhythm of grotto—long sentences swell, then fragment as Mira dissolves. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and physically coherent: “starlight silver on the surface” never breaks the water’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphors are organic to geology and acoustics. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates to match harmonic layering. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal fabric,” “sacrilege”) stays within mystic register and is earned by voice, not overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers physical detail, world-rule, and emotional state. Rhythm controlled—mist ascent flows, summit snaps to brittle fragments. No paraphrase loops; metaphors consistent (“needle of frozen crystal,” “cathedral of dying light”). Final line lands clean without scaffold or sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sentence variety propels: opening compact metaphor, later elongated clauses mimic wave sway. No loops or scaffold; each line advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—lantern flame “flickers in a language only he could hear” maintains synesthetic rule. Final paragraph cadence echoes heartbeat, closing image clean.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: single sentences fuse world, body, and stake (“coins…fossilized reality, minted from timelines”). Figurative language is patterned (frequency/wavelength motif) and never muddies causality. Zero loops or synonym churn. One tiny scaffold: “she needed to understand…more deeply” could be cut without loss, but it occupies low-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; sentences layer wax, light, and grief without scaffold. Occasional poetic stacking (“patterns of broken gold”) is justified by atmospheric beat. No mixed metaphors or loops; pronouns and tense stable. Opening anchors voice and stakes, final line recharges mirror motif.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “cracks glowing faintly with contained starlight” does triple sensory job. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances bell, drip, or mage state. Mixed-metaphor risk in “cosmic imbalance” is saved by concrete payoff in fish flicker. One near-repeat: “silence felt wrong” and “silent sea” appear close, but the echo serves the acoustic motif, not sloppiness.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentence variance strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. High density: glass glint, label peel, photo shimmer, lantern cast—each line doubles duty (image + motive). Metaphors stay coherent: mirrored hush, perfume of resurrection—vehicles match water-and-memory logic. Clean grammar, no scaffold; opening and final lines anchor and resolve by image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences layer image upon image yet propel via anaphora and progressive disclosure. High figurative density risks overwriting, yet pattern is taught early and culminates in starlings = visible music, justifying lushness. No loops or scaffold; information multivalent. One proximity issue—“color between heartbeats” pushes abstraction but fits POV. Closure line clear, echoing earlier spiral motif.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but mild scaffold loops recur: “the watcher’s burden” / “soundless echo” each appear 4× without new inflection; “pattern seeker” echoed in opening and close feels template-tag. Metaphors stay coherent (tether as lifeline, stars as eyes) yet verge on stock. No mixed vehicles, but density of figurative filler in climactic beat dulls impact. High information density otherwise—each sentence layers sensory + operational data.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“liquid time,” “silver-blue veins”—and never clusters during peak beat. One paraphrase loop detected (“emptiness and form” restated) but does not touch closure. Strong verbs (stabbed, dissolved, arced) carry load; minimal adverbs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “integration” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variance and information density are high; most lines twin-job (advance + image). Occasional soft repeats—“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal avenues”—serve accumulative pattern, not loops. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clauses. A single paraphrase loop (“safeguard this space for innovation” vs. “safeguard the space for innovation”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Highly figurative but patterned early (“choir of broken kazoos”) so read as taught, not clutter. Information density high: one sentence often does memory + sensation + choice. Few filter stacks; occasional adjective coupling (“mournfully eager,” “weightless shush”) yet compressed. One paraphrase loop: “macerate ... hard silence ... calcified” ideas repeat across two adjacent sentences; small drag. No mixed metaphor; closure sentence clean.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density—each sentence layers frost, memory, metaphysics without scaffold. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ice = unreadable glyphs). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mirror mist-thickened perception; end-stopped fragments mimic claw taps. Minor loop “waiting was…” appears three times; because it is clustered in closing paragraph it blunts the final punch, preventing 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is selective—“tree of frozen glass”—and never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes Charged Poise. High information density: “ground her mother’s ash…three drops of her own blood” does triple world-character-stakes duty.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rhythm breaths with escalation—long sentences for climb, staccato fragments for stripping gear. No synonym loops; “practical” appears twice but carries thematic payload. One mixed metaphor—“silence as presence, a frequency so pure it erased noise”—is forgiven because it is the story’s core paradox, not slop. Closure line is clean, no artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety strong; openings rotate from participial to noun-verb without drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent—“starlight pooling like silver”—and do not tangle physics. One paraphrase loop: “resiliently positive” echoed four times; no synonym churn elsewhere. No scaffold or brand lists; high information density in radio-code description. Final image line is crisp, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “sinew thread harvested from dreams of running animals” does world, character, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is patterned (water/upward/gravity) and pays off. Mixed metaphors avoided—water becomes thread becomes medium, a single sustained vehicle. Artifacts absent from closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    High density: sentences layer steel/photon/geometry metaphors without muddle; no loops or scaffold; variance in sentence length and paragraphing supports breath and climax; anchor link’s state change tracked across beats; no filter-verb stacks in pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “pulse flickers, softer than a moth’s wing” compresses stakes and sensory threshold. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as shroud, static as breath). One mixed vehicle—“pulse resolves into a name: ‘Lila’… like glass chimes”—strains physics but occurs early enough not to cloud the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers tech, body, and metaphor (“water became breathable medium became memory”). No filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Rhythm accelerates with rising water without syntactic monotony. One mixed metaphor (“ghostprints wash through augments”) lightly muddies the close but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud cadence varies; no template runs. Sentences multitask: “She pressed the porcelain shard against the terminal screen; the contact sparked a soft light, merging ceramic fracture with digital fracture.” Information-dense, no scaffolding. Metaphors coherent—ink as nerves, shard as bridge—no mixed vehicles. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new pressure or texture. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (“quiet curtain”) that recharges “opal dome.” Copy-clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is patterned early (“copper-veined storyteller,” “canyon of endless echoes”) and paid off in the final cadence, avoiding purple excess. High information density: one line can layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“the stone’s texture… flowed into her copper pathways as pure sensation”). No scaffolds, no mixed metaphors; closure image remains crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence openings vary, no template runs. Occasional stacked modifiers (“stubborn ember,” “gravitational playground”) flirt with overwriting but serve the lyric mode taught early. Zero paraphrase loops, clean punctuation, strong verbs anchor motion. Final line reprises “cosmic joke” with echoic closure that recharges prior motif.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from short cardiac pulses to longer flowing lines; no template cadence. Figurative density high but coherent—mixed-metals metaphor extended cleanly (iron orchard / clocktower / metronome) and never violates physics. Information-dense lines: “stone hand twitching, a crack appearing in granite face where tear might fall” does triple visual/tactile/emotion work. Zero paraphrase loops, zero synonym churn. Opening and closing images (ash → dust) form bookend without heavy hand. Alliteration (“resonantly soft voice”) is motif-driven, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence, propelling the launch sequence. Figurative language is spare but precise: “neon veins pulsing,” “thunderstorm in a bottle” never overwash the beat. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. One tiny filter-stack: “He watched from the arcade’s entrance…” could drop “He watched,” but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud cadence varied; no template runs. Occasional lyric inflation (“whispering gleam” thrice) risks decorative density but pattern is taught early and paid off, so penalty minor. Information density high; sentences carry dual load (e.g., “halo fragment pulsed…softened stillness”). Zero grammar flubs, pronoun drift, or scaffold loops. Final line earns its echo.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from long, sonorous accumulations to short inhalations (“She opened it”). Figurative density is high but cohesive: every metaphor is topological or bibliographic, so the system remains internally coherent. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances either scarf-phase or shelf-response. One near-artifact: “analog memories flooded the chamber—not images, but the raw weight of déjà vu” skirts abstraction, yet the tactile noun “weight” keeps it concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: staccato climb, liquid long sentences during sunrise dissolution. Information density high—each sentence advances image or causality; no synonym loops detected. Figurative language is patterned (light-bridge, liquid hooves) and consistent with dream-logic, avoiding mixed-metaphor muddle. Closure sentence “her luminous absence became gift” is clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: “unbraiding fear from follicle, untangling memory from melanin” does triple duty. Mixed metaphors avoided; star/key logic stays consistent. One scaffold detected: “across the hush of cosmic possibility” repeated twice—minor loop, −0.2. Otherwise variation in sentence length and opening; no filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud cadence supports momentum. Closure image (“ribbon’s ghost still fluttered…black as space between constellations”) lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and image-rich yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty (“He scraped spores…cultivated them…singing chants”). No mixed metaphors, though “corroded constellations” is used twice—acceptable thematic reprise. A single near-loop: “memories flooded back—not as fragments, but as a crisp nostalgia that stung his eyes” uses “nostalgia” twice in four sentences; minor. Read-aloud rhythm varied, paragraph cuts purposeful; no scaffolding or redundancy obscures closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentences vary from hushed sibilants to percussive scrapes, accelerating during annotation then slowing for pouch seal. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Metaphors stay coherent: tea leaves as “stepping stones,” shadow as “tentative hand,” all paying off in final dance. No register drift; “glyph,” “velvet pouch,” and “resonant reconfiguration” belong to her world.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from sinuous, comma-threaded loops to the final staccato of named steps. Figurative language is selective: “spectral geometry,” “figure-eight of perfect fear”—never stacked. No synonym churn; each metaphor advances either light or net. One mixed vehicle—“architecture of the woman”—is forgiven because it charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; no two adjacent sentences repeat content. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor load-bearing: “torn edge where known kingdoms gave way to blank, uncharted space” fuses geography and psyche. Syntax modulates—short clauses for video comparison, longer breathy lines for interior silence. No filter-verb stacks; “she felt” appears once and is justified as tactile verification.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new data or metaphoric layer without synonym churn. Rhythm modulates—long fluid clauses underwater, staccato notes during measurement, then a calm iambic close on the surface. Metaphors obey physics: “snow whirled around the static plane” keeps fluid dynamics accurate; no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line can do three jobs (“It mirrored the way memory fades, not linearly, but in diminishing returns”) without crowding. The final line “And Death, being Mort, simply waited for the next descent” lands a perfect cadence twist that recharges every prior image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lines achieve musical density without clogging momentum; metaphor chains (“ghost in code,” “tinkersong wonder”) recur deliberately, forming a taught pattern rather than accidental clutter. Occasional near-paraphrase pairs (“between lightning and thunder, when the air held its breath”) slightly dilute propulsion, but no loop or scaffold stalls the climax. Opening and closing images are strong and complementary. Minor overwriting nicks the score, yet the overall read-aloud ear is above 7.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Opening line anchors voice, stakes, and object in one breath: ascending / servant / goggles / calloused fingers / frozen shaft—high-density launch with zero scaffold. Metaphors stay concrete and coherent: “sunlight scattered into a thousand fractured colors” sustains ice + light motif without mixed vehicle. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances altitude or decryption. Final line cadence mirrors elevator stop: short clause, em-dash, quiet clause—rhythmic landing that propels closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative control: “metallic whisper” is fresh yet physical; no mixed metaphors. High density: “a microburst of despair so intense it fractured the cable mount” compresses cause and emotional physics in one stroke. Final line cadence—“The sky gondola held fast through the night, remembering everything”—earns its quiet beat without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: “dog-ear…folded corner marking the section on celestial navigation” does three jobs in nine words. Metaphors are clean, no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “sociable isolation defined her days…solitude she had cherished now felt like a quiet strength” – slight echo costs −0.2. Otherwise sentences vary openings; no scaffold. Final line lands with image, not explanation. Proofing clean.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or cadence. Metaphors are coherent—crystal shard, driftwood nostalgia, silver mist—without mixed-vehicle collisions. Information density is high: "a clockmaker's gear assortment, each cog a tiny heartbeat of forgotten time" fuses occupation, theme, and world rule in one stroke. Rhythm breathes with the eclipse: longer cumulative sentences build, then fracture into shorter pulses at the mirror-rupture beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length; no template cadence or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained—"sky blushed," "nebula of respite"—and does not clog high-pressure moments. Occasional soft filters ("felt the stirrings") but immediacy returns through concrete noun pairs ("calloused hands," "bronze surface"). Clean copy, no scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud ear is hypnotic: sentence length contracts as the spiral tightens, creating momentum without drumbeat monotropy. Figurative density is high but patterned—“seashells made of frozen time” teaches the conch-spiral rule that pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; cracks consistently refract light and silence. One scaffold loop—“beautifully flawed” repeated three times—feels ritual, not artifact, and survives the Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with the scene—long airborne sentences for dusk, staccato clauses for frost threat. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“frost formed on their gears” keeps physical logic). No synonym loops; each nut placement uses fresh kinetic verbs. Information density is high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tilt. Minor over-adornment in the opening paragraph keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, mirroring subject; sentence openers vary, paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative density is high but pattern-taught (foam ≈ polymer) and pays off at closure; no mixed metaphors. One near-loop: “loosened her grip … grief begin to flow rather than constrict” borders paraphrase, but the second clause shifts to river causality, escaping scaffold penalty. No template cadence; technical terminology accurate. Closing line is crisp and propulsive. Artifacts remain below −0.3 threshold and do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry triple duty—image, concept, cadence—without scaffold. Figurative layering (“stars like puncture wounds”) is sparse and purposeful, never congesting high-pressure beats. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of moonlight reweights meaning. Final line’s “anchored only by the void it filled” lands clean, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm flexes: long anaphoric clauses for sorrow-layering, stubbed fragments under droplet impact. Figurative density is patterned early—metaphors of tooth, yeast, gravity—so later coral/bread mirroring reads payoff, not overwrite. Zero paraphrase loops; each image extends prior vehicle. Line propulsion is high: every sentence adds sensory datum or causal increment. Closure line “every bite would carry the ghost of a daughter’s hand” lands clean, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentences lengthening during chorus peaks then contracting for the cuckoo burst. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each elevator refrain adds a new linguistic shard. Minor overwriting: “vigor of that tender night” jams contradictory abstractions together. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is woven through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—worldbuild, embody emotion, advance plot ("The broken mirror grew warm, its fractures mapping the synaptic pathways she had rewoven"). Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the neural/canyon conceit without contradiction. Register never drifts into abstraction without payoff. Line-level propulsion is breathless yet clear; syntax accelerates with the mirror’s hum, then exhales with the canyon’s ozone breath.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, scaffold-free; openings vary, no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent (threshold “flickering like heat haze”) and kept sparse under pressure. Information density is good—each sentence advances motion or image. Minor near-duplicates (“the mist clung… the mist thickening”) but not looped; no artifact obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—magnetic fields as board, stone as bishop—without purple overload. High information density: one clause often advances memory, stakes, and sensory ground. Final line is crisp, propulsive, and typo-free.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense: “shadows pooled like ink,” “silence that held its breath.” No mixed metaphors or loops; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated register (“varieties of silence,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Mira’s cataloguer mind. Momentum breathes with scene tempo; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose breathes: long sentences for mist, staccato for seed-grind, then open cadence for communal calm. Metaphors stay vegetal and coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional modifier stacks (“soft amber light, pulsing like a heartbeat”) flirt with purple but serve the ritual tempo. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density: “irrigation streams detached…became silver ribbons” does world, motion, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor is singular and physically consistent. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line achieves charged poise without overwriting. Minor filter verb (“she felt”) appears once but is justified as tactile epiphany; does not dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences breathe with wind tempo; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“singular convergence,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register above POV pay-grade, but clarity intact. Metaphors stay coherent; no figurative pile-ups under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lines are dense but never clogged: “the resonance unfettered wonder, releasing it from the sculpted hush” performs three jobs—action, result, metaphor—in one breath. No synonym loops; “sculpted hush” recurs with accrual, not redundancy. Metaphors stay consistent (ice = silence = weight) and converge in the cracking image. Minor scaffold: “she knew” twice near end could compress, but artifacts stop short of closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries high density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and interiority (“The gilded reed flute felt warm…humming with faint resonance”). Rhythm modulates—accumulating sibilance during flute playing, then abrupt stop mirroring the hush. No scaffold loops; however, three successive “He…then he…” constructions create minor template cadence (−0.2). Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (bruised sky, broken glass, hallway of mirrors) stay acoustically coherent. Closure image is clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences do triple duty: “The halo fragment flickered, its light now fractured, projecting a mosaic of shadows onto the ceiling” advances story, embodies emotion, and foreshadows closure. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors; star-death and fragment-death stay physically coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new visual or conceptual information. Final line is clean, propulsive, and charges the initiating image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no mixed vehicles. Information density high: “pendant against the frozen earth” does triple duty—tactile, symbolic, causal. Minor scaffold: “the years that followed” paragraph is summary bridge, but it compresses time efficiently and does not obscure closure. Zero loops, zero synonym churn. Copy clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dense lines carry triple duty: “frost painted new constellations each dawn on the windows of an ancient Volvo” seeds setting, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphors stay internally coherent—“silence rearranged” remains acoustic. Register remains within a field-scientist lexicon; “electromagnetic resonance” is accurate and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loop or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—silence as textile, amber as heart—never stacked. Rhythm modulates with loom clicks, mirroring tension. Final line shines with polished brevity: “a stone so polished by loss it could shine in the dark.”

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening spondaic crunch of “floating arches... crack” vs. liquid sibilance of “silk streamed upward.” No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or causality. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“grief turned inside-out” is single, coherent vehicle. High information density: one sentence often sets scene, reveals world rule, and tilts emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyric compression is purposeful, but three adjacent sentences open with “She…” creating template cadence; one paraphrase loop (“weight of the withheld truth” echoed twice). Metaphors stay coherent—rift as tear, shard as heartbeat—no mixed vehicles. Information density high; no scaffolding or synonym churn in climax. Final line ear test strong; rhythm modulates from long breath to clipped “next cycle.”

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lean, sentences varied, no scaffold loops; a few soft modifiers (“soft, lingering ache”) could be cut, but figurative language is sparse and coherent. High-information lines carry triple duty (action, atmosphere, emotional cue), keeping momentum through the climb, bottle, and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud ear is strong: sentence lengths crest and recede like waves. Occasional purple stacks (“emerald lighthouse under stars still kept its ancient vigil”) but metaphor logic stays coherent—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “shadowed elation, a thrill wrapped in the weight of destiny” restates same beat. No artifacts in closure; final line is clean, luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is lush but loops: “quietly explosive” ×3, “valley-mist wonder” ×2, “watchful” ×5; each recurrence adds little pressure. Mixed metaphors collide—“liquid silver” mist vs. “wind through reeds” voice—without pattern apology. Several sentences perform dual duty (image + interior), but stacks of participial phrases create simultaneity errors (“watching how the sun’s path…painted caution”). Closing paragraph uses five adjectives in a row (“iridescent caution of those shifting colors”) where a precise noun-verb pulse would sharpen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines are dense: “quantified sorrow” marries concept to image; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors (labyrinth exhales, stones absorb rain) stay internally consistent. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; each sentence advances afterimage. One hairline slip—“somewhere…already scattering” edges toward template cadence but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no adjacent paraphrase loops, metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“woven dawns” remains textile-rooted). One mixed image—“jigsaw of stars that had forgotten their constellations”—is fleeting. Rhythm varies: long clause for orchard description, fragment for fracture climax. Information density high; each sentence adds sensory or causal data. No artifacts in final third; closure image remains crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet transparent; each sentence advances atmosphere or insight (“the hush of hidden things becoming visible”). Figurative language is patterned and paid off—nested dolls, seeds, mirrors—without overcrowding any single beat. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One hairline slip: “enlarged tranquility” appears twice; the repetition is purposeful but momentarily risks cadence staleness.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero filter-verb stacks or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves” condenses time and brittleness in one stroke. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are surgical—each advances knowledge (loaf found → ritual invented → congregation formed). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “creeping beauty” motif. No scaffold; high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “He adjusted the lantern’s aperture, narrowing the beam to a pinpoint of light” simultaneously shows action, tool, and stakes. No synonym loops; “luminous vows” recurs with accruing nuance rather than repetition. Figurative layer stays coherent—light = memory = queen’s promise—so metaphors reinforce rather than compete. Opening and closing lines echo “quartz hush,” giving circular cadence without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is lean and propulsive: concrete nouns (“splintered boards,” “brass gears”) anchor every sentence. Mixed metaphors avoided; “forgotten promise” is singular and apt. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits outside POV lexicon but appears only once and does not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences deliver electoral chemistry and body response simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided—vehicles stay meteorological. Rhythm read-aloud clean. Minor purple tinge (“terrestrially cosmic”) forgiven as coined idiom taught early. Closure image crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry double duty (action + image). No synonym loops or template cadence detected. Mixed metaphors absent; “auroral sorrow” is singular, deliberate coinage. One minor scaffold: “the weight of silence” echoed twice—within cap. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, ear-tested. No artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density: single sentences do triage work (sensory, world-rule, interior ache). Zero filter-verb stacks; strong verbs anchor motion (“she touched one, and the tape hissed”). Metaphors stay within vegetal logic—no mixed vehicles. Parallax loop check clean; no synonym churn. Opening and closing lines create echo-cradle (“glass forest” ↔ “oasis of memory”) without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped fragments that echo bell strikes. Information density is high: one sentence can carry altitude physics, pigment loss, and mythic time. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line—“mute and perfect and forever new”—earns its triple adjective through prior acoustic buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or paraphrase; every sentence layers job—burn prep, magnetic data, memory pulse. Metaphor vehicles stay physically coherent (compass = consciousness, sap = tears). High-density nouns (“fossilized footprints,” “amber instead of tears”) replace modifiers. Opening line anchors voice and final line resolves by image; no scaffold hedges survive. One homophone-risky line—“a jar door promising infinite darkness”—reads as intentional double-entendre, not error.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density: single sentences layer object, history, and stakes (“silver, tarnished, with a tiny keyhole no bigger than a grain of rice”). One scaffold trace: “She began her investigation through neighborhood storytelling” is tell-ish, though immediately dramatized on the benches. No mixed metaphors; jasmine strangling mailbox is coherent. Final paragraph drifts toward template cadence (“The sandstorm had passed, leaving only calm”), a loop that blunts the last line’s punch, holding below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often layers motive, object, and motion—“the dice bore the grin of fate…” simultaneously characterizes tool, stakes, and tone. Metaphors stay coherent (dice = fate, web = cipher) and do not stack in pressure beats. One paraphrase loop “each journal entry a silken thread…she spun her own” is spaced enough to read as intentional echo. Final line lands with crystallised cadence, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops. High information density: one sentence often sets atmosphere, advances action, and foreshadows (e.g., “lanterns above burning steady…first time since dawn”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“cotton wool soaked in starlight”—is borderline but fits POV’s synesthetic bent and does not obscure causality. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence folds action, image, and world-rule (“Each placement required him to listen deeper…”). Figurative language is patterned and paid off—shadow-bridge, ink-spread hush—never crowding a single beat. Tiny loop: “tranquil blaze” appears twice without perceptual shift; not enough to dull closure. Otherwise no scaffold, no mixed metaphors, strong verb choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences carry double duty: “Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth” advances plot while echoing alchemical transformation. Figurative language is selective—meteor shower as “burning letters,” stairwell as “question mark”—never clogging high-pressure beats. No loops or synonym churn; each image extends the architectural grammar motif. Opening and closing lines act as brackets: Tuesday move-in vs. “next Tuesday” knock, creating circular propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud ear: cadence varies from velvet long sentences to clipped shell-edge fragments; no template cadence detected. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Metaphors remain coherent within garden physics; no contradictory vehicles. Only micro-loop: “tragically radiant” appears twice; second instance feels decorative, not accumulative, docking 0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—every image is ink, light, stone—so coherence survives. Information density high: one sentence often delivers sensory cue, emotional tilt, and causal push. One mixed metaphor pearl twilight “wrapping” while also “casting violet shadows” barely qualifies as strain but does not blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythmic control is exemplary; sentence length modulates to mimic breath and echo decay. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, metaphoric, and thematic work. Minor loop: “reed-blown melancholy” is repeated verbatim five times, creating template cadence that dulls the final beat; −0.4. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-anchored, propelling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong information density—“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice glowed like borrowed starlight” does three jobs in eleven words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Metaphors stay coherent within glacial/starlight lexicon. A few near-adjacent “starlight” repetitions flirt with over-patterning but do not obscure closure, so remain within −0.2 tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative layering is dense but purposeful—moon paths, firefly constellations, tea-stirred air—each image advances atmosphere or method; occasional adjectival stacks (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with purple yet stay in character, no loops or scaffold found.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences vary from sinuous accumulation to short declarative labels (“Grandmother’s Monday, 1947”), creating tidal rhythm that mimics jarred sound-waves. Figurative density is high yet purposeful; only one mixed metaphor risk (“currency of loss into something spendable”) but it is saved by subsequent concrete payoff. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density remains high with every line doing dual work (image + motive).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence rhythm modulates from ice-crisp fragments to sustained musical clauses, echoing the key’s sustained note. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances frequency, body, or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent within sonic physics—no mixed vehicles. Only minor density in the “molten coin” sunset line, but it pays off in the mirrored ice, so forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, high-density; sentences perform dual duty (“The viaduct’s hum was a low thrum she felt in her teeth, a restrained wildness…”). Occasional lyrical uplift (“aurora of disturbance in the falling snow”) is patterned early and paid off, not purple. Minor template echo: repeated “unyoke” as noun and verb approaches mantra, but the cadence supports thematic insistence rather than slackens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sentences vary in length to mimic clockwork tension; no scaffold, loops, or synonym churn. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—light through storm clouds appears once and earns its keep. High information density: each clause advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Copy is clean; pronouns track; no mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often narrates grease delivery, reveals world rule, and advances algorithm hunger. No scaffold loops; synonyms avoided. Figurative language is sparse, mechanical, and coherent—“gear-language,” “acid sea hissed”—no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by image. Minor paraphrase risk in “steadily curious” iteration but spaced enough to avoid drumbeat. No typos or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: "each byte a ghost of a voice" layers metaphor without muddle. Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. One paraphrase-adjacent moment—"the numbers continued to surface, now in the beat of forgotten songs"—echoes prior beat but adds new location, so allowed. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs. No scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm breathes with emotional crests.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with the weighted breath; no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Information density high—“memory and matter, intertwined by intention” does twin work of world rule and emotional stakes. Zero loops; final line “empathy…crystal forged in willing blood” is payoff, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong sensory density, but stacked harvest/wine metaphors in nearly every sentence create minor overwriting. “Perhaps we were never meant to be, but the memory of you lingers like the scent of late harvest wine” is evocative yet joins a long queue of scent images, dulling peak beat. Otherwise clean grammar and coherent spatial flow.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Varied sentence openers, natural paragraph shapes, and high information density—each sentence layers time strata (“pressed flowers of forgotten birthdays” packs scent, emotion, calendar). Figurative language is pattern-taught (arcs = sentences in a language) and paid off; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loop: “perceptively calm” reused thrice; each instance carries new contextual weight so penalty is hairline. Closure beat is uncluttered, crystallizing spiral of moments without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Information-dense lines: “the pattern emerged slowly, like ink bleeding through paper” does double duty linking theme and pace. No synonym loops; metaphors stay physical (amber, ink, dust). One mixed image—“gray breath” of dawn—minor, but clarified by context. Final sentence cadence varies perfectly to release tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “He pressed a finger to a rusted screen, feeling the faint vibration of a tape that never played” does triple duty—action, sensory, theme. No scaffold loops; only two near-paraphrase lines (“echo of his own aging breath” / “sound of growing older”) but they frame beginning and end, serving cadence. Metaphors stay coherent within magnetic/tidal field. Minor filter verbs remain voice-motivated. Clean enough for high-band, final third immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “metallic hiss of a broken chronometer” does world, tone, and obstacle in one sniff. Metaphors stay consistent—starlight frozen in gears, leaf whisper slices hum—no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “He waited…He adjusted…He opened” sequence (−0.2). Read-aloud ear varies sentence openings; paragraph cuts are clean. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; no artifact touches closure. Final line lands with crystalline brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description plus causal push (“Gears clicked, resonating...”). Metaphors are spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold (“She began the first loop... then the next...”) but artifacts never touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharp, book-ending with mechanical tick and drifting isle. Minor paraphrase loops inside ritual sequence (−0.2) are the only drag.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    High information density: “DNA matching the living MacLeod matriarch, carbon dating...” carries exposition without drag. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses as Elena confronts Moira, then relaxes into telescope image. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“epistemic,” “repricing”) fits character but edges toward register drift; not enough to cloud closure. No loops or paraphrase stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative layering is dense but pattern-taught early (“pearl of stillness” refrain) and pays off at closure. Occasional softeners—“seemed to hold,” “whispered of tides”—slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. No artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; every sentence layers sensorium and metaphor—“server racks transformed into garden trellises” does three jobs in eight words. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (amber/preservation, drip/patience, honey/silence). One over-ornate stretch: “green memories” flirts with abstraction, but immediately grounded by fern gesture. Final line earns cadence: “patient and unhurried, teaching its lesson…” repetition is pattern-payoff, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: single sentences perform image, emotion, and forward motion. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal data. Figurative language is dense but patterned—spiral, mist, hush—so avoids random stacking. Minor scaffold: "against the current" repeated exactly four times; because it functions as ritual chant that pays off in final line, only −0.2. Opening and closing sentences are crisp, propulsive. Proofing clean; no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the… the…” anaphora at ritual moment) is purposeful, pattern-taught. Sentences multi-task: “She placed her palm against the cool bark and, with a voice as soft as morning mist, began to sing” advances action, setting, simile. No mixed metaphors, no register drift. A single near-repeat (“golden stories” twice in two lines) is the lone hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rhythm modulates between long frost-sentence inhalations and short flare-exhalations. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances ritual or atmosphere. Metaphors are sparse and coherent—starlight as mercury, stillness as tide—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image (lullaby) without exposition. Minor hedge: “the stillness seemed to move” uses seeming filter, but the poetic license is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density: one sentence can braid condensation, marble grain, and acoustic memory. Rhythm breathes with scene—long clauses for lull, staccato fragments for tuning-fork strikes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors consistently optical/acoustic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor density slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” appears twice; second use could have been cut to let the image alone reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Read-aloud ear is musical: varied sentence openings, no template cadence, paragraphs breathe with thermal beats. Information density high—each line does setting + metaphor + micro-physics (“brass turned cold and heavy, pulling her hands downward”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; vehicles respect physical logic. Only hairline slip: “shingled hush” repeated four times in 800 words; pattern taught early and functional, but the final instance could have been trimmed to three for perfect austerity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances either texture or tactic. Metaphors are internally coherent—mane curls like smoke, peace settles like rusted copper—without mixed vehicles. High information density: one sentence can deliver scent, tool state, and memory trigger simultaneously. Read-aloud ear test passes; rhythm breathes with kettle crescendo and chisel fall, no scaffolding or filler.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. High density: “chipped paint map of my own fractured past” does triple work. Metaphors stay physically coherent (carousel frozen mid-gallop above clouds). One mixed vehicle—“voice like wind through reeds”—is earned by ghost’s otherworldliness. Closure line is crisp, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Occasional modifier stacks (“excruciatingly gentle” ×3) flirt with overkill but serve ritual emphasis and pattern is taught early. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final paragraph contains one paraphrase loop—“weight dissolve…inscribed upon her own heart” re-states release—minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: “The canal’s water mirrored the fading light, a liquid ribbon of amber and violet” does three jobs (sensorial, temporal, metaphor). One mixed metaphor: “silence…pressed against her ears” is faintly physical nonsense, but forgivable at cadence peak. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Opening line anchors voice and quest instantly; final line “a promise” cleanly recharges sundial image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentences vary from 4-word pulse (“She recorded the pattern”) to 34-word fugue of braided clauses, never settling into template cadence. Metaphors are coherent: lightning inside glass parallels latent knowledge inside rope; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high—one sentence can deliver season, tool, mythic backstory, and tactile friction. Only nit: “infinite patience” appears three times; the repetition is thematically purposeful but still noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is textured yet disciplined; figurative layering rarely stalls momentum. Occasional soft echo (“lonesome splendor” repeated) nicks perfection but never breaks pattern. Read-aloud rhythm supports the accumulative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm is musical, sentences vary; however, “bitterly sweet” / “bittersweet” recurs four times, creating synonym loop that dulls final beat. Metaphors are coherent—egg “remembered the sun it would never see”—but stacked in climax paragraph. No scaffold sentences or template cadence. Information density high; each sentence advances image or motive. Loop in keynote adjective prevents 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: one sentence often carries image, emotion, and backstory (“Maya stood…arsonist’s daughter, yet she chose to quench”). No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Final line “carrying the coin, the thread, and the song” is crisp propulsion, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry double duty: sensory detail advances stakes while maintaining cadence. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The only micro-flaw: “dust and forgotten wishes” leans cliché, but it occupies a low-pressure descriptive beat. Overall propulsion stays clean through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: single sentences do double duty (“petals sighed their quiet way toward oblivion” = motion, sound, theme). No paraphrase loops; each recurrence of “quiet sigh” reweights meaning. Metaphors stay internally consistent—garden=computer, petal=bit, tear=upload. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” is critic-speak, not Elara’s, but it occurs in the single line of meta-closure and is brief enough to forgive.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences multi-task: “stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence” shows setting, sound, mood. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral, ribbon, weaving—no mixed vehicle crashes. Minor scaffold: “retraced another loop” repeats stem twice but within accumulative lens; does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dusk cadence; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; no scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors pendulum swing—long, then cut. Information density high: “obsidian swallowed three degrees of arc” compresses geology, breach, and metaphor in five words. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught, and avoids muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line cadence delivers a dying fall that charges the earlier “silver and still” image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high—every sentence advances image, metaphor, or action. Figurative language is selective: “silver thread like a tear” recurs and pays off. Minor scaffold: “tenderly organized shelves / tenderly organized testament” is deliberate echo, not loop. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clutter; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses mimic lattice-branching, then clipped declaratives mirror council release. No paraphrase loops; “obsidian spire rose like a cracked black tooth” is the only simile and it earns its place. One mixed metaphor risk—“pen poised forever above the blank page of tomorrow”—but the conceptual twist rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to staccato fragments (“Night deepened.”) without algorithmic pattern. Figurative density is high but purposeful, reinforcing musical texture; no mixed metaphors. Minor paraphrase loop on “dust” imagery subtracts 0.2, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense but propulsive: each sentence layers evidence—“ash falls above, saltwater below.” No scaffold; no synonym loops. Metaphors are few, exact: “human teeth doing the devouring” marries time and genocide. Filter verbs absent; action verbs drive. Read-aloud cadence accelerates during filing, then subsides into dripping echo—rhythm matches stakes. Closure line is lean, unadorned, unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is largely clean; metaphor vehicles stay within carpentry or acoustic domains, avoiding mixed imagery. One minor paraphrase loop—“subtract noise until only one true note remained” surfaces twice in adjacent paragraphs—costs a sliver. Syntax varies responsively; paragraph cuts land on image beats rather than exposition. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in high-pressure beats. Proofing perfect; pronoun reference stable across the choral mass.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphors are disciplined: corrosion→bleeding orange, vines→dormant synapses, no mixed vehicles. Sentence density multi-tasks: “silver light poured through cracked glass, illuminating freshly turned soil” does setting, plot-clock, and symbolism in one sweep. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Read-aloud rhythm varies cadence to mirror bud-burst crescendo then quiet satiety.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty—description seeds causality: “ceramic spires still humming” foreshadows later re-activation. No paraphrase loops; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Metaphor chain (honey, nectar, amber) stays coherent because it maps to one physical substance—crystallized lightning. Minor scaffold: “she struck another match, watching the flame write secrets on the air” edges purple but pays off the riddle’s earlier flame-writing, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry double duty: “glass remained warm, its violet hue leached from the poisonous flowers” fuses sensory detail with causal origin. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor extends the mineral-aqueous lexicon without contradiction. Peak beat (“stone lips cracking”) uses monosyllabic clang to enact fracture. Minor near-repeat of “thread by thread” is earned thematic reprise, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable: “smog-choked city… saffron quiet” carries two sensory jobs. One paraphrase loop on “quiet” in closing paragraph costs −0.2; otherwise no scaffold. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—moonlight as lantern, ink as starlight—without mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“catalogued,” “crushed,” “roused”) reduce need for adverbs.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description advances stakes (“lantern flickered with a hunger”)—no scaffold. Figurative language peaks only twice, both paid off (hunger stone cracking, beam flaring); no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image without exposition. Minor paraphrase echo: “slow exhale of low tide” repeated; trimmed 0.1 for loop, but does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty (action + sensory filter) with varied rhythm; no template cadence runs. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, paid off (oil, smoke, glass). Minor scaffold: “flickering entities that filled the corridor” could compress, but does not obscure causality. Opening and closing lines bookend with propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo: clipped during strikes, elongating during ripple decay. No loops, no scaffold, near-zero adjectives—nouns/verbs shoulder load. Mixed-metaphor risk in “lullaby with teeth” is brief, paid off by storm’s bite of rain. Micro-blemish: occasional “fractal generating” noun pile feels textbook amid lyric flow; −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative control tight—“spirals within spirals, a cartography of madness”—without metaphor sprawl. Information density high: one sentence can stage, describe, and emotional-rotate (“She brought it to her lips anyway…”). Occasional Latinate elevation (“catalogued,” “calcium geometries”) fits cartographer mind. Final carve line lands clean with no syntactic drag.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean, readable prose; occasional template cadence (“each rusted rail… each cracked window”) but no loops scar the closure. Metaphors stay consistent (ivy/veins/petals); one mixed moment (“railway station stood swallowed by ivy, its iron ribs wrapped in green veins”) barely clouds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “Salt water had dissolved the mortar, but not the ambition that had raised these arches” advances both setting and theme. Figurative layer resists purple drift; every metaphor (barnacles blooming where dancers spun) stays physically rooted. No filter-verb clusters, loops, or paraphrase stacks; opening and closing lines are propulsive. Minor repetition of “interlaced absence” twice but cadence justifies thematic threading.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long clauses for submerged calm, staccato for lantern fix. No scaffold loops; only one near-paraphrase (“reclaimed stillness” iterated) but it accrues meaning. Figurative language stays sparse and accurate; no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density; sentences multitask. No loops or synonym churn; figurative layering dense but coherent—geode = memory vessel sustained. One mixed-metaphor risk: “atomic rage” for breakers, but fits overheated techno-poetic register. Final third clean; no artifact touches closure. Occasional elevated diction (“intangibly tangible”) is voice-motivated, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: single sentences layer sensor readout, emotional flicker, and mythic time. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay coherent (“orrery’s shadow loomed like a spider’s web”). Final third keeps clarity; no artifact touches closure. Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elegant density: “tide-polished driftwood lay scattered like broken sentences” performs three jobs—image, character metaphor, setting. Sparse scaffolding; only minor echo (“weight” used thrice). One mixed metaphor (“guilt rose like a tide” alongside “weight of silence”) but does not occlude closure. No loops in final third; read-aloud cadence varies.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentence craft is lean and propulsive; only two near-echoes (“the space between...”) and one stock pairing (“bitter past / wiser future”) intrude. Metaphors are spare and consistent—moon as scythe, mist as furrowed hush—without stacking. Information density high: one line often delivers atmosphere, bodily cue, and ritual rule. Final paragraph cadence slows to match the tide’s turn, earning the resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry double duty: “The tide would take it, or it would stay, and either way…” compresses consequence and acceptance. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—poles as “rusted sentinels,” compass “remembering”—without crowding. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: single sentences layer memory, scent, color. No paraphrase loops; metaphor (“lake itself could shatter yet endure”) coherent. Minor register drift toward lyric Abstract (“new trajectory”) but stays within POV lexicon. Final line anchors cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops: no synonym churn or paraphrase restatement; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. figurative language is sparse and patterned—scent as “small sun in the dark”—so density feels earned, not purple. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one stroke; final line resolves by image (“constellation of memory”) that recharges earlier motifs. Tense and pronoun reference remain immaculate across the lyric stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies strategically—caesura created by semicolons mirrors breath of mist; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned early (“liquid obsidian”) and paid off in closure, so −0.0 under overwrite checks. No synonym loops or scaffolding; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One micro “choking beauty” echo appears twice—acceptable as deliberate motif reprise, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Metaphors are disciplined: ”edges curled like grief itself” is specific, not decorative. No mixed metaphors; gravity logic stays intact. Rhythm varies: long sentences for archive sorrow, fragments for needle punctures. One paraphrase loop spotted—“each stitch… each thread… each photograph”—but compressed within two lines, forgiven because it creates mantra effect. No artifact near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Exceptional density—single sentences layer sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Metaphors are coherent (lava = breath, bugs = stars) and never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new pressure. Minor overwrite: “vibrant silence” appears twice; does not dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory detail, backstory snippet, and forward momentum (“She had cleaned it weekly, noting how each gear's tooth count matched the fort's forgotten schematics”). Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Peak beat (powder chamber reveal) uses spare, concrete nouns, no purple. Minor −0.1 for two near-simultaneous participle openers mid-story; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify, no template cadence. Information density is high—single sentences fuse image, motion, and metaphor (“silver thread connecting each painted stone”). Metaphors remain coherent: star dust “remembered the cosmos” aligns with its cosmic origin and reaction to aurora. No synonym loops, scaffold, or paraphrase clutter. Final line is crisp and resonant, fulfilling opening’s “borrowed dawn.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm breathes with storm: long rolling clauses build, then fracture into white scars of fragments. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay internally coherent—storm as rarefaction, scars as constellations—no mixed vehicles. One scaffold trace: “furiously tranquil” appears twice; second use could compress, but closural placement justifies echo. Read-aloud ear test passes; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language (kaleidoscope, hidden overture) stays tied to focal interests. No scaffold loops, mixed metaphors, or over-decorated clauses clog the duel beat. A slight over-reliance on participial openers (“turning each restless moment…”) softens propulsion; tightening two lines would elevate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for starlight, staccato noun phrases for nail scavenging. Metaphors (garden cracking pavement, silver fracture) recur with earned variation; no mixed vehicles. Information density high—one sentence can layer scent of rust, whisper of pages, and risk of discovery. Zero paraphrase loops; opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero paraphrase loops, varied cadence, strong verbs (“spill,” “rattled,” “swayed”). Metaphors stay coherent within the musical/clockwork lexicon. One hairline slip: “the horizon began to bruise” edges purple, but the image is brief and motivates the storm, so artifact penalty is minimal (−0.1). Closure line “the music remained… etched into the wind” lands clean, no figurative muddle. Satisfies the 9+ quick test for zero line-level debris in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—“memory-light, each photon a story”—never overwrought. Rhythm modulates from long, speculative cadences to the staccato of “the ridge shuddered.” Opening and closing lines frame and resolve the voice-stakes contract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional mist, then tactile nouns (wire, moss, lapis). Figurative density is high but patterned early—lace diffusion taught by 25%—and pays off in the leaf-tip image. Zero paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; information dual-loads action and atmosphere without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Dr. Elena Vance stepped…”, “A monarch butterfly lay…”, “She had come…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent (dust as archive, drama as prism). Minor overwriting in “preprocesses reality into spectral patterns” slightly strains, but clarity at closure remains intact. High information density without momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with high information density (e.g., “frost... glittering like shattered glass” merges setting and character lens). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “purpose might lie not in vengeance, but in quiet pauses” → “wanted to discover purpose in the pauses” risks loopiness. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in mid-story (“He understood... He wanted... He realized”) slightly dulls propulsion, though closure remains sharp. No artifacts obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“frost painted the panes,” “anger burned a sharp red”). Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph (“cathedral of unshaken marvels”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift mar peak beats. Closure image remains sharp despite one ornamental phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with layered meaning (“wrinkles of silt and sorrow” conveys age, labor, and emotion in six words) and avoids loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor overwriting slip: “distress signals... spoke directly to marrow” leans slightly metaphorical but is grounded by context. No filter-verb stacks, synonym churn, or simultaneity errors. Final line (“silence that would never quite catch them”) perfectly encapsulates tone and theme with zero redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: “vine-laced roof had witnessed five years of sanctions” compresses time, ecology, and politics. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual breath. One paraphrase loop: “quiet lifeline… amplified quiet” borders on redundancy. Figurative language is controlled—“patina a map of memories” works—but “beacon of intergenerational hope” in final line veers toward abstraction. Otherwise, clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Fog curled around iron rails, softening edges into ghostly whispers” establishes setting, mood, and POV bias). However, minor figurative stacking appears in high-pressure beats (“a gentle storm of feeling,” “blooms glowed like embers”), risking slight density overload. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the climax restate the release of love with minimal new pressure (“She let the unused love flow back… The viaduct seemed to sigh…”). Still, rhythm varies naturally, and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “chlorophyll and light,” “quaking reverie,” “fibrous as mycelium” do triple duty. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“infinite surface area within finite boundaries”) slightly bogs momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“fading photographs materialized… photographs aged”) costs 0.1—but closure remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“His chains, though still heavy, are now a ladder”) and avoids scaffold. Figurative language is consistent (musical/chained motifs) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in two peak beats (“staggering grace,” “green rebellion”) that edge toward label-like phrasing, and one paraphrase loop (“resilience… seeds of hope” echoed too closely). Otherwise, rhythm, clarity, and propulsion excel.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent—trust’s breakage as “glass screaming underwater” aligns with the aqueous setting. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“battered cathedral of rust and salt”) slightly dilutes momentum, but peak beats avoid muddle. Final paragraph’s cadence (“pure and terrible and complete”) delivers resonant closure without scaffold. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally over-ornamented (“luminous disbelief” appears three times, verging on refrain-as-scaffold). Most sentences advance atmosphere or action, yet adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“portrait seemed to shift… reinterpret the image”). Figurative coherence holds—moonbeams as liquid, light as thread—but the phrase “fleeting golden sunset” repeats with diminishing returns. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters slightly under stacked clauses, though rhythm largely serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“the crack ran jagged across the middle, as if the material itself had finally given in to grief”) and varied syntax that accelerates during glassblowing sequences. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. One minor density issue: the phrase “safe zones for inquiry” appears twice in close proximity, slightly diluting impact. Otherwise, figurative language is coherent (thaw = emotional unclenching), and the final image lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs (“hissed,” “crackled,” “threaded”) and varied sentence openings. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “rusted library under stars that seemed to watch her every move” blends mixed agency (stars watching). One paraphrase loop: “trembling certainty” echoes “hands trembled” without added pressure. Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative density; no scaffold or register drift harms comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: “ambered hush” appears 5 times, “marbled hush” 4—functional as refrain but bordering on incantatory redundancy. No paraphrase loops, but “silence” is rendered through near-synonymous phrases (“hush,” “quiet,” “void”) without fresh metaphorical grounding after midpoint. Final third avoids artifacts; closure image (“map a constellation of quiet”) is clear and earned. Minor deduction for slight figurative saturation in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “spectral ribbons,” “bruised purple,” “recursive moments” avoid purple excess by serving J-3’s sensorium. Sentence openings vary (“He felt…”, “J-3’s processors…”, “The courtyard’s static…”), and paragraph cuts heighten cadence shifts. One minor artifact: “amalgamate” appears thrice in close proximity (lines 14, 17, 23), risking synonym churn, but contextual necessity (core action) mitigates penalty. Closure beat (“guiding his steps toward the next moment…”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally over-ornamented: “resonant hush” repeats four times, creating a scaffold loop. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments (“truth had been etched in the tickets all along”) without muddling clarity. Sentence openings vary, though passive constructions (“was bathed,” “were scrawled”) slightly dull propulsion. No fatal artifacts, but synonym churn (“thaw mistrust,” “lifted a weight,” “thawing the silent freeze”) dilutes precision.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “each crack gleaming like a small constellation” merges image and theme efficiently. Sentence openings vary (“After the world…”, “His hands…”, “Silas believed…”), and paragraph lengths shift to mirror pacing. Minor overwriting appears in the final third (“blooming withering dance of hope and memory”)—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short staccato beats during action (“Now,” she whispered), flowing clauses in revelation. Figurative language is coherent (frost/time, wings/tapestry) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“spectral grids… possible timelines… lives the Aurelians might have lived”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure lines (“secret the universe only whispered”) redeem with crystalline clarity. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; information density remains high without sacrificing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“water lapped against music stands like a tide of forgotten melodies”) is coherent and recurring, not stacked. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary (“She stood…”, “Flickering lanterns…”, “Amid the hush…”). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors thematic shift—short, declarative, forward-moving—without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“instruments swayed with uncertain readings, reflecting the swaying certainties within her mind”). Figurative language is purposeful—aurora “bleeds,” smudge “resembles a map”—but risks slight overwriting in mid-story (“sorrowful light,” “liminal space”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. Final paragraph’s cadence (“free”) resolves momentum cleanly, though “fault-tolerant and peripherally aware” repeats label-like near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“brass beads clicking like rosary beads he didn't believe in” establishes object, trait, and tension). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Elias crept…”, “His mind held…”, “The tunnel…”). Figurative language is coherent—beads as eyes/confession booths, tunnel as artery—and intensifies without muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm (“He stood, shouldered his pack…”) propels closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “regenerative silence washed over her, mending the frayed threads of thought” border on stacked modifiers. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“crumbling peace” repeated without intensification). Yet rhythm varies skillfully, sentences advance atmosphere and theme, and the final lines achieve propulsion through poetic economy. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, though one or two metaphors verge on abstraction (“heart a silent archive”).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hush of dreaming roots” recurs with evolving weight, and metaphors stay coherent (music as bridge, curl as talisman). Minor overwriting in “beneath the linoleum and foundation and centuries…” slightly muddles cadence, but peak beats avoid figurative clutter. Sentence variety supports emotional arc; paragraph cuts serve rhythm. No loops or scaffold—each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (fire “only half-succeeded,” dreams “scattering like seed”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in one beat (“methodical patience of an archaeologist brushing centuries from a single bone”) slightly inflates without obscuring clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes momentum without loops or scaffold—closure image lands with zero artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt air would bleach the future from her bones” does triple duty (character, setting, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Inside, Mei Lin swept…” / “Tonight she found…” / “Morning broke…”). Figurative language is coherent (music metaphors: “transpose,” “orchestrated,” “instrument”). Final line’s “tide that would carry the old self away” avoids purple prose while resonating with opening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense but propulsive, with near-perfect information economy—e.g., “indigo… pigment or simply the absence of everything else” does thematic, character, and atmospheric work. Minor overwriting in “muffled clarity, where every word meant itself and its opposite” slightly muddles the paradox it describes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language remains coherent. Final line’s “shadow cast by doubt” lands with crystalline force.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally overwrites: “upturned hush” appears twice with slight variation, and “conductor of unheard symphonies” is repeated three times, verging on scaffold. Sentence openings vary well, but peak beats lean heavily on metaphor (“exhaustion curling like fog,” “horizon breathed”), risking density overload. Still, rhythm propels the piece, and the final paragraph achieves clarity despite lyricism. One paraphrase loop (“she had become… she had become”) triggers a minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“procedurally generated a door where none had been before”)—slightly redundant—but never obscures causality. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts serve emotional charge. Figurative language is consistent (light/dark, folding/unwinding), though one or two stacked modifiers flirt with purple prose without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cotton silence,” “filament of hush,” “mirrored hush” recur with evolving weight. Syntax varies effectively—long sentences for atmosphere, fragments for impact (“Backward recorded songs”). Minor overwriting in “ghost of itself, reversed” slightly muddles the peak beat, but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“seasons' soft turn”) perfectly recharges opening autumn motif.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“brimmed,” “alighted,” “prick the heavens”). However, two paraphrase loops dull momentum: “layered tranquility” appears twice within 10 lines; “solitary yet resolute” echoes “nurture integrity in solitude.” Figurative density spikes in final paragraph (“melody of defiance,” “fragile line between fact and fiction”) verge on overwriting. Still, sentence variety and sensory layering maintain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/shadow, breath/scent) and pays off in closure (“salt trails that caught violet light like tiny lanterns”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“crushing weight of preserved beauty”) slightly muddles clarity but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high even in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “passionate subtlety” and “ethically playful reverence” verge on abstract label-speak, and the density of metaphor (rope as map, wall as book, starlight as thread) risks blurring clarity in mid-text. However, rhythm varies effectively, sentence openings diversify, and key lines (“each fray a moment of decision”) land with precision. A minor paraphrase loop appears in the description of choices (“preserve the past or seize a future... both choices impossible”), slightly dulling momentum. Closure image remains sharp despite figurative abundance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere and character in nearly every line. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“fragile music, a sound both ancient and new”)—a near-tautology that slightly dulls momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines repeat “unfinished” conceptually without added pressure. Closure image remains sharp despite this small redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “honeyed light pooling on stone,” “half truths wrapped in official seals,” “shadows stretching like fingers.” Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Minor redundancy in “fuse insight with empathy” (repeated 4x) borders on scaffold, but the phrase accrues weight as mantra. No mixed metaphors or register drift; every image serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished but over-compressed in key beats. The investigation (“Days later…”) summarizes what should be dramatized. Repetition of “cautious exuberance” (twice) and “cycles of compassion” (three times) edges into motif churn. Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“melody of kindness,” “sea’s heart,” “endless as the tide”), dulling the locket’s concrete power. Otherwise, syntax varies well, and sensory detail integrates smoothly with action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “villagers moved in webs of kinship spun from ancestral glass”). Figurative language is consistent—glass/reed/light motifs interweave without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “borrowed stars,” “void of possibility” flirt with abstraction but don’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Closure beat (“glowing at the edges like the arbor’s obsidian heart”) avoids artifact penalties while delivering resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“moss that grew only during the giant’s exhalations” establishes ecology, magic, and setting in one clause). Figurative language is coherent—time as “liquid lead,” echoes as “audible fossils”—and avoids purple excess. Minor deduction: slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story could tighten rhythm, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Dawn would come… repeat in the city’s interrupted cadence forever”) earns its lyric weight without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasionally veers toward overwriting (“silver droplets into silent music,” “fractal of grief and hope”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences slightly restate the mosaic’s shift (“forming new constellations… equations flow like a quiet river”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports emotional arc, and closure image (“drip of the stalactites, a question lingered”) resonates without clutter. Minor figurative stacking in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is coherent (“sapphire-hush,” “dark arteries of the library”) and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; verbs are strong (“pried,” “cached,” “nudged”), modifiers precise (“brittle ribbon,” “hollow cheeks”). Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors heartbeat: short clauses (“She would cache another clue tomorrow. And the day after that.”) then expansive close (“something more delicate had been restored”). One minor slip: “methodical heart kept time” slightly abstracts, but cost is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The mossy trellis, alive after the rain, seemed to breathe with a newfound flexibility”), varied sentence openings, and purposeful paragraph cuts. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent sentences describing the journal leaf (“a pressed memory… a talisman”), creating slight paraphrase-loop friction. No scaffold or template cadence; figurative language is coherent (vines as teachers, trellis as arms). Final beat avoids purple prose, sustaining clarity through lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (tides as brushstrokes, rain as path) and paid off. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “haggard awe” (repeated thrice)—a near-loop that borders on motif but risks emphasis through recurrence rather than evolution. Otherwise, rhythm, syntax, and image align flawlessly with emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: metaphors (“river of certainty,” “stone she had missed”) recur with evolving weight, never contradicting. Sentence openings vary (“After the pilgrim…”, “He wore…”, “Lira…”, “Her sight…”), and paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“whisper of something unseen, a presence without form”) edges toward redundancy, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Final line’s echo (“bright darkness echoing through time”) recharges the core motif cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“hands smelled perpetually of brine and old paper”). Figurative language is coherent (mist as memory, valve as key) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual cadence matching the story’s intervals. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“negative spaces that defined a shape”) slightly dulls momentum, but closure remains sharp and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fog rolled thick as cotton,” “regrets formed buttresses,” “starlight pooled like liquid mercury” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphor in tactile specificity. Sentence openings vary (“As a meticulous route mapper...”; “Her fingers...”; “Three nights ago...”), and paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Minor overwriting in peak beat (“a sound like a thousand validated journeys”) slightly muddles causality but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical but purposeful; metaphors (“restless echo chamber,” “unheard symphony”) are consistent and physical. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“tapestry of entangled memories,” “sculpted space for reflection”), slightly diluting propulsion. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary effectively. Closure lines (“every star whispered a memory”) resonate without redundancy, though one or two adjacent descriptors edge toward stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“cursed amulet fragment... drank the storm’s charged particles”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (prisms, serpents, weaving) and pays off in closure (“refracted endings”). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“hushed thunder of the storm’s apex”) slightly blurs clarity but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold—every line earns its place, with strong verbs (“clutched,” “imploded,” “scattering”) and specific nouns (“obsidian surface,” “background radiation”).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line—e.g., “embalming fluid gurgled, a chemical that liquefies rigid thinking” merges setting, theme, and character insight. Figurative language is coherent (fluid = moral solvent; ink pot = vessel of truth) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary rhythmically, avoiding template cadence. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the ledger revelation—it’s told rather than dramatized—but closure remains undulled. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every image serves escalation or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“fluorescent lamp that flickered like a dying star” borders on mixed metaphor). Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve rhythmic breath. Minor redundancy in “invented histories” phrasing recurs without added pressure. However, information density remains high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or concept—and the final dimming lands with clarity. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; momentum sustains through poetic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “colors bleed at the edges, sounds arrive with echoes of futures that never happened” conveys setting, perception, and theme in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (memory textures → salt residue) and avoids purple excess. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm mirroring tidal ebb/flood. Minor density in mid-section (“fragments that drift like tidal debris…”) slightly slows momentum but serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary (“The observatory’s dome…”, “Elias, the last myth buster…”, “He’d come…”), rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor flaw: slight overuse of figurative density in mid-section (“weaving them into a single strand of understanding” leans abstract), but it doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; final paragraph’s propulsion is flawless. High information density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances theme, character, or setting. Figurative language is pattern-taught (fireflies → liquid sky → chipped stone → phoenix) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “mosaic of rotting wood and rusted steel” risks purple prose, but momentum holds. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (storm arrival, child’s glance).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose balances lyricism and propulsion: “crystalline bloom flared into brilliant violet, its petals catching the light like a final sigh” merges image and emotion without overwriting. Sentence openings vary (“Her visor reflected…”, “She carried…”, “The dawning hush…”); paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor redundancy in “purposefully curious” repetition (three mentions), but no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Closure beat (“captured a moment that would never come again”) resonates without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “tools hanging from ceiling hooks in a symphony of metal she knew by weight alone” conveys setting, character, and profession in one stroke. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light refraction as diagnostic tool) and payoff-consistent. Minor overwriting in “spectral lines across its damaged processors” slightly muddles the image, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mars peak beats. Final line—“true navigation belonged to those who heard silence speak”—resonates without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“rusted flanks of corrugated metal hunched beside a frozen lake that had forgotten its own shape”). Figurative language is consistent—water as writer, ice as mirror—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent lines (“The singular convergence. / Not of rivers, but of their absence”), slightly flattening momentum, but the final third maintains clarity and propulsion. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe, and the closing image (“Seven rivers flowed out, each bearing a single word: Nishan”) delivers resonant closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or method. Figurative language is purposeful (“moss grew in its cracks like old blood”) and coheres with the sonic motif. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally across paragraph lengths. Final line (“the ghost town breathed”) resolves by recharging the opening’s “held breath” with earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (“corridors snarled in dimensions that defied mapping”). Minor overwriting in “a thousand funerals, a thousand births” slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity, but figurative logic holds. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“a monument to what can be captured only by letting go”) earns its resonance without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“copperlight repose,” “reef’s jagged voice”) is consistent and grounded, avoiding muddle. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“sustain impossibilities” repeated), but no loops or scaffold dull key beats. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The hush lingered. Forever, the lighthouse stands.”) resolves with rhythmic authority. Information density is high; no wasted lines.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frosted with the breath of forgotten winters” does triple duty (setting, mood, backstory). Figurative language is pattern-taught (veil/mist, pulse/heartbeat) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “luminescent tendrils sprouted, weaving through the air like threads of starlight”—simile slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“sweet bitterness of a love that had finally found its rest”) resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“weaving ruin into reverence”) and strong verbs (“carved,” “creaked,” “bloomed”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths modulate rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “luminous thread of hope, an orchid solace” edges toward stacked modifiers. No loops or scaffolding, but “ghost-light,” “ghostly map,” “ghost chasing” verge on repetitive motif phrasing. Closure image remains clear despite slight lyric inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gnarled roots snaked between ribcages” establishes setting and stakes in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (orchard as “living archive,” sundial as “sentinel of time”) and never overwrought. Zero paraphrase loops; syntax varies naturally (questions embedded in narration: “how the sunlight filtered…”). Final line (“whispered a promise of return”) echoes the opening exile with earned closure. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “quiet” (three times), but never in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high information density: “holographic shopfronts dormant until noon” establishes world rules economically. Figurative language is coherent (arcade as “fossil of commerce,” chalk as “fragment of a language the Collective could never translate”). Minor overwriting in “surgical precision” slightly strains metaphor but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s resonance (“margins would remember”) pays off opening motif flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “galaxy-chart embroiderer” appears twice redundantly; “echoed silence” recurs with diminishing returns. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent—flame as “blue-white heart,” leaves as “whispered secrets.” However, minor scaffold appears: “She stitched faster… each pass a heartbeat” followed by “tapestry began to glow”—two adjacent lines restating escalation. Final paragraph’s “walked onward, the eternal candle lighting her path” slightly deflates the charged poise with generic closure phrasing. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“each stroke a question I was afraid to answer”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass/memory, moonlight/healing) and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (“fierce tenderness that cradled my rage”) slightly thickens texture but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional arc, though two adjacent lines (“The words were my own… loved her more”) border on paraphrase-loop.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“the silence in his daughter’s room that grew teeth”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (coral = memory, cast = absence) and never muddled; metaphors cohere physically (coral’s grooves “anchor,” mist “thickens into forgiveness”). Minor overwriting in mid-text (“neural pathways firing and misfiring”) slightly slows momentum, but closure beat (“I kept your number too”) lands with devastating simplicity. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “fog pooled like mercury,” “shard of exposed film she’d kept as a talisman,” “pensive mirth” recur with near-formulaic cadence. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“light carved a sanctuary… light-painting tools responded… danced the light”), and “pensive mirth” borders on label-speak. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and high-pressure beats maintain propulsion. Closure image remains vivid despite slight figurative density in mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“sound bewitched the mural,” “curiosity into visible breath”) is consistent and coherent within the established logic. Minor overwriting in “nested awakenings rippled through the garden as the sound sculptures caught the echo”—slightly redundant after prior awakenings. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies naturally. Final line resonates without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled—“cathedral of controlled chaos,” “vine constricting its host”—without muddling clarity. Minor overwriting in the opening (“tiny sentinel against the thought-police drones”) edges toward purple, but quickly grounds itself. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. The final line (“a seed would rattle with the sound of freedom”) lands with perfect cadence and resonance, repaying earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: metaphors stack (“fossilized moon,” “thread spun from moonlight,” “photosynthesis of sorrow”) without always clarifying. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” repeats near-verbatim). However, rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high—most lines advance theme, character, or atmosphere. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, but mid-story has slight redundancy in describing the armistice’s spread.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting (“cathedral of translucent shelves humming with the silence of extinct feelings” risks mixed metaphor). Some adjacent lines paraphrase: “preserving the sound of forgotten names” recurs with minimal variation. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional swell, but the final third accumulates slight redundancy (“fragile flame,” “soft spark,” “flickering against vast silence”). No fatal artifacts, yet minor scaffold loops prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“quicksilver ink that shimmered with trapped starlight harvested from dying languages” establishes setting, object, and theme). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional beats, and metaphors stay coherent (language as music, ink as starlight). One minor slip: “carefully reckless” borders on label-speak but is immediately dramatized by her writing act. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“extinct things could learn to sing again”) recharges the symphony motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “stone walls… throbbed with the slow, rhythmic breath of the mountain” conveys setting, atmosphere, and metaphor). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“slyly heartfelt hope,” “dappled resolve like sunlight through volcanic haze”)—elevated diction slightly clashes with machinist POV. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s lyricism risks abstraction but earns it through prior concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density (“dust motes swirled… a map of invisible currents”). However, slight overwriting appears in the final third: phrases like “blooming and withering in the same breath” and “fleeting constellations of hope” verge on repetitive lyricism. No fatal loops, but three adjacent lines near the end restate the dust-mote motif with diminishing returns, slightly dulling the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with imagery but avoids overwriting; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. However, minor paraphrase loops appear (“necessary distances must be traveled… distances are not arbitrary… distances were not just steps”) and “fractured hush” recurs with diminishing returns. Figurative coherence holds (prisms, grain, weather code interlock), but the final third leans on summary (“I realize… I understand…”) where dramatization would heighten impact. Still, rhythm and specificity remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“rust-flowers,” “carbonized to perfect crystalline brittleness”). Figurative language is coherent: leviathan/facility, fireflies/microbes, feather/constellations—all reinforce theme without muddle. Minor overwriting in “shadowseam wonder” slightly jars, but rhythm varies purposefully (long sinuous sentences for immersion, short clauses for urgency). No loops or scaffold; every image advances plot, character, or atmosphere toward the charged final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (light = emotion, foam = memory) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “iridescent tapestry woven from quartz and time” slightly strains metaphor, but clarity holds. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors tidal ebb, reinforcing closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency (“tide had crested at midnight, turning the boardwalk into a floating island”). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors, no overwriting. Sentence openings vary (“Ezra pivoted…”, “His fingers moved…”, “The cabinet roared…”), and paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. One minor slip: “calculated wilderness—Ezra’s term” edges toward exposition but earns its place by crystallizing the core paradox. Closure image (“stars witnessed his arithmetic of wonder”) lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“obsidian grace,” “language of the void”). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“cosmic verse on mortal skin” appears three times). However, rhythm varies purposefully, and sentences advance atmosphere and theme efficiently. Closure beat avoids artifacts, preserving impact—though earlier sections flirt with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwrought: “noctilucent reckonings,” “spectral shards,” “luminous design” risk purple abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“clarity and complexity could coexist… clear complexity”). Final paragraph repeats “stillness,” “stories between lines,” slightly diluting closure. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and most lines multitask—image, character, theme—without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “porcelain cool against calloused palms,” “fire crowned through the canopy.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (fire as language, scars as letters) and pays off in closure (“fracture a syllable”). Minor overwriting in “celestial bodies continued their patient waltz”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose achieves high information density: “translucent membranes filled with quantum-entangled helium” conveys concept, setting, and stakes in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (balloons as transfusions, gauge as heartbeat) and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“She had abandoned...”, “Her trial balloons...”, “On the morning...”). Final line’s “ripples across parallel timelines” echoes opening wave rhythm without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “frost-vine hybrids,” “emulsion cracked like dried riverbed”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, repetitive phrasing appears: “sensitively perceptive” used three times verbatim, and “half-burned diaries” recurs four times with minimal variation—constituting synonym churn. These loops, especially near closure (“Through the half-burned diaries, she glimpsed…” twice), trigger a −0.4 deduction. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (prisms → memories → song → mirrors) and never muddled. Minor redundancy appears in the repeated description of mirrors returning to “ordinary selves” with a “faint glimmer”—a paraphrase loop costing ~0.3—but it doesn’t obscure closure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with the action, and the final line (“In dusky harmony, the world turned”) resonates without overstatement. High information density with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, but occasional overwriting appears: “silent ballet marking the turning point of ages” borders on purple, and “weaving them into the fabric of the present moment” uses mixed textile/cosmic metaphors. No paraphrase loops, but “fragile” repeats three times in closing paragraphs, slightly dulling impact. Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “salt flat sprawled like a fractured mirror” establishes setting, tone, and motif in one image. Sentence openings vary (“Vesper walked…”, “He stopped…”, “This was the place…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. One minor loop appears in repetitive references to “echo” in the final third, but no scaffold or paraphrase loops dull momentum. Figurative language remains coherent (cracks as maps, salt as canvas), though “fragile promise of a lost melody” edges toward abstraction without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence rhythms vary effectively, mirroring dance cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“spectral colors that painted her skin”) borders on decorative but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“threads of sound”) remain coherent. Final paragraph’s momentum falters slightly with summary (“seeds of sound had been planted”), but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “watered gin beneath its cracked parabolic ceiling” conveys setting, economy, and decay).

Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence, and figurative language is purposeful. No loops or scaffolding; every image advances theme or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“clouds pooled at its entrance like shy visitors” establishes setting and tone simultaneously). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful—no mixed metaphors—and avoids overwriting; even dense passages (“each extinct pollinator erased seventeen plant memories”) serve causal pressure. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the final line (“an unresolved chord in the song of what comes after”) resonates without scaffold. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“verdant grotto steamed with respiration”), but no loops or artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “aurora light bled,” “names circled her,” “snowmelt ardor” do triple duty (image, emotion, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; rhythmic variety avoids monotony (fragments, compound sentences, em-dashes). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“ardor warming the sanctum’s frozen silence”) risks purple prose but pays off in closure (“snowmelt ardor had become a river”). Figurative coherence holds—light, ice, sound motifs intertwine without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “foresight only through hindsight, seeing tomorrow's shapes in yesterday's shadows” does triple duty (character, theme, voice). Minimal loops; metaphors cohere (vines as timelines, Archive as labyrinth). One slight overwriting in “labyrinth of maybes built from certainties”—abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery—but doesn’t obscure closure. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors release: short clauses, active verbs (“took a step,” “sighed its last”).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ghost-scent of burnt myrrh,” “schematic devotions that would outlive both his frugality and his astronomy.” Figurative language is precise (“irony crystallized,” “bridge across the abyss of political forgetting”) without muddle. Minor flaw: slight overuse of em-dashes in mid-section slows momentum fractionally. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line (“monument to what endures between the certainties of power”) perfectly echoes opening’s liminal framing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “a scheming pacifist... silence could be a weapon sharper than any blade” establishes character, conflict, and voice in one stroke. Figurative language is coherent (memory as “weight in her pocket,” resentment as “black knot in the air”) and never muddled. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in the opening paragraph (“marble... sandstone... organic that pulsed”), but no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull the closure beat. Final line (“prepared for the next shift”) perfectly echoes the opening’s temporal uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (“shattered glass mountain,” “frost on a windowpane”) and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in climax (“liquid light, flooding the frost-shrouded trees”), but clarity at closure remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rafters groaned under a weight of apple boughs” establishes tone economically. Figurative language is pattern-taught (orchard as vow-metaphor) without muddle. Minor overwriting in “wiry woman with a tongue as sharp as her chisels” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“sap flowed anew... thousand new leaves”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“watering can that held liquid memories” conveys tool, emotion, and world logic). Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato beats during tension (“He needed to inquire”), flowing cadences in epiphany. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (“blossoms opening like eyes” ties to later “constellations rearranged when unobserved”). Minor density risk in peak beats (multiple layered images during fruit-biting) but clarity remains intact; no artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent (symphonic motif) without muddle—“stone warden that fed on memory” aligns with “mute chords.” Minor overwriting in “perfume of forgotten herbs, a silent chorus that clung to the pages” edges toward purple but serves theme. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; paragraph cuts are precise. Final line (“listening for the next unheard symphony”) recharges the opening with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “vines of silver and gold curled around trellises of rusted steel” stacks modifiers without propulsion. One paraphrase loop: “fractured, a mosaic of two lives stitched together” and later “dual lineage” echo redundantly. No scaffold or template cadence, but figurative density occasionally blurs causality (“ship seemed to exhale” lacks physical anchor).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“brass gears that measured time with submarine precision” conveys setting, tone, and thematic weight). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple excess. Minor deduction for slight overuse of compound adjectives (“warmly methodical,” “centuries-old ceremonial”), but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Final line (“only clarity in acknowledging what had been missing, and why”) resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful—figurative language serves the accumulative texture. Sentence openings vary (“After…”, “She had…”, “Lira pressed…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, subtle paraphrase loops appear: “bloom of hush” is restated nearly verbatim across three climactic paragraphs, and “hammered repose” recurs without evolution. These aren’t fatal but prevent 9+; they slightly dull the closure’s novelty despite strong propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (glass/shards/silence) and pays off without muddle. Minor scaffold in “She had been retrocognitively blessed since childhood…”—slightly expository—but immediately grounded in present action. No loops or register drift; closure beat (“silence became light”) is artifact-free and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Fog became solid three hours ago” establishes time as active pressure. Figurative language is precise (“shadows stretched long, memories worn to single words”) without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in mid-story, but rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during descent, flowing in journal reflection. Final line (“silence that held more truth...”) earns its weight through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “gravity of hopelessness thick as tar” and “helix, a dancer of light” verge on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary well, though three consecutive lines begin with “She…” during ignition sequence (minor template cadence). No paraphrase loops, but “kerosene rag knot” repeats without evolution. Final paragraph’s “ember dust,” “mosaic dreams,” and “fireworks designer” risk stacked modifiers, yet propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs (“crunched,” “struck,” “spun”).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information yield per line (e.g., “ripples became tiny clocks”). Figurative language is consistent—water, shells, stars recur without muddle—and avoids purple excess. Minor redundancy in “texture of time” phrasing (lines 12 and 22) slightly dulls uniqueness, but not enough to obscure closure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; every image advances atmosphere, character, or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information density (“silence could be locked away,” “silvery threads that captured the breeze”). Minor overwriting in peak beats: “intangibly tangible” risks abstraction, and “stretched, contracted rhythm” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph’s cadence (“gilded hush deepened… doll glimmered”) resolves motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “vaulting hush,” “crystalline feathers,” “hummed with suppressed static” do triple duty—image, atmosphere, character. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or deepens texture. Minor deduction for slight overuse of metaphor in high-pressure beats (e.g., “tears tracking reflections... each droplet a lens”), but coherence holds. Final line’s cadence (“ready to teach silence its next lesson”) perfectly echoes opening whistle, closing the sonic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (peeling layers = uncovering truth) and pays off cohesively. Avoids loops and scaffold, though “kaleidoscopic waterfall” appears three times with minimal variation—a faint echo that slightly dulls uniqueness. Closure beat remains artifact-free; rhythm accelerates cleanly toward dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “loaded emptiness” recurs to reweight tone, “burned bridges carefully” evolves from destructive to constructive. Minor overwriting in mid-text (“each one a memory she nursed with tenderness”) slightly dilutes momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary (“She had cut,” “He arrived,” “With each breath”), and paragraphs shift length to mirror emotional cadence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “threshold” repetition edges toward motif fatigue without payoff loss.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and generally propulsive, with strong verbs (“traced,” “hiss,” “tumbled”) and varied syntax. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: “a superposition of intent across worlds” verges on jargon, and “quantum promise” explanations slightly stall momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines summarize the same idea (“threads tightened… abstract promise became physical”). Final paragraph’s lyricism earns its density, though one mixed metaphor (“stardust” vs. “gems”) slightly blurs imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“amber lamplight cast long, golden shadows across the cracked spines” establishes setting, mood, and history). However, repetitive phrasing (“golden shadows” appears 7 times) and near-synonym loops (“eloquently silent,” “silent gasp,” “eloquent silence”) create mild scaffold fatigue. The final third risks overwriting with stacked metaphors (“crumbling pages turning into a symphony of light”). Still, rhythm varies effectively, and closure image retains clarity despite ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful figurative language, but avoids overwriting: metaphors (“strings like silver threads of memory”) cohere within the established logic. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates at the climax (“He spoke the vow… cascade of silver-gold light”). Minor redundancy in “shivering bliss” (used thrice), but it serves as a tonal anchor rather than a loop. Final paragraph’s cadence masterfully echoes the opening’s stillness while reconfiguring it.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “dust patterns Marianne could read like a map” conveys method, character, and setting in one image. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor overwriting in “accumulated dust patterns Marianne could read like a map” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle impair clarity. Final line’s cadence (“tactfully hopeful, and that was enough”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful—nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (reflections, flickering stars, gold water) and pays off cohesively. Minor deduction: “revised histories and rotting fruit” slightly blends sensory registers, but not enough to obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence elevates without overwriting; zero paraphrase loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but over-dense: “quietly vivid” appears four times, “vested hush” five, creating synonym loops. Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats without functional payoff—“prism atrium in mist” repeats like a mantra. Final third suffers from paraphrase (“prophecy dissolved… left only a quietly vivid trace… faint echo of color and light”). These artifacts dull closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally overwrought (“mossy delight” repeated; “ashen skyborne arbor” borders on ornamental). Minor paraphrase loops: “transformed always” appears twice verbatim. Sentence openings vary, but high-pressure beats (e.g., cocoon unfolding) retain poetic calm, slightly dulling propulsion. No clarity loss, but near-purple patches flirt with opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme (“water-smooth sediment beneath the ashes” ties core concept to object). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (gears as heartbeat, greenhouse as cathedral). Minor figurative density in climax (“metal grinding against quartz in a protest of incompatible certainties”) risks overload but serves the Accumulative lens without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is rich but controlled; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor overwriting in “factually mystical in a way that defied her own ledgers”—slightly redundant—but quickly redeemed by concrete demonstration. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully. One near-miss: “luminous regret” appears twice, but second use deepens meaning (from personal to conceptual), justifying recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“children don’t travel lightly. Their joy sticks to places”). Figurative language is coherent and grounded—laughter as “broken mirrors and stitched-together apologies” extends the motif of fragmentation. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“sound like teeth on bone”) borders on excess but doesn’t obscure clarity. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the gorge’s echoes, and the final paragraph’s cadence delivers earned closure without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (UV as fire, memory as flood) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“map of tension she could read like skin”) edges toward abstraction, and two adjacent lines restate the strap’s significance (“held her focus” / “held the mask that muffled screams”). No scaffold loops or register drift, but information density dips slightly during the recitation of numbers, slowing momentum before the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency (e.g., “vials of memory and jars of forgotten tongues” conveys occupation, setting, and theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“elusively tangible” recurs with evolving resonance) and avoids muddle. Minor redundancy in “eternal instant” (used three times) edges toward loop, but payoff justifies recurrence. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “fluorescent tubes... buzzed for seventeen minutes” establishes time, sound, and decay in one beat. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dust... language,” “cracks... breathe secrets”) and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor scaffold in “He’d spent years analyzing dust... but this was choreography” slightly restates prior observation, but no loops or synonym churn dull key moments. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and technical terms (“mainspring barrel”) feel authentic without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“the frost wrote stories in fractal script”). Figurative language is coherent (smoke/memory, rustling/pages) and avoids muddle even in peak beats. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally (long descriptive sentences yield to short, sharp clauses at rupture). Final line (“waited for the next pattern to form”) echoes the opening while deepening stakes—perfect circular propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“gilded skull,” “burnished sorrow” recur with slight redundancy). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and paragraphs cut meaningfully. One paraphrase loop: “poet’s eye” / “poet’s heart” / “poet who knows words can outlast empires” risks motif fatigue. Closure image remains sharp despite minor figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “pendulum sliced seconds like a scythe” advances time and theme. Minimal loops; metaphors cohere (rust as flower, sound as glass). Slight overwriting in “symphony of tinkersong wonder” risks abstraction but pays off in closure’s “golden threads.” Final line crystallizes motif without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“glass vials heavy with petrichor” establishes motive and texture). Figurative language is coherent (petrichor as “permission,” lagoon as “hole in the world”) and peaks without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully (staccato descent vs. flowing revelation). Final paragraph’s “empty pocket” and “deepest silence” resolve with earned concision.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“hands perpetually learning the language of salt and grain”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “reverie of wind and blade and ancestors” slightly strains cadence, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s propulsion—“hands already remembering the next shape”—resolves with forward momentum, honoring the story’s accumulative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but mostly disciplined; sentences vary in length and structure, creating rhythm that mirrors the story’s cadence. High information density: “tendrils of night-blooming jasmine twining toward a silver star” conveys image, motion, and symbolism in one phrase. Minor overwriting in the final third (“shadows seemed to exhale a soft perfume”) edges toward purple prose. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines repeat “quiet” unnecessarily, slightly dulling momentum near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “searing reverie burning away sleep” conveys physical and psychological toll in one phrase. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with emotional rhythm. Minor overwriting in “solemn civil-rights archivist who had spent three decades…”—slightly expository—but quickly grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; every image (driftwood, shells, silver coast) feeds closure. Final line (“sand in her throat”) echoes earlier sensory motif with earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery and varied syntax, though occasional figurative stacking (“memories like tide-worn shells,” “tapestry of possibilities”) edges toward ornament in mid-text. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat is clean and resonant. Minor deduction for one near-redundant phrase (“resurrected spirit” / “ghost town revival”) and slight overuse of amber as descriptor, but momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “roots piercing the steel grating,” “wax shaving trembling as if alive,” “hum that rose and fell like a breathing lung.” Minor overwriting in “velvet disquiet wrapped in velvet” risks redundancy, and “quiet disquiet” borders on tautology. Otherwise, high information density, varied syntax, and rhythmic control support accumulation without loops or scaffold. Final line resonates without summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (frost as breath, starlight as liquid) and pays off in the vortex’s reversal. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“memories bloomed… hands planting seeds”) slightly slows momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s rhythmic variation enhances closure without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“fingers trailing along frost-kissed stone” conveys touch, setting, and ritual). Figurative language is coherent (sanctuary as “prayer frozen mid-breath”; rope as “heavy pendulum”) and never muddled. Minor redundancy in “windblown sanctuary” (used 4x), but it serves rhythmic accumulation, not loop. Final paragraph’s cadence—short sentences amid lyrical flow—perfectly modulates the earned calm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“uniform patched with fragments of meteoric iron, whispered of ages...”) and strong verbs (“swept stardust,” “cradled... like a sacred relic”). However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “flourishing stillness was not emptiness, but a fertile ground for unseen growth” edges into abstract declaration. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase risk in “quiet strength she had never known” following “heart swelled.” Final image avoids purple prose, landing with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally overwrought (“shimmered like a mirage,” “paper thin as a whisper” verge on cliché). Minor paraphrase loops: “tangled covenant” repeated without progression; “mute eloquence” appears four times with diminishing force. Final third avoids artifacts, but mid-story has slight synonym churn (“unspoken words,” “silenced voices,” “forgotten promises”). Still, rhythm supports accumulation, and closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “corroded jewel,” “numbers swam into new grammars,” “shadows were solid” do triple duty (image, theme, atmosphere). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Ten years ago…”, “Among the soggy…”, “She began…”). Minor figurative density in the climax (“sandpapered silk,” “prism refracting life”) risks slight overwriting but pays off in closure. Final line’s “borrowed heartbeat she no longer needed” crystallizes theme without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but suffers from paraphrase loops: “woven dawns” appears four times with minimal variation; “burnished hush” repeats three times nearly verbatim. Adjacent lines often restate concepts (“harmonize discord” / “turn dissonant sounds into melody”). Figurative density is high but coherent—feather as quill, lagoon as mirror—though some metaphors verge on conventional (“sky torn into shreds”). Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-story redundancy dulls propulsion and triggers a −0.8 Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (copper “sings,” pillars “dream”) and payoff-bound. Minor scaffold in “gently systematic” repetition (used 4x), but it’s motif-driven, not looped paraphrase. Final paragraph’s lyric compression (“orchard humming with brazen calm”) lands cleanly without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“amber that glinted like captured sunlight” conveys image, metaphor, and thematic echo). Rhythm modulates with scene needs; paragraph lengths vary visually and emotionally. Minor overwriting in “molecular blueprint that guided a wandering species back to its origin” edges toward abstraction, but the amber’s physical warmth grounds it. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s echo of “artificial pilgrimage” recharges the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“dust of battles,” “seed pods like tiny ships”) and paid off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ghost of the reef’s lifeblood”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the “submerged concord”—varied, resonant, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“The stench of metal and memory hung…”). Figurative language is purposeful and consistent—“rusted spine,” “Braille with his eardrums”—without muddle. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; even high-pressure beats avoid overwriting. The final line (“translate distance into closeness”) resonates because it’s earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“silence was not empty; it carried the ghost of footsteps”) and strong verbs (“ignited,” “tether,” “reconfigured”). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“temporally stretched… heartbeat echoing twice as long”) borders on redundant, but figurative coherence holds. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; closure beat (“sketching my own night sky”) is clean. One near-synonym pair (“confusion into exploration” / “turning confusion into exploration”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “footsteps echoing like whispers in a cathedral of glass” merges sound, space, and metaphor. Figurative language is coherent (bruised-plum sky, frozen starlight) without muddle. Minor redundancy in closing paragraphs (“ready for the next wrong sky… ready to amend”) slightly dulls momentum, but no scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Final line (“the wonder never does”) earns its lyricism through prior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “hands… bore scars of a massacre that had erased the pawns” merges character, setting, theme. Figurative language (“shadow stretching like a question mark”) serves motif without muddle. Minor scaffold: “quiet act of rebellion against the silence” slightly abstract but anchored by prior gesture. Sentence variety sustains momentum; final line’s echo lands with rhythmic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent (mountain’s “hidden thunder,” memory as “shard,” labyrinth as “map”) and avoids purple excess. Minor flaw: slight over-reliance on silver/mercury imagery (“silvery memory,” “pale silver light,” “silver script”) borders on repetitive, though it serves thematic unity. Sentence openings vary effectively; rhythm breathes with the narrative pulse. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift—elevated diction fits Mira’s seer identity perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (“woven hush draped over cobblestones,” “fierce repose”). Sentence variety supports momentum, and figurative language is coherent (threads = moves, labyrinth = guilt). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“rhythmic pulse that seemed to synchronize…”) slightly dulls propulsion, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids summary, resolving through resonant image (“first rays of dawn”).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“ribcage of a forgotten god,” “forged hush that felt more like a held scream”), though occasional figurative stacking in high-pressure beats slightly risks overwriting (e.g., “spectral display,” “chromatic defiance”). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for one near-redundant phrase (“refuse to owe” / “refusal to accept simplicity”), but clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears bit into rusted cogs” fuses sound, motion, and decay in one phrase. Figurative language is pattern-taught (quilting, kintsugi, scarab as vessel) and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor overwriting in “serpent of dire enchantment” slightly strains coherence, but no loops or scaffold dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence (“breath by held breath… something entirely new”) varies sentence length to echo resumption of gears, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information-per-line efficiency. Figurative language is mostly controlled (“mirror cracked… spiderweb of silver”), though “temporary eternity” repeats with diminishing returns and slightly muddles the peak beat. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent lines echo “fragile and infinite” / “fragile and infinite” conceptually. Final paragraph risks slight over-compression with motif stacking (“cracked mirror, painted seashell…”), dulling individual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “thunderclap that split the sky like a cracked bell” merges sound, image, and metaphor without muddle. Figurative language is pattern-taught (vibrations → resonance → ringing) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “petals exhaling their secrets” slightly dilutes peak beat, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line’s cadence—“we begin with silence”—resolves with rhythmic and thematic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“stitched his maps from memory and salvage, each line a scar”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“black tide lapping at the edges of a broken world”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent metaphors—“silent scream against the gears” followed by “scar on the landscape of loss”—edge toward stacked lyricism without functional payoff. Closure beat remains clear, but figurative density in high-pressure moments slightly blurs immediacy, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“roots gripping the rock,” “whisper crept through the stone”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match emotional beats. Minor overwriting appears in mid-story (“rumored cures in discredited textbooks” repeated nearly verbatim), triggering a slight paraphrase-loop deduction. Otherwise, high information density: each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“map of cracks that seemed to chart the broken world we were trying to mend”) avoids mixed metaphor and delivers resonant propulsion without scaffold or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “lantern swinging, its amber glow casting trembling shadows that seemed to whisper secrets” merges action, image, and subtext). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“slow heartbeat of the world”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and revelation. Final line (“forever illuminating the dark”) resonates without redundancy, though one or two adjectives (“ghostly,” “fragile”) edge toward convention.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “swollen song a timer counting down,” “cathedral of bioluminescent fungi,” “negative space that hurt to look at directly.” Figurative language is coherent—light motifs (glimmer, lighthouse, golden filigree, extinguished) evolve without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“its light finally extinguished”) lands with rhythmic and thematic precision, echoing Clara’s ash and Merrick’s loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line efficiency (“velvet cloak catching on thorns that grew upward, defying gravity”). Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“bleeding starlight,” “lacy menace”) and paid off cohesively. Minor overwriting in mid-climb description (“frost etching lacy menace across every surface, each crystal filigree a promise of slow suffocation”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm supports emotional arc flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls peak beats: “each heartbeat a star, each breath a galaxy” risks abstraction amid otherwise concrete action. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“return differently” repeated without deepening). Sentence variety sustains momentum, yet the final third leans on elevated diction (“beacon of presence,” “alchemists of being”) that slightly distances immediacy. Still, information density remains high, with lines multitasking atmosphere, character, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“scroll drank my ink like a thirsty ghost”), though occasional figurative stacking (“bark bleeding sap like ink”) risks slight overload in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short staccato phrases during tension (“I stepped through the door without opening it”) contrast lyrical flows elsewhere. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for two adjacent metaphors in the climax (“sap like ink” / “cold fire of lucid truth”) slightly muddling sensory channels.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“fog pressing against the windows,” “water chambers gleaming like captured rain”) and avoids scaffold or loops. Minor overwriting appears in two adjacent metaphors (“emotional terrain… bled into each other like watercolors in rain” / “world into a watercolor wash”), creating slight redundancy. Otherwise, syntax varies naturally, propulsion remains strong, and every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Final line resonates without flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring breath-holding and release. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., “latent ink,” “fractured as the ink crystallized under the weight of her grief”—where stacked modifiers slightly blur immediacy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines (“She could feel the weight… Each crystal a released memory”) verge on restatement without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the ink of truth seeping through the cracks of rumor” does thematic, atmospheric, and rhythmic work. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths mirror emotional beats (longer during reflection, fragmented at climax). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“ethereal grit of the moment”), but figurative language remains coherent. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“Paper became bone, ink became blood”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (spirals, hush, bleeding text) and payoff-integrated. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“millennia of false narratives pressed…”) slightly dulls momentum, but closure lines achieve crystalline precision. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (“razor edges” applied to light, key teeth, time itself) and never muddled. Minor repetition (“squinted… squinted again… squinted once more”) risks template cadence but serves thematic recurrence rather than scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops; momentum remains taut even in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “membranes parted like curtains of living silk” does setting, action, and metaphor in one. Minor overwriting in “quiet wildfire of their realization burned without smoke” slightly dilutes clarity, but figurative coherence holds. No loops or scaffold—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final line (“absence could bear fruit”) resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rainwashed library,” “city’s arteries held a secret map of chance”) and avoids redundancy. Sentence openings vary, and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: “tapestry woven from risk and reason” and “pulse of a gambler’s heart still beating in the walls” lean into figurative stacking without payoff, slightly blurring clarity. No loops or scaffold mar causality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“glass-walled kiosk,” “cascade of glass notes,” “iron walls glittered faintly”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match emotional beats. However, minor overwriting appears in peak moments: “melodically haunted, a glass harmonica disc spinning silently above her head” stacks modifiers, and “the city above moved on, unaware of the quiet magic in its depths” edges toward purple prose. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near the end (“She had learned that every ending is only the start of a new melody…”) risk conceptual redundancy. Clarity remains intact, though momentum softens slightly in the closing reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is controlled—“dark ribbon” jetty, “ghostly echoes” of words—but borders on overwriting in the middle third (“haunted euphoria” appears twice, slightly diluting impact). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though “proximate causes” repeats with diminishing specificity. Final paragraph’s rhythm beautifully mirrors thematic resolution, earning high marks despite minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “polite anarchy,” “wandering circus of strangers who traded rumors instead of tickets” do double duty. Figurative language is pattern-taught (ivy as blanket, then shroud, then shimmering veil) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “each whispered rumor a link in an improbable rumor chain” slightly redundancies “rumor,” but momentum holds. Final paragraph’s chime/hum motif pays off earlier cues without loop or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, though occasional figurative stacking (“quiet blaze of recognition consume her”) slightly overloads peak beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Minor register elevation in “uncharted emotional depths” risks slight therapy-speak but is grounded by immediate tactile context. Final line (“language of the stillpoint”) cleanly resolves opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (“whispered spirals,” “time pooled like honey”) and paid off in the pen’s mechanics. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“each stroke linking cause to effect…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Closure line (“the story never ends. It simply changes.”) resonates without redundancy. High information density with only one near-redundant beat (“strange comfort” repeated).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but never cluttered—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“camera cracked like dried mud,” “gravity that bent the air”) serves specificity, not ornament. Minor redundancy in “mapping silence” phrasing (lines 18, 22, 38), but no loops or scaffold dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“moon bore witness… water danced”) earns its lyricism through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “steam hissed... carrying the scent of sulfur and something older—paper, leather, the ghost of a million voices” advances atmosphere, character, and theme. Minor overwriting in “volcanic tenderness erupted... fury hot enough to melt stone”—slightly strained metaphor—but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“They had been...”, “In the seventh chamber...”, “Using charcoal...”).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: “regrets blossomed into dying chords” merges setting, emotion, and concept. Sentence openings vary (“He perched…”, “Below him…”, “Tonight he…”); paragraph lengths shift with tension. Figurative language is coherent (garden as memory medium, lagoon as consciousness forge). Minor overwriting in “auroral sorrow” phrase, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closure beat (“two heartbeats…”) is crystalline, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “oil over glass,” “corrugated wall,” “tarnished key with no apparent lock” do triple duty—character, setting, theme. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or deepens atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (sound as architecture, storm as amplifier) and never muddled. Final line (“silence builds better bridges than thunder ever could”) recharges the opening without redundancy, closing the cadence with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Sentence rhythm breathes with the scene—slower during stillness, quicker during interaction. Minor overwriting: “spiralingly calm” appears twice as label; “stillwater tension” borders on coined abstraction. No loops or scaffold, but “dental mirror” repetition leans decorative in final paragraphs. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“each piece a stand-in for a citizen”; “magnetic grotto hummed with subtle energy”), though occasional overwriting appears (“forests of second thoughts” repeated thrice). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm supports accumulation. Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing (“amplified quiet”) slightly jars, but closure remains clear. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum—no dead weight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences vary rhythmically, with strong verbs (“untangled,” “dissolved,” “sway”) and concrete nouns (“whalebone,” “skiff,” “brine”). One minor flaw: “floating mound of sand and shadow that defied maps” edges toward abstraction, but immediately grounded by “stepped ashore.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure beat (“world... sang with her”) resonates without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative language is purposeful (“blades as scissors cutting the sky”) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“a silent sentinel in a world of forced smiles”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids summary, closing on resonant image. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“spine of frozen music,” “cloud-shadow of words”) cohere within established physics of this world. Minor overwriting appears in mid-text (“dissolve the edges of meaning” echoes earlier phrasing), triggering a −0.3 density penalty. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and every line advances atmosphere or theme. Closure beat avoids artifacts—final image sharp, resonant, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“frozen breath of memory,” “molten glass droplet… swirling with colors she could not see but could feel”). Figurative language is coherent and sustained, not overwhelming. Minor redundancy in “imperfection” mentions, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the story’s cadence—quiet, resonant, earned. Read-aloud test passes: varied sentence openings and lengths create natural propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose avoids loops; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict. Figurative density peaks purposefully (“golden shadows pooled like molasses”) without muddle. Minor scaffold in “artificial pilgrimage” explanation slightly slows momentum, but payoff justifies it. Final paragraph’s rhythmic variation (“textured and golden and impossibly alive”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Figurative language is coherent (“dying stars hung like frozen breath,” “curtains of intention”) and never muddled. Minor density in the middle (“synthetic moonstone and lab-grown sorrow… chemically perfect, and hollow”) edges toward overwriting but serves thematic setup. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates then resolves cleanly, with zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Closure beat is artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose density is high: “steel tape unspooling like a tongue telling truths” merges tool, body, and theme. Minor overwriting in “sacred geometry of greed that had built and destroyed worlds” slightly strains metaphor coherence. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence (“one card at a time… pixel in the pattern”) pays off opening rain motif with rhythmic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly economical, though occasional overwriting appears (“cascade of images flooded her mind” followed by enumerated memories). Minor paraphrase-loop: “fragile epoch when the empire fell and hope turned to dust” echoes later “end of innocence is not a single moment but a continuum.” Sentence openings vary well; rhythm supports pressure. No scaffold or template cadence, but one redundant beat in memory description slightly dulls climax propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“petals of glass,” “shadow unbound”) and pays off at closure. Minor overwriting in “luminous veil that draped over the library”—slightly ornamental—but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“starlight like liquid silver,” “truth remembered” in blue skin) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“fragile and vivid… whatever came next”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure remains sharp. No loops, scaffolds, or register slips—information density is high without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steam coil around her fingers,” “stones themselves were breathing,” and “sand flowed like liquid silver” do triple duty advancing atmosphere, character, and theme. Minor overwriting appears in the final third (“gentle hum of possibility,” “quiet promise of renewal”) where figurative language slightly stacks without pattern payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near closure repeat “quiet” unnecessarily. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively, though one run of participle openings (“feeling… watching… knowing…”) risks syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line: “carbon arc housing,” “amber sludge,” “Maltese cross movement” all serve character, theme, and setting. Figurative language is coherent—love as static charge, letters as frames—and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“geometries of emotion, mapping themselves across synapses”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure lines (“map of stored love glowing faintly through clothes”) recover with crystalline clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every sentence earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting (“unwritten seas,” “luminous scar on the darkness”). Minor paraphrase loops exist: “silence” and “quiet” recur redundantly in adjacent lines. However, sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. No scaffold or template cadence; final paragraph avoids artifact intrusion, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“The sparks... were dying” conveys urgency and loss in six words). Figurative language is coherent—bioluminescence strobes panic, null-zones eat possibility—without muddle. Final paragraph’s fractured lullaby echoes earlier motifs while deepening resonance. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“unbearable light” could be more embodied), but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“steam-mangroves became today’s crystal-fern valleys”). Figurative language is coherent—mechanical/biological metaphors never contradict (e.g., “neural pathways” of forest). Minor overwriting in mid-section (“oak-turbines sang of consequence…”) slightly bloats, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“hum that never ceased”) earns its lyricism through accumulated resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density (“silver cord fraying into the wind,” “vigil of fireflies”). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “shoreline lullaby” repeats 5 times, verging on scaffold. Final paragraph’s “step by indirect step” echoes earlier phrasing without new pressure—a mild paraphrase loop. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting dulls propulsion in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“snow pressing against the windows like a mourner’s hands”). Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts heighten tension (e.g., the single-line “She stopped.”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold—every image serves pressure or closure. Figurative language is precise (“frostbitten hope”) and never muddled; the bolt’s “cold, heavy, and utterly without beauty” conveys thematic weight economically.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    High information density: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is cohesive (starlight, ink, drift motifs) without muddle. Minor overwriting in early paragraphs (“crumbling pillars wrapped in vines of silvered starlight” borders on ornate), but no loops or scaffold. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through image (“motes of light,” “graceful collapse”). One near-paraphrase (“quiet thunder” / “regally unpretentious”) slightly dilutes impact, but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line efficiency: “each bleaching a silent scream” compresses ecological trauma into visceral metaphor. Sentence openings vary (“She had watched…”, “Now she worked…”, “One morning…”) and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching tidal ebb and flow. Minor overwriting occurs in “periodically eternal” (used thrice), verging on redundant emphasis, but never obscures causality. Final lines achieve resonant propulsion: “a quiet echo of hope” lands without sentimentality due to preceding concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “thunderous serenity that was both violent peace and silent storm”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“syncopated rhythm that made her teeth ache and her bare feet tingle”) slightly dilutes clarity, but no loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts serve rhythm, and figurative language coheres (hum as song, silence as disease). Final line’s “feet still humming” pays off earlier tactile motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “her knees protesting each step” conveys age, terrain, and resolve in five words. Figurative language is consistent—volcanic motifs (ash, steam, eruption) recur without contradiction. Minor artifact: slight overuse of botanical metaphors in mid-story (“ferns rustled their approval”), but none obscure causality or dull closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“roots already rewriting the story”) earns its lyricism through prior grounding in plant-telepathy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks (e.g., “bark scarred by decades of wind” conveys setting, time, and Elias’s own scarring). Figurative language is pattern-taught: “pearl of stillness,” “nacre from grit,” “kite without string” all accrue meaning. Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm varies naturally. One minor slip: “somatic marker activated” borders on clinical but is immediately grounded in “fingers remembered her hand.” Closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without scaffold or loop. Figurative language is pattern-taught (luminescent ache, velvet fingers of darkness) and coheres physically—threads vibrate, walls breathe, mortar weeps salt. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“lives that might have been”) slightly dilutes peak pressure, but closure lines (“each step a question she no longer needed answered”) achieve perfect cadence and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence multitasking (e.g., “stone walls etched by centuries of gusts” establishes setting, history, and motif). Figurative language is coherent—ink “shimmered,” patterns “glowed faintly”—without muddle. Minor redundancy in describing ink’s properties twice, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“calm and furious, ready for the next slow motion crisis”) earns its lyricism through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is muscular and evocative without overwriting—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. High information density: “wax that cracked like a knuckle” conveys sound, texture, fragility. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in mid-story (“frozen lullabies,” “virus of authenticity”), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines (“snow above continued to fall, burying the old silence beneath the new”) perfectly reprise and reweight opening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or motif. Sentence rhythm varies effectively; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Minor overwriting in “tranquil blaze” and “quiet fire” risks slight redundancy, but not enough to blur clarity. No loops or scaffold—each image earns its place. Final lines resonate without flourish, fulfilling the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (transliteration motif) and coheres—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“honey and grief, wild and sweet, feral and tender”) slightly blurs sensory focus, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Zero loops or scaffold; closure image (“spike... dreaming of metal and sky”) crystallizes without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (orbits, gravity wells, black holes) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “fog billowed like old headlines dissolving into mist”—slightly strained—but quickly grounded by marble walls and ticking clocks. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism. Closure beat remains sharp, not dulled by ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “constellations unraveling, star by star, a celestial fabric tearing softly” merges image and theme. Figurative language is coherent (no mixed metaphors), and sentence variety supports cadence shifts. Minor density in high-pressure beats (“ghostly projections faded... empty space where stars had been”) edges toward overwriting but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but controlled—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (whispers, hush, vibration) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “emergent hush deepened until she could hear her own heartbeat echoing in the stone” slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors dissipating mist and resolved tension.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “shattered sky that looked like cracked glass,” “mosaic’s fractured beauty a map of survival,” “beacon of warm coldness” verge on mixed metaphor and stacked modifiers. Paraphrase loops occur (“Plaza of Embers… name carved in stone and heart… Plaza of Embers glowed”). Final third contains scaffolded repetition (“cradled empathy in arms of steel” x3), dulling closure impact and triggering artifact penalties that cap high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“petals that chimed like glass bells” conveys sound, texture, magic), but occasional overwriting dilutes propulsion: “synesthetic symphony, colors swirling around the actress like a gentle storm” risks mixed metaphor. No paraphrase loops, but three adjacent sentences begin with “He…” during the coin ritual, creating minor cadence drag. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality, though “rising nostalgia that healed” edges toward abstraction. Overall clarity remains high, but peak beats carry slight figurative bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “frozen auroras,” “somatic marker,” “fractally precise chaos” each pull double duty in atmosphere and concept. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“each thread a potential signal, each node a possible failure point”) edges toward redundancy, but propulsion remains strong. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; figurative logic stays coherent (geode as mirror, network, resonator). Final paragraph’s “light paint the future” risks abstraction but is grounded by the geode’s warmth against her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“walls wet with salt and memory,” “tapestry of colour on her visor”), though occasional overwriting appears (“grief was a transitional object” borders on label-speak). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for one mixed register moment (“transitional object” leans academic), but closure image remains vivid and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “petrified sap that glowed with trapped fireflies from epochs past” conveys setting, time scale, and magical realism in one clause. Figurative language remains coherent (sand as both prison and garden medium; buttons as syllables), avoiding mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary purposefully (“She moved…”, “In the deepest vault…”, “On the seventh day…”), and paragraph cuts align with cognitive shifts. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in button taxonomy description, which risks abstraction despite concrete anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“mist like a shroud,” “codes like sleeping things”) without overloading peak beats. Minor scaffold in “prudently daring” repetition (three mentions) slightly edges toward label-use, but each instance ties to a distinct action. Final paragraph’s momentum falters just slightly with “empty hands but a full heart”—a rare dip into abstraction—but recovers with “thawing world.”

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“rain gutters that ticked above the tollhouse” establishes time, place, and motif). Figurative language is coherent—fog “holds its breath,” river stones “click”—with no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“Silas the coachman…”, “His hands…”, “The yarn needle…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., post-reunion silence). Minor overwriting in “universe of patience collapsing” slightly muddles peak beat, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“wild rosemary flourished between cracked flagstones, defying the logic of drought and dust”). Figurative language is consistent—clay, glaze, wheel metaphors unify texture without muddle. Minor scaffold in “fractured timelines coexisted here, layered like glazes” slightly echoes earlier phrasing, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the Accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“The tool's tooth had once traced the depths of keys, but now it scored soil, each notch a promise”) and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“cathedral of fragrance,” “luminous harbor blessing”) slightly dilutes propulsion—figurative density appears in 4/6 high-pressure sentences without full pattern payoff. No loops or scaffolds; every image serves theme or character. Closure line (“hand that turns them both”) resolves with resonant specificity, though one mixed metaphor (“silvered sea” after literal harbor) triggers −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with image but avoids overwriting; each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Strong verbs (“flickering,” “hum,” “shatter”) and specific nouns (“crystalline scrolls,” “bronze”) anchor abstraction. Minor redundancy in “brittle awakening” appearing twice slightly dulls propulsion. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final paragraph’s cadence powerfully echoes earlier motifs without paraphrase.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density (“rain kissed petals,” “thrush’s secret songs”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (water/light motifs recur cohesively) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“delicate prose,” “fragile sculpture”) slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beats (“sealed with a drop of rain”) are taut. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Deducted for two adjacent descriptive clauses (“mirrors, threads of silk, and fragments of the nest”) that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “cosmic tricksters embedding infra-linguistic commands” conveys concept, threat, and method in one phrase. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer sentences for setup, staccato during action (“She flipped the switch...”). Minor overwriting in “ethereal grit of the situation crystallized,” but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent (starlight in fog, frost under sunlight); no mixed metaphors. Closure beat is clean: “static, stubborn faith, and the knowledge that someone was listening” resonates without purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with layered imagery, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “phantom threshold that only the precise geometry... could transfix” strains clarity. Minor paraphrase loops (“wistful rebellion” repeated; “compass point” overused). Sentence variety supports rhythm, yet some high-pressure beats suffer stacked modifiers (“lonely organ’s call,” “malevolent will”). Final lines are strong, but mid-story figurative density occasionally blurs cause/effect without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist coiled between limestone walls like breath on a mirror” establishes tone without overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful—“lanced it with details” ties to the “lance” motif—and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor redundancy in “methodical blindness” / “methodical process” slightly dulls momentum, but no loops or scaffold mar peak beats. Final line’s parallelism (“see them both”) earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “spongey dread like wet wool in her lungs” does triple duty—sensation, metaphor, emotional state. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts align with pressure shifts. One paraphrase loop (“questioned the official maps… found them hollow as a coffin’s emptiness” echoes earlier coffin imagery) slightly dulls closure, but figurative coherence remains intact. No scaffold or template cadence; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, with high information-per-line (e.g., “plastic sheeting rippled like a secret map”). Minor overwriting in “pixelated amnesty etched in each small shard”—metaphor slightly strained. No loops or scaffolding; sentence variety supports momentum. Deduction for occasional stacked modifiers (“mournful coda for a stranger,” “luminous disbelief that sometimes settles”) that border on purple without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density: “faded banner,” “trapeze artist losing grip,” “velvet curtain” each advance atmosphere and character. Minimal loops; varied syntax avoids monotony. One slight overwriting cluster (“ghostly refrain,” “dusky harmony,” “polished calm”) in mid-text risks density but pays off tonally. Final paragraph’s propulsion sharpens toward earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stars as tears, temple as silence) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph (“finger accusing the darkness”) borders on purple but serves voice. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally, though one adjacent paraphrase (“burden alone… weights are meant to be carried together”) slightly dulls momentum. Final line earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “roots sinking into the ice, a crimson vine winding upward with a ravenous hunger”). Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph (“carried the truth like a lantern”) slightly dilutes the otherwise concrete closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentence openings vary, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Nearly flawless, but not quite 9.0 due to that one abstract beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (scars as maps, roots as memory) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “starlight and regret” risks abstraction but is grounded by context. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “tree roots snaked between bones, inlaying meaning everywhere” merges setting, theme, and action. Figurative language is coherent (tarot/card/root as interconnected symbols) and peaks without muddle. Minor redundancy in “inlaying meaning everywhere” (used thrice) slightly dulls uniqueness, but propulsion remains strong. Final paragraph’s “fiercely gentle as dawn” ties voice to theme without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density (“wind carried the faint echo of blasted rock,” “facts were safe, unlike the applause”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase-loop risk: “echo” recurs 7 times, but pattern is taught early and pays off in closure. No scaffold or register drift; figurative language remains coherent (cloth as “tangible note of her own encore”). Final lines avoid purple prose while delivering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“star-iron sang as it scored the magnetic lines”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“physics of transition was not a boundary but a braid”) slightly dilutes clarity, but figurative logic remains coherent. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line (“translation is never finished, only transformed”) perfectly echoes the opening’s “absence.”

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gears storing moments that tomorrow could no longer hold” compresses time, identity, and loss in one phrase. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere or conflict. Figurative language is coherent (tidal memory, wintersun serenity) and payoff-driven. Minor deduction for slight overuse of semicolons in middle section, but closure beat remains crystalline—“Let them be fish” lands with earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “resonant hush,” “starving beast” ribs, “spectral promises” all serve multiple functions. Minor overwriting in “latent radiance pulsing in rhythm with her own heartbeat”—slightly redundant—but doesn’t obscure closure. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“As a doomsday…”, “In a footlocker…”, “She read them…”). Final paragraph’s cadence perfectly mirrors thematic release without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line efficiency. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, figurative density borders on overload in mid-story: “map references... like wounds,” “ivory fingers trailing,” “silent song,” “tapestry of whispered confessions” create a slight metaphor pile-up. No loops or scaffold, but the phrase “raw solace” repeats verbatim, functioning as a minor paraphrase artifact that nudges down an otherwise strong line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “hinges sighing like old memories”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “cautious exuberance” appears twice verbatim, dulling its charge slightly. Figurative language is coherent (mist = secrets, watch = stolen time), though “propagation delays” risks abstraction—saved by immediate embodiment in ticking and gears. Final beat remains clear despite lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “mulberry ache of a decision that was both loss and liberation”). Figurative language is coherent—velvet, ice, perforations recur without muddle. Minor overwriting in midsection (“dewdrop on a spider’s web”) slightly slows momentum, but closure beats remain sharp. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary effectively to sustain lyric rhythm without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“static as light,” “green fire”) and paid off in the droplet capture. Minor overwriting in “cosmic static waiting to be read” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Closure image (“winter jasmine bloomed forever”) is crystalline, uncluttered by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “grapes that held the luminous memories of souls between lives” does worldbuilding, character, and atmosphere in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent—clouds “pooled like spilled milk,” vines “coiling like dark serpents”—and escalates meaning without muddle. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “fifteen thousand sunsets” (precise number risks distraction), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s jam-on-bread image earns its simplicity after rich metaphor, avoiding purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cloak of doubt, a fabric that whispered questions” does triple duty (character, theme, atmosphere). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. One paraphrase loop: “emptiness mirrored my own conflict” followed by “my own conscience was for hire” slightly restates. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “pale eye blinking” verges on mixed metaphor (lighthouse as eye, then chimes as voice). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Each ring held a fragment of truth, woven carefully into the water's memory”), but occasional overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“magnetic grotto whispered a final secret... gentle caress rather than a demand”). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“vanish not into nothing, but into the embrace of the infinite” echoes earlier lines). Still, rhythm varies naturally, and closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “pure harmonic tone that merged with the birds' urgent calls into a symphony of meaning” edges toward abstraction. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm. However, “layered dust” repeats four times—functional as motif but flirting with scaffold. No loops or causality-obscuring artifacts; closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative bloat in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “dissolving his coherence into the morning fog and letting it carry him upward on breaths of evaporating memory” does worldbuilding, character, and plot in one line. Minimal loops; varied syntax supports emotional cadence. One slight overwriting risk (“cathedral of dying light”) but it pays off in closure. Final paragraph avoids scaffold—every phrase earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shelves bowed like the ribs of a whale” conveys setting, mood, and metaphor), and rhythm varies skillfully. However, figurative density occasionally borders on overwriting: three consecutive high-pressure beats use glitter/ember/light metaphors (“luminous vow spilled forth… glittered like embers… painted the air”), risking coherence. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “luminous vows” repeats four times with diminishing specificity. Final image remains clear, so artifacts don’t obscure closure, but they prevent 9+ line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept without scaffold or loop. Information multi-tasks: “coins clinked as she arranged them in the sacred pattern” conveys sound, ritual, and tension. Figurative coherence is maintained (“doubt pooled… like dark matter” → “stellar doubt” → “wavelength stretch outward”), with no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“She was…”, “In her palm…”, “Tonight was…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Final line lands with syntactic inevitability, echoing prophecy structure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“The wax cylinder spun, and a voice gasped…”). Figurative language is coherent—light scatters, refracts, focuses—without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the break before “She realized then…”). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the middle (“kraken’s tentacle became ‘the fear of being forgotten’”), but no artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled (e.g., “faith over doubt” as “thin crust”), avoiding purple excess. Minor scaffold in repetitive “drip” references, but pattern serves accumulative design. One paraphrase loop: “cosmic imbalance” mentioned twice within close proximity without added pressure. Otherwise, high information density and rhythmic propulsion support the textural escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language (“perfume of resurrection,” “stories like water”) is restrained and resonant. Minor overwriting in phrases like “teeming beneath” slightly dilutes immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift mars key beats. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors opening, creating closure without redundancy. High information density sustains momentum without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, each line multitasking: “silver apples hummed with captive moonlight” establishes setting, tone, and motif. Figurative language is coherent—glacier remembering cloud, sugar in tea—and never muddles cause/effect. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor density risk: near-continuous metaphor in high-pressure beats, but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented in peak beats: “soundless echo” appears four times with diminishing returns, creating paraphrase-loop fatigue. Figurative density spikes (“breath a faint mist,” “vines of the great floating tree,” “restless fireflies”) without pattern-teaching payoff, muddying focus during crisis. Sentence openings vary well, but template cadence emerges in reflective passages (“He remembered… He imagined… He knew…”). Closure beat suffers slight dulling from redundant motif restatement rather than sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (“History shuddered again, and the clones flickered…”). Figurative language is controlled—“silver-blue veins” of light, “motives folding into his restored whole”—without muddle. Minor scaffold in “complementary opposites” explanation slightly slows momentum, but it’s necessary setup. No loops or synonym churn; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence (“No more katas without heart…”) lands with earned resonance, not repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwrought: “storm born silence” appears three times with diminishing returns, and “orthogonal” is used four times without sufficient variation. Minor paraphrase loops (“safeguarding a space for innovation” / “safeguard this space for innovation”). Final third avoids major artifacts, but figurative density in mid-story (“silver ribbons,” “tributary feeding the river”) risks purple prose. Sentence openings vary well; rhythm supports mood.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Figurative language (“choir of broken kazoos,” “damp plaster” of grief) is consistent and coherent within the established logic. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“macerated the hard silence that had calcified around Sarah's heart”)—slightly abstract—but does not obscure causality. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is coherent (mist→pages, ice→ink) and pattern-taught early. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; rhythm varies naturally. Final lines (“began to dream its way home”) resonate without overwriting. Minor deduction only because a few high-pressure beats lean slightly on metaphor density, though never at cost of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “twilight bled into the ruins,” “ash became a tree of frozen glass.” Figurative language is pattern-taught (embers → frozen stars → fire-flowers) and payoff is exact. Minor overwriting in “creative destruction was not about destroying to build…” slightly abstracts mid-beat, but recovers instantly with concrete action. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“hush,” “seed,” “geometry”) and pays off without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; varied syntax avoids drumbeat rhythm. Minor deduction: “practical relief” slightly risks label-speak but is immediately grounded in “pressure release valve for the soul.” Final line (“waiting for someone to discard enough assumptions”) perfectly echoes opening moss-grooves, closing the sonic circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “clocks run sideways” conveys time distortion and setting in four words). Figurative language is consistent—starlight as silver threads, radio static as lullaby—and avoids muddle. Minor scaffold appears in closing repetitions (“permanent transient,” “resiliently positive”) but serves thematic resonance, not loop. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts align with emotional beats. No filter-verb stacks or simultaneity errors; clarity holds even in high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “water flowed upward, defying gravity, following the paths Mira had woven” merges physics, emotion, and causality in one clause. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is coherent—sinew as dream-harvested fiber, water as dissolved connection—and never muddles peak beats. Final line (“The gallery breathed on”) echoes opening calm while deepening its meaning, closing the cadence loop without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft excels in information density: “bioluminescent tattoos pulsing uncertainly” conveys setting, character state, and thematic tension in six words. Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during Corin’s question, flowing during meditation sequences. Minor artifact: “balancedly curious” appears three times with slight redundancy, though each instance ties to a tactical choice. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final line (“navigate by starlight”) recharges the anchor motif without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “plastic yellowed, its circuits humming faintly”). Figurative language is purposeful (“voices thin as fog”) and coherent. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“reeling hush” repeated) slightly dulls momentum, but closure beat remains sharp. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally to match emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “gold fleck illuminants… catching… like trapped stars” conveys object, function, and mood). Minor overwriting in two adjacent lines (“invisible things Marek tracked weren’t ghosts… but electromagnetic signatures”) edges toward paraphrase-loop, slightly dulling the ghostprint revelation. Otherwise, rhythm varies skillfully, and every image serves escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “frozen thought,” “ephemeral patterns... spread like nerves,” “heartbeats... a note of restored rhythm” avoid cliché. Sentences vary in length and structure, with strong verbs (“rose,” “shattered,” “resonating”). Minor overwriting in “thousand echoing bits that needed to be defragmented”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Figurative coherence is maintained (ceramic/digital fracture metaphor), and the closure image (“wisdom settle like ink drying”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“her metallic veins catching the last light of a sun that remembered no names”). Figurative language is coherent—copper, bone, stone motifs interlock without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“microscopic ridges, its internal stress, its curse”) slightly slows momentum, but peak beats remain clear. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Enough to fill a canyon...”) varies rhythm purposefully, avoiding template repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“gravity like a toy,” “static-laden truth that burned away bitterness”), but pattern-taught and consistent. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. A slight paraphrase loop appears in the metamorphosis sequence (“Her own form began to shift… skin glowing… eyes reflecting starlight” echoes earlier celestial imagery). Closure remains legible, but the density in peak beats risks muddling causality—e.g., how exactly the arrowhead “unlocks a door”—though this ambiguity serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “fruit turn to clockwork gears that fell with rusted clatter instead of ripe thuds” conveys setting, stakes, and loss). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“gap between knowing and understanding” recurs meaningfully) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“resonantly soft” appears thrice)—not enough to obscure clarity but slightly dilutes uniqueness. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., “She played the locust’s rhythm.” as standalone).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “a thunderstorm in a bottle, sealed by a promise that had shattered long ago” compresses backstory, object, and motive. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = mask = message) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “neon veins pulsing like a heartbeat” risks slight purple, but rhythm supports momentum. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final line’s “fragile link” echoes “ghost of a connection” without redundancy—earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“fog itself held its breath” conveys setting and stakes). Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“shimmering quiet, each crack… filled with soft, glowing light”), where stacked modifiers slightly blur causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences repeat “mist” concepts (“misting hush… dissolved into shimmering quiet” / “misting hush returned, softer now”). Rhythm varies effectively, though final paragraph’s cadence verges on incantatory redundancy without propulsion loss.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence performs multiple duties (character + setting + theme). Figurative language is pattern-taught (scarf as map, books as black holes) and paid off without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; rhythm varies organically (“Her motivation, refined over twenty years…” vs. “The scarf untied itself…”). Minor deduction only because a few high-pressure beats verge on over-compression (“raw weight of déjà vu” risks abstraction), but never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose—nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“silver hooves silent on light-brushed waves”). Figurative language is consistent (light-based metaphors never contradict) and peaks coherently. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“amber bleeding into rose”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines avoid summary, resolving through recharged motif (“luminous absence”). Information density remains high without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“denim and a quiet that heard too much” establishes attire, demeanor, and sensory acuity). Rhythm varies naturally, with paragraph lengths mirroring cosmic hush and ritual intensity. Minor overwriting appears in “enveloped secrets that pressed against the seams of ordinary speech”—slightly strained metaphor—but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every image (ribbon, hair, star) recurs with reweighted meaning. Final line ties back to opening twilight, creating resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere (“The chronically curious do not fear tetanus or ghosts; they fear unanswered questions”). Figurative language is coherent—shipwrecks as “corroded constellations,” memories as “broken constellations that cut.” Zero paraphrase loops; rhythm modulates with stakes (measured cadence during study, urgency in cultivation). Closure line (“some fairy rings should never be disturbed”) crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “nervous, she walks backwards, a habit that turns corridors into labyrinths of hesitation” conveys trait, consequence, and metaphor in one beat. Figurative language is pattern-taught (shards, spirals, swings) and pays off cohesively. Minor overwriting in “combative tenderness that has become her signature” slightly flattens immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence shift deepens hush without sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “sap of between-ness” conveys setting, cost, and theme in three words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (colors as essences) and pays off cohesively—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “violet of a child’s first laugh, amber of a dragon’s final flight” risks density overload, but clarity holds. Final paragraph’s cadence (“doors opening and closing... living, growing thing”) resolves momentum without loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “spectral geometry,” “lucid unrest,” “residual hush” do triple duty—character, atmosphere, theme. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is coherent (light/silence/refraction motif) and never muddles clarity. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in mid-section (“second knot held… third a wedding band”), but closure image (“pearl pulsed warm”) remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“hands moved methodically, each brushstroke a quiet question”). Figurative language is purposeful (“whispers recorded in silence of stone”) without muddle. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops. Final line (“marking the place where her journey had reopened the world”) resonates without redundancy. One slight density spike in middle paragraph, but no momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“anemones and sorrow,” “saltwater calculus”). Figurative language is coherent—snow as memory, water as regret—and never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional rhythm (e.g., ending on “Death, being Mort, simply waited”). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “physics was emotional after all,” which edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by immediate concrete follow-up.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “graffiti roses, each petal a cipher” does setting, symbol, and plot work. Minor overwriting in peak beats—e.g., “ghost in code surged forth, no longer a whisper but a choir”—edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Final third avoids artifacts, though “luminous echo above the clouds” slightly softens closure’s edge with vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, plot, or atmosphere. Figurative language (“sun scattered in every crystal”) serves mechanics, not ornament. Zero loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally (e.g., participle openings for motion, fragments for revelation). Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes theme without redundancy. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“fractured into prismatic arrays”), but clarity never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“metallic whisper,” “insect wings”) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“spooled wholeness of every disturbance…”) slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure causality. Final paragraph’s rhythmic repetition (“Empty spaces remember…”) earns its lyricism through prior groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful metaphor (“shelves spiraling upward like the rings of time”), but occasionally overloads high-pressure beats (e.g., “fractally precise” appears three times in close proximity, verging on label-repetition). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. One paraphrase loop: “the sky inside them flickering, as if the building itself was unsure whether to hold on or let go” slightly restates the prior tension without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere (starlings as “flickering clock,” airship “humming in approval”). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“sociable isolation defined her days…”) slightly stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold, but “stranded luminance” appears four times with diminishing specificity, verging on refrain fatigue. Final paragraph recovers with concrete action (“traced the carvings”), restoring propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“driftwood nostalgia,” “clockmaker’s gear assortment”) and coheres without muddle. Minor redundancy in “hauntingly bright” (used 3×), but it serves thematic resonance, not loop. Final paragraph avoids scaffold—each sentence tightens the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony; rhythm breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphors (“nebula of respite,” “tapestry of shared purpose”) cohere within the established lyric logic. Minor overwriting appears in the climax (“droplets spiraled upward, forming a shimmering mist”) where physics bend without prior cue, risking clarity. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences summarize the orchard’s renewal redundantly. Final line lands with rhythmic precision and motif payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “nested patterns of possibility, each spiral folding into smaller spirals like seashells made of frozen time” does setting, theme, and character work. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“bruised awe of something ending perfectly”) slightly blurs propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s diction (“written mercy into the geometry of endings”) earns its lyricism through prior patterning. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, stakes, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled (“bronze wings caught the last light,” “torchlight bobbing like a question mark”) and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching urgency. Final line (“graceless in her duty, beautiful in its execution”) crystallizes tone without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless, with cadence tightening as frost approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary (“Dr. Elena Voss…”, “She had come…”, “The river below…”), and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: “grief had woven itself into Elena's research like a stubborn polymer chain” followed immediately by “translate that separation into connection” risks metaphor stacking. No loops or scaffold, but the lab paragraph’s summary (“she synthesized…”) slightly dulls the ravine’s dramatized momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “glimmering parole: the conditional release from one's own narrative” compresses concept, character, and world logic in one phrase. Figurative language is consistent (moonlight as sand, stars as puncture wounds) and never muddled. Sentence openings vary (“She measured…”, “A woman entered…”, “‘I need…’”), and paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Closure beat (“her clean slate radiantly empty”) lands with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line yield: “sorrow spread through the kitchen like yeast” conveys contagion, profession, and metaphor in seven words. Figurative language is coherent (memory as fossil, remorse as gravity, grief as taste) and pattern-taught early. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the pavilion descent (“silver mirrors reflecting a sky that wasn’t there” borders on abstraction), but closure remains lucid and propelled.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“bridges spanned the silos, built of melody and starlight”). Sentence openings vary (“Under the hush…”, “She had discovered…”, “The elevators were not…”), and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“vigorous and tender,” “empathetically decisive”)—slightly elevated diction that doesn’t obscure clarity but edges toward label-speak. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm serves the accumulative design flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—“shadows gathered in moonlit crevices like abandoned thoughts”—and avoids paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“chaotically precise” repeated three times), slightly muddying focus. No scaffold or simultaneity errors; every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Final image (“moonlight continued its quaking reverie… spiraling like DNA”) delivers resonant propulsion without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Syntax varies effectively, with paragraph lengths mirroring drift vs. urgency. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“blazed into sharp relief,” “latent blaze of purpose ignite within her chest”)—figurative density slightly high but pattern-taught and paid off in the closing “quiet fire.” No loops, scaffold, or simultaneity errors; clarity remains intact even during inversion sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “symphonically minded” and “empathy in motion” verge on label-speak, though redeemed by context. Minor redundancy in describing silence (“intensely quiet,” “cushion of silence,” “silent world”). However, rhythm modulates effectively—from hushed stillness to “cascade” of sound—and the final note lingers with resonant concision. No scaffold loops or syntactic monotony mar key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose exhibits high information density—“compasses spun wild and true north became a suggestion” conveys setting, theme, and disorientation in one phrase. Sentence openings vary naturally; paragraph cuts serve emotional beats (e.g., short paragraph for stone release). Minor overwriting in “metaphysical vertigo” slightly strains metaphor coherence, but no loops, scaffold, or purple prose dull the closure. Final line (“spaces between”) resonates without redundancy, fulfilling the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language (“shadows pooled like ink,” “voice thin as starlight”) is consistent and physically coherent. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines (“She realized... She decided...”) but doesn’t loop or dull momentum. High information density in the climax—lock click, diary reveal, fireworks burst—all interwoven without simultaneity errors. One near-redundancy: “catalogue”/“record”/“map” in final paragraphs, but rhythm variation prevents monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “storm of decay and promise” does thematic, sensory, and emotional work in five words. Sentence openings vary (“Elias was…”, “Among his…”, “Late one evening…”), avoiding template cadence. Minor overwriting in “wildflower hush” (repeated thrice) borders on motif-as-mantra but pays off in closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “irrigation streams detached… became silver ribbons” compresses transformation into vivid action. Figurative language is coherent—the “centrifuge of sound” extends the physics metaphor without contradiction. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in the climax (“genetic grief of drought, blight, and survival” borders on label-speak), but closure remains unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is precise and evocative with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors wind’s whisper, closing with resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“sculpted hush” repeated four times). No paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences; each line advances atmosphere or action. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. Minor deduction for slight figurative saturation in high-pressure beats—e.g., “luminous tide that painted the cavern walls with impossible dreams”—but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“sky... bruised purple” borders on cliché; “avalanchingly quiet” strains metaphor coherence). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences summarize regret (“mind full of regret... mistake that cost everything”) without advancing pressure. Sentence openings vary effectively, and paragraph cuts serve emotional beats. Final line (“door closed but not locked”) resonates without redundancy, though “gilded reed flute” repeats slightly more than needed.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line payoff (“glyphs that seemed to shift when stared at,” “stars winked out, as if in sympathy”). Figurative language is pattern-taught: light, math, and sound motifs recur with evolving meaning. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“borrowed personalities clash like cymbals”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence—short, declarative, then lyrical—perfectly modulates closure. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “dragonfly-wing pendant” does triple duty (object, symbol, tool); sentences vary in length and structure to match emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in peak beat (“leaves unfurled like green flames”) borders on mixed metaphor but pays off in thematic resonance. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s repetition of the silver-leafed tree feels intentional—a lyric reprise—not redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. High information density: “frost painted new constellations each dawn on the windows of an ancient Volvo” establishes time, place, mood, and backstory in one breath. Figurative language is coherent—“frozen breath,” “silence rearranged”—never muddled. Final paragraph’s cadence (“The mist withdrew...”) varies rhythm purposefully, avoiding syntactic monotony while sustaining momentum to the last word.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “cardboard hum against her ribs” merges setting/object/emotion. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot or character. Figurative language is coherent (“shadows like trapped fireflies”) and peaks without muddle. Minor overwriting in “time's unraveling tapestry” slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat (“polished by loss it could shine in the dark”) earns its lyricism through accumulated specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“dust like blue snow onto the withering trees” establishes setting, tone, and stakes). Figurative language is coherent (blue = magic/decay/resilience) and peaks cleanly—no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in “grief turned inside-out” slightly strains clarity, but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety supports propulsion; paragraph cuts are purposeful (e.g., mine entrance to descent). No loops or scaffold; every image serves escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“fingers brushed rusted hull plates, tasting the metallic memory”). Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with tension, and figurative language is purposeful (shard “pulsed like a heartbeat out of time”). Minor scaffold in “cyclically spontaneous” repetition—used three times, slightly redundant—but payoff justifies it. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; peak beats avoid purple prose. Final line lands with quiet propulsion, echoing the opening murmur.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “rust on the iron railing and the salt crust on the lantern glass” establishes character, setting, and stakes). Figurative language is pattern-taught (“luminescent ache” recurs with evolving weight). Minor redundancy in “fragile light”/“bottled safety” phrasing slightly dulls peak beats, but no loops or scaffold mar clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“shadows cast… were not mere silhouettes, but ancient echoes”), and rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, slight overwriting appears in peak beats: “shadowed elation” repeats four times, verging on motif churn, and “accidentally prophetic” borders on label-speak. No fatal loops, but minor scaffold in “she continued… each night weaving” slightly dulls final cadence. Otherwise, high propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “valley mist pooled like liquid silver” advances atmosphere and theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (iridescence = truth-tracking) and never muddled in peak beats. Minor redundancy in “quietly explosive” repetition (three times), but each use deepens meaning. Final paragraph’s cadence varies effectively, avoiding template rhythms while sustaining lyric intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “smelled of salt and stardust, remnants of the astronomer who had once charted sorrow”).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (e.g., “woven dawns,” “shards of stars”) and pays off in the climax. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“spiderweb of fractures,” “prism of woven dawns”), slightly blurring clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one near-redundancy exists (“scattered memory shards knitting into a coherent whole” echoes earlier phrasing). Final lines avoid artifact, landing with resonant concision.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“matryoshka dolls of meaning,” “enlarged tranquility”) and high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding syntactic monotony. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“pulsing with questions she wasn't ready to answer”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final lines land with resonant clarity, and the mirror-beat avoids purple prose by tying metaphor directly to action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves,” “heuristically gentle rebellion”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (bread as relic, gardening as question mark). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and the final paragraph’s cadence (“Creeping normality had met its match…”) resonates without overwriting. One minor slip: “provisional as morning mist” slightly echoes cliché, but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but suffers from paraphrase loops: “while illusions fade to memory” repeats verbatim; “luminous vows” recurs without deepening. Template cadence appears in sequences like “He measured… He recorded… He adjusted…” Figurative density is high but occasionally muddles clarity (e.g., “hourglass of ice”). Final paragraph contains scaffolded restatements that dilute momentum rather than crystallizing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“rotting pier like a forgotten promise,” “trust breaking like a splintering mast”) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “fragile echo of trust broken” leans poetic but doesn’t obscure. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve rhythm and tension. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or conflict (“the air tasted of static and old decisions”). Figurative language is coherent—taste metaphors never contradict—and avoids purple excess. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., ring surrender → aurora intensification). Minor deduction for slight over-compression in electoral mechanics, but closure image (“fungi whispers rising like sap”) remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong verbs (“knelt,” “hummed,” “struck”), specific nouns (“charcoal sticks,” “mineral drips”), and varied syntax create propulsion. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats—“sorrowful yet promising,” “quiet, auroral sorrow that sang”—where figurative language slightly blurs immediacy. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp despite lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “recycled breath,” “shredded treasure map,” “magnetic memory.” Figurative language is consistent (botanical/metallic motifs) and never muddled. Minor scaffold in “she spent hours listening, rereading the tapes” slightly flattens momentum, but closure beats are pristine. No loops, purple prose, or simultaneity errors; read-aloud rhythm is assured.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “breath crystallizing in air too thin for sound to carry any meaning that mattered anymore” establishes stakes in 12 words. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is coherent (ice “weeping light,” voice “dissolving into... sounds”). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in “symphonies of truth emerged not as melody but as architecture”—still, rhythm serves pressure, never obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“Static crawled through their circuits like sand across stone”). Figurative language is coherent—fears “pulse,” sap “weeps,” thorns “soften”—without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence (e.g., the single-line “Flame whispered through the tinder”). Final line (“nostalgic for becoming”) recharges the opening nostalgia with earned resonance. Minor deduction only for one slightly ornate phrase (“terror-dimensions collapsing inward”), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “jasmine vines strangled its post,” “sandstorm calm” recur with evolving weight. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with rhythm (short during key discovery, longer in reflection). One minor flaw: “listening heals” appears twice as near-identical phrasing, bordering on scaffold—but it’s thematically justified. No loops, mixed metaphors, or overwriting; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final image (“greatest finds aren’t things you can hold”) recharges the opening premise without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (webs/dance/codes) and payoff-rich. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“each journal entry a silken thread linking her fear of drowning to the power of breath”) edges toward abstraction but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the accumulative drive without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere (e.g., “wrench hang heavy as an anchor” establishes both setting and emotional state). Figurative language is coherent—gravity “mourns in strange, measurable pulls,” silence “pressed against his eardrums like cotton wool soaked in starlight”—with no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (e.g., “time-lapsed glaciers” slightly dilutes immediacy), but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors Charged Poise: short declarative (“He nodded”), then expansive lyricism (“another whale sang…”).

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears (“terrestrially cosmic puzzle” twice, “crystalline tongue” slightly strained). Sentences vary rhythmically, and paragraphs breathe with action. Minor redundancy in “smoothed hush” repetition (three times), but it serves thematic accumulation. Final lines land with clarity and emotional propulsion; no loops or scaffolding obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (building as text, sky as manuscript) without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“burning letters,” “grammar of mortar and memory”) slightly dilutes propulsion but doesn’t obscure causality. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with scene rhythm, and the final line (“ready to stamp the next chapter of agreed-upon lies”) perfectly recharges the core motif with earned irony.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or stakes (“memory could be a quarantine, not a sanctuary”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (resonance as music, garden as membrane) and pays off cleanly. Minor overwriting in “tragically radiant” repetition slightly dulls peak beats, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift obscure clarity. Final paragraph’s cadence shifts subtly to mark resolution without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but suffers from mild overwriting: “pearl twilight” recurs four times, and phrases like “silent storm” or “wound she now sought to forgive” verge on thematic echo. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density occasionally slows propulsion (e.g., two consecutive sentences on stalactites marking time). Final paragraph tightens effectively, though “scent of ink and roses” risks decorative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors like “serpent’s spine,” “throats that swallowed starlight,” and “resonant wound” appear in close succession without pattern-teaching, risking density overload. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“the canyon sang back… the canyon listened… the canyon held its breath”). However, rhythm varies skillfully, and key lines (“her heart, a quiet seashell half”) achieve high information density. Closure image remains clear despite figurative richness.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density (“breath turning to silver mist,” “ribs jutting like broken promises”). Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: “borrowed starlight” repeats five times, risking motif fatigue. One paraphrase loop: “weave truth carefully” appears verbatim twice within 100 words. Otherwise, sentence propulsion is strong, and the final paragraph’s cadence resolves with quiet elegance. No scaffold or simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (“fleeting constellations of light that seemed to echo the hidden patterns woven into the fisherman's nets”), risking figurative density. No loops or scaffold, but one paraphrase-loop: “hidden patterns” recurs without added pressure in mid-story. Final image remains clear despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “reassembling shredded letters was like reconstructing a skeleton from dust” merges metaphor and function. Sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding template cadence. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for one slightly overwritten phrase (“wall of rust and static”) that borders on purple—but it serves the closing image without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“fragmented radio frequencies had leaked through the ionic fracture, singing in voices half-mathematical, half-mad”). Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs (“gnawed,” “stitching,” “braid”) and concrete nouns (“vacuum tubes,” “parabolic dish”). Minor overwriting in “lyrically prophetic cadence stitching quantum hiss into poetry” slightly muddles the vehicle, but peak beats remain clear. No loops or scaffold; final image (“child with cobalt eyes began to speak in forgotten frequencies”) perfectly echoes opening motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“walls breathed sand,” “melody condensed into droplets”) and paid off in closure (“verses that hummed”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; variations in sentence length create organic rhythm. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (“singable light,” “invisible architecture of sound”), but clarity remains intact and closure undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “drift-ice sang back, a chorus of trapped voices” conveys setting, conflict, and theme in one image. Figurative language is coherent (grief as “molten coin,” ice as “crystalline fist”) and avoids purple excess. Sentence variety supports momentum—no template cadence or loops. Minor deduction for slight over-density in climax (“copper and salt on her tongue, a fleshly ethereal sensation…”), but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence multitasks. “The magnetic viaduct arched... its rails gleaming after the last rain had flash-frozen into a skin of light” establishes setting, object behavior, and visual poetry in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; metaphors cohere (“sculpt patience from impatience,” “forge” of waiting). Rhythm varies purposefully: staccato during sensor calibration, flowing during thematic culmination. Final line’s reflection motif pays off without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful: “water seeped… like a slow breath after years of held silence” establishes tone economically. Minor overwriting in one beat (“entangled memories surged…”) edges toward abstraction but is grounded immediately by concrete action. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is consistent (water, light, chains) and never muddled in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled (“dust motes… tiny galaxy,” “silence louder than any scream”) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in “light shot through in a brilliant shaft” edges toward purple, but doesn’t obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Final line (“melody built, broken, and rebuilt”) perfectly echoes structure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose balances density and propulsion: “phosphor-coated grease,” “recursive loop that desired its own improvement” convey complex ideas economically. Figurative language is coherent (resonance “pinwheeling,” patterns “spiraled”) without muddle. Minor flaw: “steadily curious” slightly abstract, but immediately grounded in action. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Final paragraph’s cadence (“eternally curious, eternally ringing”) earns its lyricism through accumulated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and often multi-functional (“the patch... catching the dim light like a stranded star” conveys image, emotion, and theme). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “ghosts in its wires” / “ghosts in the archive’s forgotten corners”; “echo of forgotten songs” repeats verbatim four times, approaching scaffold-loop. Figurative language is dense but coherent. Final third avoids artifacts, though the closing cadence leans slightly ornamental (“across the echo of forgotten songs” x2), preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “amber pools on frozen ground,” “shadows coiled around their boots,” “blood hit the glass and vaporized into light” each advance atmosphere, character, and plot. Sentence variety supports cadence—fragments for urgency, flowing syntax for reflection. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“calm wasn’t emptiness, but a deep listening”) edges toward abstraction but recovers quickly. No loops or scaffold; every image pays off (mirrors reflecting the reconstitution moment). Final paragraph’s rhythmic crescendo (“Empathy wasn’t a soft thing…”) earns its lyricism through prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“Morning light slid across the frozen docks, turning the ice into a mirror of pale gold” establishes time, mood, and symbol). Rhythm varies effectively. One paraphrase loop: “grips reality loosely” appears twice with near-identical phrasing, slightly dulling impact. No scaffold or register drift; figurative language remains coherent. Closure beat is clean, though “windborne solace” recurs a third time, verging on motif overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“vines whisper secrets,” “lantern casting long shadows”) but occasionally over-ornamented (“subtle passion of autumn itself”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one or two adjacent lines verge on synonym repetition (“quiet ache,” “desire… to nurture”). Rhythm varies effectively; final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“The... , the...” openings) and near-paraphrase loops (“murmuring pavilion stood,” “pavilion’s murmuring grew,” “pavilion fell silent,” etc.). Figurative language is consistent (breathing fabric, pulsing stone) but occasionally overused—high-pressure beats lean heavily on metaphor without grounding in physical action. Still, rhythm supports theme, and the final lullaby image lands with earned quietude. Minor scaffold in mid-section slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but mostly controlled; figurative language serves texture without overwhelming causality. However, slight overwriting appears in phrases like “silver nitrate” (technically unnecessary) and “earnest whimsy of her task” (abstract). Minor redundancy in describing the map case twice as “dove gray” and the arcs as both “dance of loss” and “language only the broken could read.” Still, rhythm supports theme, and the final paragraph’s cadence lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: metaphors (“dawn’s gray breath,” “fossil of sound”) cohere within established physics. Minor overwriting in one beat (“fractured sequences: a child… botanist… poet”) slightly slows momentum, but rhythm accelerates effectively toward the climax. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Final line (“each step a testimony against silence”) recharges the core motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line: “spools silent as memory,” “tidal breath matching his own.” Figurative language is consistent (water/time motifs) and never muddled. Minor redundancy in “fog thickened… swallowing sculptures” slightly dulls momentum, but rhythm recovers in the spiral-drawing climax. Final paragraph’s cadence (“turned his back… let the tide carry him home”) perfectly mirrors thematic release. No scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines: “The clock hand spun wildly, never pausing, its frantic motion a blur of silver against the dark dial” establishes motion, mood, and visual contrast in one breath. Figurative language is coherent (time as spin, light as ache) and never muddled. Minor repetition (“luminous ache” appears three times) borders on motif rather than loop, and serves thematic resonance. One slight overwriting in “bittersweet symphony of light and loss,” but closure remains sharp and unblurred.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is cohesive (sea of clouds, vinyl as relic, sound as architecture). Minor overwriting in “poem of finality” and “radiant haven” edges toward abstraction, but not enough to obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Final paragraph’s humming echo perfectly bookends the opening, fulfilling the read-aloud test.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean and vivid, with high information density: “gears clicked, resonating with a low hum” conveys sound, mechanics, and mood. Figurative language is sparse but potent (“brass teeth glinting like frozen starlight”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor deduction for two adjacent sentences repeating “quietly deliberate” (lines 5 and 20), a small redundancy that slightly dulls momentum—but clarity and propulsion remain strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “bone setting could mean more than reassembling skeletons” does thematic, character, and plot work in one line. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor artifact: slight overuse of metaphor in final third (“map not of certainties, but corrections,” “constellations that point to my own failure”) risks density overload, but pattern is taught early (“changeling” folklore) and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—voice remains consistent even in lyric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, though occasional figurative stacking (“serpentine grotto… like a sleeping dragon,” “zephyr bloom, soft and promising”) edges toward overwriting in low-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and sentence openings vary effectively. However, minor register drift appears in phrases like “quiet alchemy” and “collective glow,” which verge on abstract lyricism. These don’t obscure closure but prevent flawless line-level control required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “moss instead of machines,” “honeyed hush,” “green memories” avoid purple excess by grounding metaphors in action. Sentence openings vary (“Three weeks after…”, “She wore…”, “The pendant weighed…”); paragraph lengths breathe with thematic cadence. No loops or scaffold—every line advances character or atmosphere. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “quietly proactive” near climax, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose maintains high information density: “mist coiling around his ankles like a question mark” establishes setting, mood, and thematic doubt in one image. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“ephemeral cameo appearances surface”) slightly dulls momentum, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary (“He came,” “The girl dissolves,” “Against the current”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong verbs (“spun,” “coaxed,” “exhale”) and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“golden and luminous,” “thousand memories”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No paraphrase loops, but one near-redundancy: “gathering hush” appears thrice—functional as motif, yet second use (“air grew thick with…”) edges toward scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence beautifully resolves opening imagery without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “flash-paper igniting in a silent burst” conveys action, soundlessness, and fragility in seven words. Sentence openings vary (“She had traveled…”, “Her hands moved…”, “As the Great Silence deepened…”), and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in “quiet tide of grief and hope” slightly muddles metaphor, but no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line (“path of love safekept in starlight”) recharges the core motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “marble walls now only reflected his own solitary footsteps” conveys isolation, failed function, and acoustic decay in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (echoes as temporal residues, quartz as refractive solution) and never muddled. Sentence variety supports momentum—long descriptive strands for setup, short clauses for climax (“The new mechanism clicked once”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “silence layered upon silence like slate tiles” conveys texture, metaphor, and setting in one image. Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary (“Each spring...”, “Her fingers...”, “Tonight...”). Figurative language is coherent (fractals, calcification, weaving) without muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-density in mid-section (“kerosene lamp burner rested... essential geometry of transformation”), but closure beat (“flameless fire lighting her way”) remains clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“The blank felt heavier than it should, as if it contained the echo of his voice”). Figurative language is coherent—smoke-maned lion, rain as sky-lens—and avoids muddle. Minor repetition (“here and gone”) serves motif, not loop. Final paragraph’s “warmth seep through the cracks of her grief” risks slight abstraction but is grounded by preceding concrete action. No scaffold, filter stacks, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but occasionally over-ornamented (“kinetic lagoon shimmered like a liquid mirror” borders on purple). No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. The phrase “fractured by the silence that dominates this high place” slightly muddles metaphor (can silence fracture words?). Still, propulsion remains strong, and the final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“rusted metal and forgotten fuel,” “brass gleaming like a secret”) and avoids overwriting. Sentences vary in structure and length, creating rhythm that mirrors Mira’s process: measured discovery, focused labor, communal joy. Minor flaw: slight redundancy in “maze of intentions” phrasing and the repeated “flow” motif edges toward insistence without full evolution. Still, line-level craft propels momentum without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme—but risks overwriting in peak beats (“excruciatingly gentle” appears three times, verging on scaffold). Figurative language is mostly coherent, though “spiderwebbed with fractures” slightly clashes with later “silver tooth” gear imagery. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Minor loop in “whispering” repetitions, but closure image (“rain-softened… heart”) earns its lyricism without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “serene upheaval,” “hindsight clarity,” and “thoughtfully clear” verge on label-speak. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“each groan a clue… each line seemed to pulse”). Figurative density is high but coherent; metaphors (city as codex, lies as bricks) are sustained. Final paragraph tightens rhythm effectively, though “weight as a promise” edges toward abstraction. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is purposeful (“rope became a text,” “fog pressed closer”) without muddle. Varied syntax and paragraph lengths create rhythm; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction for slight overuse of “infinitely patient” (twice), but it’s thematically justified and doesn’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “golden leaves that fell like forgotten promises” merges setting, theme, and character perception. Figurative language is coherent (thread as lifeline, map, compass) without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“vivid details: the scent of rain…”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “thrums with a flawed genesis,” “quaking reverie,” “machine-hearted city.” Figurative language is controlled, not excessive. Sentence openings vary; rhythm mirrors thematic tension. One paraphrase loop: “bittersweet” appears three times in close proximity without escalation. Final paragraph slightly over-ornamented (“fractured light of a world neither wholly alive nor dead”), but closure image remains clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Information density is high: “a firefighter whose father had once set fires” establishes conflict in seven words. Minor overwriting appears in adjacent lines like “Her voice carried the weight of her scars, each note a testament to survival” followed by “The bird's eyes brightened...”—a slight paraphrase loop. Yet rhythm varies naturally, paragraph lengths breathe, and the final line crystallizes the arc without redundancy. No scaffold or artifact dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot (“her faint glow casting long, quiet shadows on cobblestones”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (light/moss/silence motifs) and pays off in closure without overwriting. Minor redundancy in “quiet urgency”/“profound hush”/“defiant hush” slightly blurs tone, but not enough to obscure cause/effect. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks—information density remains high even in peak beats like the box opening.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (light/fire/petals/gears) without mixed metaphors. Minor artifact: “quiet sigh of falling petals” repeats three times—functional as refrain, not redundancy—but slightly reduces propulsion in mid-text. Final paragraph avoids scaffold; last line (“dissolved into the waiting mist”) resonates with opening image, closing the loop with earned weight. No filter-verb stacks or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (“stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence”). Figurative language is pattern-taught (candle-flame wings, grief as spiral) and payoff-earned. Minor overwriting in “translucent fingers pointing to the woven ribbon roll”—slightly redundant—but no loops or scaffold. Final line (“grief, like the butterflies, always finds its way home”) risks cliché but lands due to earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“boots crunching black glass that sang against the retreating sea” establishes sound, texture, movement, and temporal pressure). Figurative language is pattern-taught: obsidian as mirror, time as breath, guilt as weight—all cohere physically and thematically. Minor overwriting in “searing reverie” slightly strains register, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors dull the closure. Final paragraph’s cadence (“one careful swing at a time”) perfectly echoes the pendulum’s rhythm, rewarding the Accumulative lens without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in peak beats: “velveteen gloom” appears four times, “calloused yet gentle” twice verbatim, and “uncharted echoes” three times—creating paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Figurative density is high (“stars winking,” “cobalt walls drinking the night”), but metaphors remain coherent. Sentence openings vary well, yet the final third suffers from synonym churn (“tenderly organized,” “fragile strands,” “delicate lace”) that approaches scaffold. These artifacts don’t break closure but prevent 8.0+ due to measurable momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: “ink carried the blue-green memory of open water” conveys hope, craft, and ecology in one phrase. Figurative language is coherent (frost fractures = model branches; spire = black tooth → pen). Minor overwriting in “scaffolded future, groundedly imaginative yet tethered to stone and ice”—slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete prose. Otherwise, zero loops, varied sentence openings, and paragraph cuts that advance pressure (e.g., descent timed with sunrise).

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but suffers minor overwriting: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“dust would catch the music… each particle a tiny storyteller”; “dust motes as scribes… each whisper a line”). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, risking density overload. No scaffold loops or grammar errors, yet the final third’s poetic compression (“cloak of sound,” “horizon of whispered hope”) borders on abstraction, slightly dulling closure’s tactile impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ash still warm against her skin” does emotional, tactile, and thematic work. Figurative language is pattern-taught (mirage, vanishing point, lullaby) and paid off. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“somber marvel” repeated) risks scaffold, but not enough to dull closure. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no loops or template cadence. Final paragraph’s propulsion carries the story out cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “corpse-bloat,” “phosphorescent fungus lamp,” and “thermal fracturing coefficients” each advance setting, character, and theme simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—long descriptive clauses yield to staccato beats during patrol confrontation (“Footsteps splashed… Malach didn’t flinch”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line propels. Figurative language is precise (“human teeth doing the devouring”) without muddle, and the final image (“method endured in metal and mud”) crystallizes theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “defensive jokes, practiced slurs, the static of inherited distrust” compresses social dynamics in 7 words. Figurative language is pattern-taught (negative space → braiding → rosette → leaf veins) and pays off at closure without muddle. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in “thirty autumns of children learn armor before they learned melody”—could breathe more—but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery (“metal ribs bleeding orange,” “composted memories”), and sentences vary rhythmically to match scene tempo. However, figurative language occasionally overloads high-pressure beats—e.g., “cascade of forgotten flavors and stories” followed immediately by “tapestry of laughter, sorrow, and hope”—creating minor density drag. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the phrase “gentle rebellion” appears twice with minimal variation, slightly weakening propulsion. Closure image remains sharp despite these micro-slips.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mechanical bees had been programmed for efficiency, never taught to marvel” compresses backstory into thematic insight. Figurative language is coherent—lightning as nectar, darkness as honey—without mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary (“The lightning collection tower stood…” / “Mara had worked…” / “She pried it free…”). Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Closure image (“sound ripple through the dark streets like a current of pure, uncharged possibility”) earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled; high information density with few loops. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“hushed blaze” appears four times; “shard of hush” recurs with diminishing returns). Final third leans into repetitive cadence (“The quiet bay…”, “The houses…”, “He walked…”), creating a scaffold effect that dulls closure’s edge. No mixed metaphors or grammar errors—just slight overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme (“limestone that formed her bones” ties geology to identity). Figurative language is coherent—water, stone, and poison motifs interweave without contradiction. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“cascade… silt… dissolve”) slightly slows momentum, but closure lines (“whispered into the deep: *Welcome*”) achieve crushing clarity. Zero loops or scaffold; information density high (e.g., “incisively kind” encapsulates moral complexity in two words).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steps were perfect stone, each riser mathematically precise to the nanometer” establishes tone and paradox in one breath. Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—the glitch as “corrupted pixel” pays off the digital-age regret. Final line (“The dice in his pocket settled into a new rhythm”) echoes opening with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme without redundancy. Figurative language is pattern-taught (moonlight as catalyst, smog as antagonist) and pays off in closure. Minor overwriting in “indigo ink mixed with a pinch of crushed starlight” edges toward purple but earns its place by grounding magic in artisanal ritual. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. Final line resonates without echo.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every line advances atmosphere, character, or plot (e.g., “flour dusting their hands like ash” conveys both action and metaphor). Rhythm varies skillfully, and figurative language is coherent—rosewater scent ties waterfall, dread, and hope without contradiction. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high. One slight overwriting moment: “fragile, fragrant hope of a culture that refused to forget” edges toward abstraction, but the preceding concrete images earn it. Final line’s cadence perfectly echoes the opening, closing the sonic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language (“grey finger,” “rotten heart”) serving atmosphere without muddle. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “latent radiance that spilled like liquid silver” and “beam flared, cutting the night with a brilliance that seemed to defy the very stars” edge toward purple prose, slightly dulling immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences near the end paraphrase victory (“defiance,” “monument to belief”). Still, propulsion remains strong, and the final line (“radiance can be found”) cleanly resolves the opening’s gloom.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “ghostlights that clung to objects like oily residue” conveys setting, sensation, and thematic unease in one image. Figurative language is pattern-taught (oil, light, smoke) and payoff-integrated, though the phrase “corrupted gold” slightly overextends the luminance metaphor. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence propels. Final line’s “empty glass and the memory of a lesson” crystallizes closure with rhythmic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high information density: “salt spray silvered her cheeks” conveys setting, embodiment, and mood in six words. Rhythm varies purposefully—staccato for strikes, legato for blue hour—and avoids syntactic monotony. Figurative language is coherent (sound “sketches resonance,” ripples become “indigo ink”) without purple excess. One minor density lapse: “fractal generating” slightly overused, but pattern-taught early and payoff justifies repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “a note that tasted of salt and forgotten language” merges sensory and thematic work. Sentence openings vary (“The city…”, “Kael was…”, “She spent…”), avoiding template cadence. Figurative language is coherent—cracks, spirals, tides form a unified metaphor system without muddle. Final lines (“carved another spiral. The question had finally been heard”) resolve with rhythmic closure, recharging the whistle’s initial failure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative language is dense but largely coherent, with recurring motifs (petals, ivy, rails) reinforcing theme. However, adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“rescue truth from a pit of lies” → “truth could be nurtured”) and passive constructions dull immediacy (“the ledger lay beneath”). Final paragraph’s “truth... climbed into the light” borders on mixed metaphor (truth as plant/vine), slightly muddying the closure image’s physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language (“barnacles blossomed where dancers had spun”) is coherent and grounded. Minor overwriting in two high-pressure beats (“cloud of silt and memory,” “quiet fire against the cold pressure of the deep”) slightly dilutes immediacy but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; rhythm varies naturally to serve scene needs. Final line (“tide rising behind him”) perfectly echoes and recharges the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and often multi-functional, but suffers from recurring abstractions (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”) that verge on label-speak. Two adjacent lines restate Mira’s resolve (“dappled resolve… sharpened her focus like a beacon”), triggering a paraphrase-loop penalty. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph avoids overwriting, though “ripple of tranquilly perceptive clarity” strains slightly. Momentum holds, but scaffold phrases dilute peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense with purpose: nearly every sentence advances character, theme, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent (light as liquid, grief as material to be faceted) and avoids muddle. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual metaphor in peak beats, but rhythm varies naturally and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. The final line—“wakefulness is just another kind of darkness to polish into light”—resolves with perfect echo and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense but clear, with high information-per-line and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught (“intangibly tangible,” “phantom diamonds”) and paid off in the closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift—elevated diction (“perturbation theory”) fits Kael’s expertise. Minor deduction for slight over-compression in one mid-paragraph, but propulsion never stalls; the final lines land with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers image, action, and theme. Figurative language (“stars as characters in universe’s type”) coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in “brilliant dimness” repetition, but pattern pays off. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Final paragraph’s cadence (“Tomorrow would bring…”) echoes opening, creating resonant closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but suffers from moderate overwriting: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., “guilt rose like a tide,” “memories felt like grains of sand”), creating slight muddle. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“heavy silence of regret” / “heaviness that now pressed against his ribs”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, the final paragraph’s “time, unlike memory, could be mended” introduces a conceptual contradiction—time isn’t mended; it’s accepted—which dulls closure clarity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense with multi-tasking lines (“wind-blown stone slick with mist” establishes setting, mood, and physical risk). Rhythm varies effectively, though one or two adjacent sentences verge on paraphrase (“fragile truce carved from centuries of distrust” / “heavy breath of history”). No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; metaphors are consistent (scythe, hinge, tide). Final paragraph’s cadence earns its lyricism without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “merrily melancholic smile masking the compass needle that had stopped spinning” establishes character, object, and conflict in one breath. Minor overwriting in “flickering faith that perhaps mistakes could be unmade” slightly softens immediacy, but figurative language remains coherent (poles as stars, compass as regret). Sentence variety supports emotional arc; no loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence (“walked on with his merrily melancholic heart finally beating in time”) lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, though occasional overwriting appears (“delicately robust walls threatening to collapse under the pressure of forgotten timelines”). Minor paraphrase-loop in describing the lake’s glow across paragraphs. Final third avoids artifacts, and the baseball’s pulse motif pays off cleanly. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense with purpose: “ash settled into the soil, feeding roots that hummed with ancient fire” advances setting, backstory, and theme. Figurative language is coherent (spices as “small suns,” tears as “tiny moons”) and avoids muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“low hum that thickened the air,” “spiral of cinnamon and starlight”) slightly dilutes propulsion, but closure lines (“feral grin that held the warmth…”) earn their lyricism. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “the crack in the saucer was her own body now, opened and luminous”). Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off: ink, cracks, light, and hands recur with evolving charge. Minor overwriting in one beat (“cloudbound repentance flowed through her…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final lines (“map of motherhood written in onyx-ink across the ceremony of breaking”) crystallize theme without summary. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive—every sentence advances character, theme, or pressure. Figurative language (“edges curled like grief itself”) is coherent and payoff-driven. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax (“ecstatic with the terrible beauty of integrated grief”), where one adjective could be cut. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm varies naturally to support emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density: “sandals whispered across black sand” merges sound, setting, and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught (hush, pulse, breath) and payoff-consistent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths breathe with emotional cadence. One minor slip: “phosphorescent insects” slightly clashes with “lightning bugs” established earlier, but not enough to obscure closure. Otherwise, line-level craft propels without scaffold or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density: nearly every line advances plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—e.g., “The lock surrendered with a sigh” contrasts with technical passages. One minor overwriting slip: “phantom gunpowder” slightly strains verisimilitude, but doesn’t obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure beat (“well-oiled click”) lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense with purpose: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Syntax varies effectively—participles for fluidity (“slid up the stone”), fragments for tension (“Friction did not fully return”). Minor overwriting in peak beats (“shard of glass that cut deeper than any knife”) borders on mixed metaphor but doesn’t obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold; information density high (“collapsed star dust… remembered the cosmos”). Closure beat remains artifact-free, though one near-redundancy (“fragile light that promised nothing but the chance to begin again”) slightly softens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is pattern-taught (storms, scars, maps) and coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“seething undercurrent of verses…”) slightly dilutes momentum, but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors resolution—dawn breaking, timer silent, poet stepping into light—earning high information density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence variety supports momentum: short thrusts (“He pressed forward”) alternate with flowing descriptions (“sunlight fracturing…”). High information density—each line advances character, theme, or action. One paraphrase loop: “turning questions into destinations” appears verbatim twice, dulling the final reprise. Figurative language is consistent (music, light, machinery), but “dignified chaos” slightly strains as a repeated motif. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: nearly every line advances character, theme, or atmosphere (“laugh like breaking glass,” “wildflowers cracking pavement”). Figurative language is coherent—rust, seeds, and fractures form a consistent motif system. Minor overwriting in mid-story (“bloomed into quiet resistance needing no name”) slightly softens impact, but no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors dull the closure beat. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support emotional cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information-per-line (e.g., “reels of black-and-white film lay coiled like sleeping serpents” conveys form, mood, and latent danger). Minor overwriting in mid-story (“steely longing that cut through the mist”) borders on purple but pays off in the final “steely longing etched into the wind.” No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One slight redundancy: “horizon invited night” appears thrice, but the refrain reweights meaning each time, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “stone veins holding stories older than the First Drowning” does worldbuilding, character, and stakes in one phrase. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“memory-light, each photon a story”) slightly muddles causality but pays off in closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Final line (“stories stayed rooted, breathing beneath the stone”) earns its lyricism through prior concrete work.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet fluid: “mist that clung to the water like unspun silk,” “pigment emerged as a blue-green shimmer, the exact shade of the ocean through sea glass.” Zero paraphrase loops; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or theme. Figurative language is consistent (tides, diffusion, color) and never muddled. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the “rhythmically placid” voice it describes—proof of syntactic control under emotional weight.
