  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops pervade the text: "gradual change" appears 7 times, "accumulated dust patterns" 3 times, with multiple restatements of the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("Maria's thoughts turned to..." "She had come to realize..." "She realized that...") and abstract scaffolding ("the intricate patterns," "the subtle patterns," "the intricate web") dull momentum without advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "felt a sense of" appears multiple times, "she felt" opens numerous sentences, creating template cadence. Abstract phrases ("sense of peace," "sense of clarity," "sense of gratitude") replace concrete imagery. The final third especially suffers from telling rather than showing ("she knew that," "she felt"), violating the rubric's density requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues: "unshaken marvels" appears three times, "silent world" variants four times, creating template cadence. Abstract inflation pervades: "beauty of nature was preserved like a delicate flower in ice" says little concretely. The phrase "symphony of silence, a beautiful, wordless language" exemplifies the overwritten register. Some strong images ("winterglass," "tuning fork vibrations like ripples") can't offset the pervasive abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("The undertaker felt," "As he," "With") and summary-heavy passages that compress years into single sentences. Key dramatic moments like the underwater descent and lens repair lack scenic detail. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "weary"/"weariness," "stillness"/"rest"/"peace" cycle without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive repetition dulls momentum: "gentle/gently" appears four times, "community" thirteen times, "silver bell" cycles without variation. Template cadence dominates ("As she...," "Akira...") creating mechanical rhythm. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops that restate without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Excessive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "foggy lucidity," "liminal magic," "threshold to the infinite" pile up without concrete grounding. Template spiritual language pervades ("surge of determination," "deep sense of connection," "journey to uncover the secrets of her own soul"). The final third especially suffers from tell-heavy summary that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract inflation ("underlying fabric of reality," "rhythm of the universe") and repetitive conceptual loops about time's nature. Multiple sentences restate similar ideas without added pressure ("The texture of time...was slowly revealing itself" followed by expanded perception descriptions). The writing prioritizes atmospheric description over propulsive momentum, creating a static, contemplative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive abstract language ("testament to," "symbol of," "reminder of") creates distance without concrete imagery. Template phrases repeat: "The liberator knew that..." appears multiple times with similar construction. Information density is low - many sentences restate concepts without advancing action or revealing new knowledge. The prose reads as summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("The sound of trust breaking" appears five times) and template constructions ("As she worked," "As the aurora danced," "As the night wore on"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the redundant explanations of Lyra's synesthesia and the doubled vision statements in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "illuminated moment(s)" appears 5 times, "captured moonbeams" 4 times, extensive scaffold with "Lumina felt/moved/gazed." Template cadence runs throughout ("As the train rumbled," "As they walked away," "As the night wore on"). Abstract padding dominates: "the very fabric of reality was being rewoven" says nothing concrete. Information density remains low with multiple paragraphs reiterating the same vague promises.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "thawing" appears 6 times, "craft/crafting" 10 times, "abandoned control room" 5 times. Template cadence runs ("Elian's thoughts turned to," "As they...") and paraphrase loops ("safe zones for inquiry" restated multiple times) drain momentum. The final third especially suffers from redundant philosophical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structure, though several template phrases appear ("I felt," "I was," "I had been"). The writing achieves clarity but lacks density - most sentences do single duty. Some redundancy in the emotional declarations but no major loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm for the mystical atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "silence deepened"/"world seemed to grow darker" and multiple variations on darkness having texture/life. The story relies heavily on abstract declarations ("fabric of reality was being reshaped") rather than concrete images that would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition problems pervade the text - "remarkably composed" appears four times, "frozen courtyard" seven times, "ice crystal violin" six times. Template cadence dominates with "Zeta had..." constructions, and the final third consists almost entirely of paraphrase loops restating the same realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive abstract loops drain momentum: "freed by honesty"/"freedom"/"being freed by honesty" cycles without advancement; "mistrust and secrecy melting away" appears twice nearly verbatim. Template constructions proliferate: "She had come to realize"/"She began to walk"/"She continued." The prose achieves clarity but lacks density—most sentences restate rather than advance, creating a static meditation rather than propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues: "withered vine dresser" appears 7 times, "garden" 30+ times, creating mechanical loops. Template cadence pervades ("The dresser would...", "As the dresser..."). Abstract descriptors like "poignant reminder" and "testament to" replace concrete imagery. Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same nurturing relationship without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure, though several passages contain unnecessary scaffolding ("As she watched," "As she gazed," "As she stood there"). Some overwriting appears in the climactic sections with stacked modifiers ("shimmering, iridescent mist"). The repeated "icy warmth" phrase feels templated rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive repetition undermines momentum: "Rachel felt" appears 8 times, "seemed to" 6 times. Template cadence dominates ("As she...Rachel..." structure repeats across multiple paragraphs). Abstract descriptors ("haunting and sublime," "beauty that was both") replace concrete imagery. The phrase "in between spaces" appears verbatim three times without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and conceptual loops weaken line-level momentum. Phrases like "hidden truth," "swallowed truth," "provisional and ephemeral" recycle without advancing meaning. Template constructions appear throughout: "Aria felt," "Aria knew," "Aria began." The prose prioritizes philosophical articulation over concrete imagery, creating density without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("As they walked," "As they turned," "As they listened," "As they stood," "As they finished") creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "drowsy alertness" appears twice verbatim, and the "weight of truth" concept cycles without deepening. Information density remains low with many single-function sentences that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "chronicle keeper" drumbeat, multiple paraphrase loops ("witness change without judgment"/"witness to the unfolding of history without judgment"), template cadence in parallel constructions. Lines like "crumbling peace" and "regenerative silence" repeat without evolution. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with many sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: "memory of this moment would stay with Eli forever" followed immediately by "moments that would nurture lifelong wonder." Template phrases like "sense of," "feeling of," and "knowledge that" create filter-verb stacks. The ending particularly suffers from redundant restatements of the same thematic point.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition problems undermine momentum: "seemed to" appears 8 times, creating hedge-heavy prose. Template structures proliferate: "Emilia felt," "Emilia's thoughts," "Emilia's fingers," "Emilia's method." The story repeatedly tells the same information—that the silo holds secrets Emilia wants to uncover—through slight variations rather than advancing. Filter-heavy construction ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to fade," "seemed to shimmer") creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition problems pervade the text: "The Oracle" appears 28 times, "mysterious" variants 6 times, phrases about directing flow and orchestrating repeat without variation. Template cadence dominates ("The Oracle's mind wandered... The Oracle's accidentally prophetic nature stirred... The Oracle's tone was..."). Abstract assertions replace concrete imagery throughout, particularly in claimed transformations that never dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing ("thread by thread," "heart still open") dulls momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the priest's eyes being closed (mentioned 4 times without progression). The text relies on telling ("haunting and beautiful") over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pervasive repetition and loops weaken momentum: "writer" appears 24 times, multiple paragraphs restate the same content about seeking symphonies and hidden harmonies. Template cadence dominates ("The writer's eyes shone... For in the mirrored horizon... As the sun climbed higher..."), and abstract labels replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine prose momentum: "gravity defier" appears 14 times, "ancient clay tablet with runes" repeats verbatim 5 times, and template constructions like "She [verb]" dominate. Paraphrase loops pervade the ending ("The world was remade"/"The world was hers to command"). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues pervade: "Aria" appears 17 times, "cavern" 13 times, "drum maker's cavern" 5 times. Template cadence dominates with "Aria's [noun]" and "As [clause], [clause]" structures. The paraphrase loop of Aria remaining/being present recurs without added pressure, creating momentum drag that dulls any potential closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant overwriting mars momentum: "The stillness was almost palpable" and similar abstractions proliferate. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The piece suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly around tranquility and contemplation, with adjacent sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and redundancy plague the prose: "felt a sense of wonder"/"felt a sense of awe"/"felt a sense of peace"/"felt a sense of gratitude"/"felt a sense of understanding" create template cadence. The story restates the same emotional content across multiple paragraphs without added pressure—Elara's connection to memory and the greenhouse is explained repeatedly rather than deepened through new action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues dominate: "texture of time" (7x), "impossible choices" (5x), "pattern/patterned" (11x), "uncovering layers" (4x), plus extensive paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate without advancing. Template cadence runs ("As she...", "The poet's...") and abstract descriptors ("passionate subtlety," "hidden truths") create prose that feels generated rather than crafted. Information density is extremely low with most paragraphs restating the same conceptual ground.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "chronic hush" appears 7 times with minimal variation; the beauty-in-desolation concept restates across multiple paragraphs without deepening. Template transitions ("As she...") appear 5 times, creating predictable cadence (-0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "luminescent stones" (5x), "amber grotto" (7x), "the dealer" opens most paragraphs. Template cadence runs throughout ("As she..., the dealer..."). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same information about crafting emotions without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Lena felt," "Sophia suggested," "their conversation") and summary-heavy construction. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the friendship theme. Lines like "testament to the cycles of compassion" and "whimsically attentive spirit" read as template phrases rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Kael felt," "began to," "seemed to") and abstract emotional labeling ("sense of peace," "surge of excitement"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the concept of connection and belonging being restated without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.0)
    Significant prose issues undermine momentum: grammatical error in line 6 ("sculpts time itself"), repetitive abstract phrasing about time and echoes, and overreliance on mystical descriptors without concrete anchors. The story suffers from density problems - many sentences restate mystical concepts without advancing action. Template phrases like "forever changed" and "hidden truth" read as writing shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "mathematics of emotion" appears 5 times, "glass eyes" variations 6 times, and template constructions like "The conjurer [verb]" dominate. The final third contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same concepts without advancement, violating momentum requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple instances of paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "kindly methodical soul" appears twice unchanged; "hidden in plain sight"/"remained hidden" repeat the same concept; the dweller "melted back into the darkness"/"disappeared into the labyrinthine corridors" restate retreat. Template cadence runs appear ("The dweller's eyes lit up...The dweller's eyes grew distant...The dweller's smile deepened"). The prose reaches for literary effect but sacrifices clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe repetition loops dominate: the same abstract ideas about transformation cycle through multiple paragraphs without advancement. Template cadence pervades ("As she... Emilia..." repeated 8+ times). The prose relies on telling rather than showing, with key moments summarized in abstraction ("undergoing a subtle yet profound transformation") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops: "sense of unease," "sense of haggard awe," "sense of closure" - emotional labels without embodiment. Template cadence appears: "The more I learned, the more I realized..." Figurative language is sparse and clichéd ("wild goose chase," "bearing down on me"). Multiple paragraphs could be cut without losing story logic.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades with abstract declarations replacing concrete action. Template cadence appears throughout: "Aria realized... Aria discovered... Aria found herself..." Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the redundant final two paragraphs about everyday magic. The prose prioritizes philosophizing over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition undermines momentum: "archivist" appears 19 times, "harbor" 14 times, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "help them heal and rebuild" followed immediately by "heartened the community." The final eight paragraphs spiral through variations of the same "harbor restored/community healed" conclusion without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive repetition weakens momentum: "Emilia felt" appears constantly, "hidden/unspoken truths" cycles without variation, and abstract declarations like "forever changed" substitute for concrete imagery. Template phrases ("With a deep breath," "As she walked") create predictable cadence. The prose tells about mystery and transformation without showing either.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation: "sculpt space for reflection," "topography of the mind," "eternal symphony of the sea." Template cadence appears in "As Emilia..." constructions (lines 15, 18, 21). The piece favors elevated diction over concrete action, creating distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose clarity suffers from overreliance on abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "electric tension," "symbolic gesture") and repetitive sentence openings ("Kael's curiosity," "Kael's connection," "Kael's dimensional awareness"). The story contains multiple filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy, particularly in crucial moments like "Kael understood that the concept of goodbye was not an end." Information density is compromised by telling what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("liquefy the rigid thinking," "deathly vitality") but suffers from repetitive stems ("Lena's father," "She started to think," "Lena felt"). The paraphrase loop about waiting actively appears in lines 10 and 22. Several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle third. The ending accumulates unnecessary scaffolding ("she knew that she was ready," "she would be ready").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues: "stationer's" appears 11 times, "texture(s)" 10 times, creating synonym churn. Template cadence runs through "The stationer's..." sentence openings. Lines like "knowing that she had uncovered a fragment of the world's essence" repeat nearly identical content to earlier statements, creating paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition loops throughout: "The survivor" opens 11 sentences, "The labyrinth" opens 5. Template cadence pervades ("The survivor's [noun] [verb]ed"). Abstract descriptors ("morbid fascination," "purposeful air") replace concrete detail. Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition weighs down momentum: "whispers of the past" appears 5 times, "resonant hums" 4 times, "abandoned observatory" 6 times. Template constructions proliferate ("The myth buster's..." starts multiple sentences). Abstract phrases like "secrets of the universe" and "universal riddle" substitute for concrete detail. The prose loops without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling undermine line-level craft: "sense of unity and purpose," "resilience, of community," "enduring spirit." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly in the final third where concepts repeat without adding pressure. Template cadence runs throughout ("As the days passed," "As the threat drew closer") create mechanical transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "stillness...almost palpable, a dawning hush" appears verbatim twice; "dawnlit" and "moonlit" cycle mechanically; multiple instances of "beauty...fleeting/transience" create loops. Template cadence runs ("As she...," "She wondered...," "Elara's thoughts...") and abstract descriptors ("ethereal beauty," "poignant reminder") replace specific detail. The paraphrase loops in the final paragraphs particularly damage momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "mist-coated rail depot" appears three times, multiple variations of calm/tranquility/serenity, and the ending loops back to nearly identical phrasing from the opening. Template cadence in "Emilia's [noun] was [adjective]" construction. Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("industrious tranquility," "magnetic calm") rather than concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing plagues the text ("Emilia felt," "As she," appears in most paragraphs), with template cadence throughout. Multiple paraphrase loops waste words ("The world was full of mysteries"/"The world was full of wonder"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric padding over propulsion, with numerous scaffolding phrases that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "infinitely patient" appears 4 times, "wild hush" 3 times, "cobblestones" 8 times, creating loops rather than accumulation. Abstract phrases like "fabric of reality" and "harmonious whole" dilute concrete imagery. The text repeatedly paraphrases the same revival concept without advancing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "touches memories, transporting her" followed immediately by "inhaled the scent" repeating the same action; "lonesome splendor" appears twice verbatim; "memories" repeats 7 times without variation. Template cadence runs appear ("As she worked...As she progressed...As time runs short"). The prose relies on abstract telling ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "deep sense of loss") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe repetition issues: "the boy" appears 17 times, "labyrinth" variations 6 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops exist ("seeking answers or escape"/"seeking to uncover the truth"). The phrase "thread the labyrinth with his own story" repeats verbatim. Abstract descriptors like "weight of unknown" and "mystery and wonder" lack concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "resonant awakenings" appears 7 times, "ghost bride" 14 times, "carved stone bead" 5 times. Template cadence runs throughout ("The alchemist felt...," "As she..."). Paraphrase loops abound: lines 19-21 restate the same transformation three ways. These artifacts touch the closure, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition loops damage momentum: "carve a path from ruin to reverence" appears three times verbatim; "orchid solace" twice; extensive paraphrase loops ("testament to the power of art to transform" variants appear four times). Template cadence pervades: "As [time marker], [subject] [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs. The final third consists entirely of restatements without advancing action or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe template cadence issues: "Maya felt," "she felt," "she began to feel" appears in nearly every paragraph. Paraphrase loops abound: "purposeful wandering" restated multiple times, "cautious enchantment" repeated without evolution. The prose tells emotional states through abstract labels rather than concrete embodiment, creating momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("Cipher's heart was already racing with anticipation, eager to discover meaning"). Template cadence runs throughout ("Cipher began," "Cipher's eyes scanned," "Cipher employed," "Cipher carefully transcribed"). Abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "mysterious power") replace concrete specificity. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract assertions about secrets, stories, and mysteries without concrete detail. Phrases like "otherworldly energy" appear twice, and we get variations on "secrets/stories" throughout without specificity. The writing maintains readability but lacks the precision and momentum needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive overwriting and template cadence plague the prose: "Aria's skin had a peculiar attribute," "The air was heavy with," "She carried a small, delicate." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: the singing spirits' voices are mentioned six times with minimal variation. The final third especially suffers from abstract assertions ("testament to the power") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "lotus-hearted ache" appears 3 times, "shared anxieties" 4 times, "brain coral fragment" 5 times. Template cadence pervades ("Kael's thoughts," "Kael felt," "As the"). Abstract emotional labeling replaces concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "forsaken place"/"forgotten place," "rediscover the lost joy"/"rediscovered the lost joy," and the fog/trees/color combination repeats without variation. Template phrasing appears in "She had always been drawn to," "She had been feeling," creating predictable cadence. The final three paragraphs restate the transformation without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("nested awakenings," "kaleidoscope of possibilities") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("seemed to be" appears 5 times, "Lena's [body part]" pattern recurs). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The world, once a fixed and certain place, was now a kaleidoscope of possibilities" essentially restates the prior sentence about "certainty crumbling." The filter-heavy construction in peak moments ("Lena felt," "seemed to be") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "spark of defiance" appears four times, "art of subtle communication" three times, multiple restatements of the same resistance concept. Template cadence dominates ("As the days passed," "As the seasons passed"). The prose tells about events rather than dramatizing them, creating a summary effect that prevents propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition undermines momentum: "beauty/beautiful" appears 7 times, multiple "she felt/knew" constructions, and paraphrase loops like "sanctuary where she could lose herself"/"sanctuary" repeated. Template cadence dominates with "As she [verb]" patterns. The prose achieves occasional lyrical moments but is weighed down by redundancy and scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition undermines momentum: "the caretaker" appears 17 times, often starting consecutive sentences; "forgotten names" repeats 4 times verbatim; paraphrase loops abound ("she continued her work, moving with a gently systematic precision" echoes the opening). The prose achieves atmospheric density but sacrifices propulsion through redundant phrasing and conceptual loops that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation and synonym churn around core concepts ("symphonies of truth," "tangled threads," "web of meanings"). Multiple sentences restate similar ideas without advancement, particularly around Elara's dedication and the archive's atmosphere. The piece relies on telling through elevated diction ("otherworldly light," "fabric of reality") rather than concrete imagery, creating distance from immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues pervade: "As [subject]" appears 8+ times, "Kaelin felt/knew" constructions recur mechanically, and paraphrase loops restate the same content ("harmonizing the conflicting values" stated four different ways). The breathing building metaphor is overworked across multiple paragraphs. These artifacts significantly harm momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "Emilia's thoughts turned," "Emilia felt," "As Emilia watched/gazed/worked" creates template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("a sense of peace settling over her"/"her heart at peace"). The prose achieves basic clarity but lacks propulsion, with multiple sentences restating established information about paper trails and emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract language ("otherworldly energy," "mysterious forces," "hidden patterns") replaces concrete imagery. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" concepts repeated without advancement. Template phrases like "I felt a sense of" appear repeatedly, creating mechanical cadence rather than natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "luminous respite" (5x), "shadowseam wonder" (4x), "softly ingenious" (3x), "forgotten underwater city research facility" (4x full phrase). Template cadence dominates with "As they..." and "The astrologer..." openings. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content without advancement, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The recollectionist" appears 17 times; multiple sentences begin "As she walked/followed/approached." Redundant phrasing weakens momentum: "missing pieces of her past" and "missing pieces of her memory" repeat the same concept. The prose tells emotional states ("felt a sense of wonder and awe") rather than embodying them through concrete action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Elian [verb]" structure dominates, with five consecutive "As" constructions. Abstract descriptors like "orchestrated serendipity" and "calculated wilderness" substitute for concrete imagery. The phrase about "manipulating odds to create wonder" appears in slight variations three times.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "weathered stone," "otherworldly light," "obsidian grace," "swirling vortex" stack without purpose. Template cadence: "As she stood there" appears three times; "Aria felt," "Aria knew," "she knew that" create filter-verb repetition. The phrase "beyond measure" and similar abstractions replace specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops plague the piece - multiple paragraphs restate the same content about hidden patterns and beauty beneath surfaces without added pressure. Template cadence ("The glazier..." "She felt..." "She knew...") creates mechanical rhythm. Abstract phrasing ("clear complexity," "noctilucent reckonings") substitutes for concrete imagery, and the final third consists entirely of summary without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "cracked porcelain box" appears 8 times, "seemed to" constructions proliferate, and paraphrase loops abound ("scarred forest firefighter"/"scarred firefighter"). Template cadence runs through "As he [verb]" patterns. These artifacts significantly dull momentum and violate the loop/scaffold screen.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "trial balloons...carefully crafted ideas designed to test the limits" restates the same concept. Template phrasing appears throughout ("She saw herself," "She felt," "She knew"). The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from abstract declarations ("serene upheaval," "infinite possibilities") that don't advance concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe template cadence with "The cartographer" or "As the cartographer" opening most paragraphs creates mechanical rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "uncovering the secrets"/"uncover them," "legacy's burden"/"weight to be carried," "walls' dreams"/"dreams that its walls held." Abstract phrasing like "testament to the lives" and "enduring legacy" replaces concrete imagery in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "prism parapet" appears 8 times, "coded lullaby" 5 times, "possibilities" 7 times. Phrases like "seemed to" appear 11 times, creating hedge-heavy, tentative prose. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content ("The mirrors seemed to be responding...The mirrors seemed to stir"). Template cadence runs throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "ebony clipboard" appears 7 times, "price of redemption" 4 times, "ritual significance" 3 times. Template phrases like "began to," "seemed to," and "sense of" create filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop between "negotiations progressed" and "negotiations edged closer" exemplifies the synonym churn throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling weaken line-level craft: "destructive power of greed," "sense of fractured grace," "deep sense of satisfaction" substitute labels for concrete experience. Template phrases like "As she looked out," "As she walked," "As the storm" create repetitive cadence. The transformation sequence relies on assertion rather than sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive abstraction ("weight of expectation," "cascade of echoes," "seismic shift") replaces concrete imagery throughout. Template cadence dominates with repetitive "As she..." constructions, while paraphrase loops appear frequently ("becoming lighter, freer" / "shedding the weight"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition loops dominate: "decommissioned radar dome" appears 7 times, "campfire story stick" 5 times, "meteor hush" 3 times without evolution. Template cadence pervades ("As she...", "She had...", "Amaranth felt..."). Paraphrase loops abound: "challenge her audience's assumptions"/"make them question" repeat the same idea. Filter-heavy construction dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.8)
    Heavy repetition plagues the prose: "moth wing" appears 6 times, "structures" 5 times, variations of "honor/overlooked histories" 6 times. Template cadence runs throughout ("Aria's eyes were closed... Aria's eyes snapped open... Aria rose to her feet... Aria felt..."). The phrase "otherworldly light" repeats verbatim. Information density remains low with multiple paragraphs restating the same thematic content.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "Akira" appears 17 times in 33 sentences, creating monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops exist ("preserve the sound of forgotten names" variants appear 5 times). Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" and "Akira [verb]" openings. The prose tells emotional states ("deep sense of satisfaction") rather than embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("testament to forgotten endeavors," "complex dance of understood events," "ethereal grit") creates opacity without purpose, while template constructions repeat ("Hindsight moved," "Hindsight approached," "Hindsight rose"). The paraphrase loop in the final two paragraphs restates walking into possibility without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades every paragraph with purple prose like "shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake" and "twilight and stardust." Massive redundancy - the story essentially repeats the same abstract claims about harmony and transcendence without advancing. Template cadence appears throughout ("The astronomer's..." starts multiple paragraphs). Mixed metaphors and register drift into academic abstractions undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("ebbs and flows of life," "cycle of suffering," "transformative power") replaces concrete action and image. Template cadence appears in repetitive "It was..." and "As..." constructions. The prose relies on telling about concepts rather than showing through specific detail, with particularly egregious summary in the final paragraphs about years passing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues include "shimmer of twilight frost" (3x), "glass mountains" (7x), and template cadence in "The mirror maker's..." constructions. The prose relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("otherworldly," "ethereal," "inexplicable") rather than concrete imagery, and multiple paraphrase loops restate the boundary-erasing concept without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elara's presence...was not a coincidence; it was a deliberate choice") and abstract summary that could be cut without loss. The opening sentence contains an awkward grammatical construction. Multiple paragraphs restate the same thematic content about vows and wisdom without adding pressure. Information density is low with excessive scaffolding around the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and tell-heavy prose: "felt a sense of purpose," "sense that they were being drawn," "felt their understanding shift." Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same transformation concept without advancing specificity. Template phrases like "curiosity got the better of them" deflate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive telling over showing: "Elara was carefully resourceful," "she quickly realized," "had earned his trust." Template cadence appears in "As they... Elara and the time traveler..." constructions. The paraphrase loop "she had found something far more valuable... she had found a new path" weakens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant redundancy appears in adjacent sentences: "The stories were fragmented and disjointed" followed immediately by "The narrative threads were complex and multifaceted" creates a paraphrase loop. Template phrasing like "Lyra felt," "Lyra knew," "Lyra found herself" creates repetitive stems. The metaphor "trapped freedom" attempts profundity but reads as oxymoronic ornament rather than earned paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive filter verbs ("Emilia felt" appears 5 times, "she noticed/sensed/realized" throughout) create distance and repetitive cadence. Template phrasing dominates action sequences ("As she looked around," "As Emilia watched," "As she descended"). Paraphrase loops abound: "threads of knowledge" and "merging threads" repeat the same concept without advancement, while "warmly methodical" and "warmly approving" recycle descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "The mapkeeper" opens 13 sentences, "began to" appears repeatedly, extensive paraphrase loops (paragraphs 15-16 restate the same satisfaction). Template cadence runs throughout ("She held...She studied...She conjured"). Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating rather than advancing. Filter-verb stacks and abstract descriptors ("gentle luminosity," "harmonious frequency") replace concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence undermine momentum: "The custodian felt a shiver... The custodian felt a surge..." repeats across multiple paragraphs. Abstract declarations ("overwhelming uncertainty," "deep and abiding sense of purpose") replace concrete imagery. The phrase "thistle-blown" appears three times without evolving meaning, reading as forced motif rather than organic recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "collective memory" appears 7 times, "crystal whispering forecourt" 5 times, variations of "stood there" 4 times. Template cadence pervades: "As she [verb]," "She [verb]," creating mechanical rhythm. Abstract language ("weight of her task," "sense of reverence," "powerful thing") replaces concrete imagery in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition problems pervade the text: "Lyra" appears 29 times, often starting consecutive sentences; "chants/chanting" repeats 7 times; multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content ("her mind was ablaze with ideas"/"armed with a newfound sense of purpose"). Template cadence runs throughout ("As she...", "Lyra's..."). The prose lacks density, with many sentences doing single jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "warmly observant" appears three times, "contemplative silence" twice, "jade cicada" eight times without evolution. Template cadence dominates ("As she...," "The chronicler..."). Information density is low with multiple paraphrase loops describing the same observational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around "gilded hush" (6 instances) and "flavors of silence" that becomes mechanical. Template cadence appears in lines 23-26 where "Eli" starts consecutive sentences. The metaphor "seeds taking root in fertile soil" followed immediately by "growth that had sprouted" creates redundant botanical imagery that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "gondola operator" appears 15 times, creating mechanical cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "silence that remained was almost palpable" echoes earlier "almost palpable stillness." Template phrases like "seemed to be" appear 7 times. The prose achieves atmospheric description but lacks propulsion and contains multiple synonym churns around stillness/quiet/silence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting plagues the prose: "futuristic nostalgia," "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "iridescent bark," "shimmered like stardust" stack ornamental descriptors without advancing pressure. Template phrases repeat ("Aria's gaze fell upon," "Aria felt," "Aria knew"). The final three paragraphs loop the same "new era/claimed throne" content without adding information.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction weakens line-level craft: "melancholy mood," "tender nature," "calculated actions" tell rather than show. Template cadence appears in "The keeper's [noun] was [adjective]" construction repeated throughout. Mixed metaphors ("shadows like dark tentacles wrapped around the keeper's heart") muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Lyra began to," "Lyra felt," "Lyra knew") and abstract descriptors ("strange occurrences," "incredible levels," "truly remarkable"). Multiple filter-verb constructions ("felt an inexplicable connection," "began to notice") dull immediacy. Several telling phrases replace scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition plague: "dynasty ender" appears 16 times, "golden shadows" 4 times, "standing waves" 4 times, creating numbing loops. Template cadence dominates: "The dynasty ender [verb]" structures repeat mechanically. Abstractions like "hidden truth," "deeper significance," and "newfound understanding" replace concrete imagery. The prose reads as mystical word-salad rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition issues pervade the text: "shape of possibility" appears 7 times, "murmured allegiance" 4 times, "reality shifted/continued to shift" 4 times, creating loops rather than progression. Template cadence runs throughout ("The knight's [noun] [verb]," "As [event], the knight [action]"), and abstract mystical language replaces concrete action in nearly every paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops and redundancy throughout: "forgotten stories"/"forgotten memories"/"forgotten dreams"/"forgotten past" appears seven times; "sanctuary of remembrance" repeats verbatim. Abstract emotional declarations ("heart swelled," "sense of purpose grew") and template constructions ("As she worked," "As Emilia worked," "And as she worked") create mechanical rhythm. The final three paragraphs essentially restate the same transformation without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("testament to the spirit of resistance," "tyranny of indifference," "fabric of the established order") creates distance from concrete action. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts ("resist the creeping indifference," "against the apathy," "counter the tyranny of indifference"). Template cadence appears in "She had been...But now...As she made her way" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "mist" appears 19 times, "grotto" 9 times, "prism atrium" 7 times, creating numbing loops. Template cadence dominates ("The mist swirls," "The mist begins," "The dewdrops continue"). Paraphrase loops abound: multiple sentences restate the music's calming effect without advancing pressure. These artifacts pervade the entire piece, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "The seed sorter" opens numerous sentences, "emerged/emerging transformed" appears multiple times, and paraphrase loops abound ("a place of eerie beauty" followed immediately by description of that beauty). Template cadence ("As she worked," "As she finished") and abstract descriptors ("otherworldly," "ethereal," "mystical") replace specific detail. The final paragraph merely restates earlier assertions about transformation without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "Elian felt" appears four times, "seemed to" five times, creating filter-verb stacks that distance the reader. Template cadence runs throughout ("As he...", "The sound of...", "It was...") and the phrase "uncertainly certain" forces the required attribute without natural integration, creating artificial rather than organic prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "weight of names" appears 4 times, "luminous regret" 3 times, "factually mystical" 2 times without evolution. Template cadence dominates ("As she...Elara," "The foundry...had become," "In this...Elara"). Abstract phrases like "intricate dance between reality and the unknown" and "depths of her own soul" provide no concrete imagery. The prose reads as paraphrase loops rather than progression.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition issues: "modestly fearless" appears twice, "distorted notes" three times, "luminous ache" twice. Template phrasing pervades ("She approached cautiously," "She followed the sound," "She turned to pursue"). The final third especially suffers from abstract assertion ("beacon of hope in the darkness") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("pulsing light," "ultraviolet forest" appears 6 times) and abstract declarations ("otherworldly energy," "sense of displaced rooted-ness"). Template cadence appears in "Elara's gaze drifted...She knew that...The forest was said..." sequence. Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar content about confronting trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.3)
    Template cadence pervades: "Lena felt," "She knew," "As she" repeat across paragraphs. Abstract phrases ("anchors of intuition," "eternal instant," "elusively tangible") recur without gaining specificity. The prose relies on telling over showing, particularly in emotional beats ("felt an overwhelming urge").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing: "weight of forgotten dreams," "weightless burden," "secrets hidden," "stories lie hidden." Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "abandoned places"/"forgotten place," "uncovered the secrets"/"uncover the secrets." The metaphor "fluorescent lights hang like skeletal fingers" stands out but such specificity is rare.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive redundancy undermines momentum: "rustling awakenings" appears 6 times, multiple paragraphs restate the same abstract concepts ("destabilize perfect systems," "compress eternity"). Template phrases like "It was said that" and "The operator knew that" scaffold rather than propel. The prose prioritizes atmospheric accumulation over clarity and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "reimagine/reimagined" appears 7 times, "burnished sorrow" 4 times, "secrets" 6 times, creating paraphrase loops that drain momentum. Template cadence runs ("As she..." structures) and abstract declarations ("a window into a world long lost") replace concrete imagery. The prose achieves occasional lyric moments but drowns them in redundant philosophical musings.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades with purple mystical descriptors: "whispers of a thousand midnights," "labyrinthine passages," "palpable aura of tinkersong wonder." Paraphrase loops appear: "mend what wasn't torn, to restore the essence" repeats the same concept. The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over narrative momentum, creating sluggish pacing through abstract mystical claims.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "resonant hush" appears four times, similar phrases about stillness/presence/mystery recycle throughout. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "mystical realm," "subtle frequencies") replace concrete imagery in peak moments, dulling immediacy. The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices precision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling dominate: "possibilities," "deep significance," "creative energies surging" without concrete embodiment. Template phrases recur: "Aria's attention was caught," "Aria's mind began to whirl," "Aria's thoughts turned to." The prose scaffolds around vague intensifiers ("seemed to," "sense of") that dull immediacy. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content about hidden connections across adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems pervade: "umbral tenderness" appears 4 times, "dawning hush" 3 times, "amber pavilion" 5 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("Luna's understanding expanded"/"Luna knew she had found"/"Luna had finally begun to understand"). Template cadence dominates with "Luna [verb]" or "As [temporal], [subject] [verb]" structures. The abstract diction ("resonant reconfiguration," "profound understanding") creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "Naomi felt" appears repeatedly, "continued" recurs unnecessarily, and paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("secrets waiting to be unlocked"/"secrets it held"/"secrets were fully revealed"). Template cadence dominates ("As she...," structures repeat). The final paragraph loops the same "continue/return/uncover" concept three times without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "the alchemist" appears 29 times creating template cadence; phrases like "the alchemist's eyes," "the alchemist's hands," "the alchemist's thoughts" loop mechanically. Abstract declarations ("reimagine the entire civilization," "breathe new life") replace concrete action. Multiple paraphrase loops: "revival and rebirth"/"reborn from the ashes," "crumbling structures"/"crumbling buildings."

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues pervade the text: "seemed to be" appears 11 times, creating template cadence; "The scribe's" opens multiple sentences; concepts loop without advancement ("velvet disquiet" restated, emotional patterns "pulsing" repeatedly). Abstract phrases like "tangible representation" and "profound influence" replace concrete imagery. These artifacts significantly dull momentum and obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "feeling a deep sense of wild serenity" immediately after establishing she smiled with contentment; "armed with the knowledge...and the determination" restating her readiness. Template phrases like "overwhelming sense of," "familiar tug of," "strange sense of" create mechanical emotional reporting. The abstract density of phrases like "texture of borrowed time" and "decreasing entropy" obscures rather than enriches, particularly when clustered in the closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction weighs down the prose: "intricacies of the sanctuary's unique microclimate," "subtle rhythms," "hidden patterns." Template phrases like "As she went about," "As the days passed," "In this way" create scaffold rather than propulsion. The final paragraph especially suffers from tell-heavy construction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition loops throughout: "flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," "spiritually curious," and "strength in vulnerability" cycle without variation or development. Template cadence pervades ("The janitor's..." opens 7 sentences). The prose states rather than dramatizes, with abstract philosophizing replacing concrete action (-1.4 for pervasive loops touching closure).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant paraphrase loops appear throughout ("weight of unspoken words" repeated three times, "memories"/"remembrance" cycling). Template cadence runs dominate ("The recluse's gaze..." opens multiple sentences), and abstract descriptors ("haunting echo," "otherworldly glow") replace specific detail. The final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("even in the most desolate of worlds, there was still beauty") replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive repetition and paraphrase loops dominate: "The timekeeper's understanding grew, so too did their connection" immediately follows similar statements. Template cadence appears throughout ("The timekeeper's [noun]," "As they [verb]"). Abstract descriptors like "anticipated mysteries" and "suddenly timeless quality" replace concrete detail. The final third especially suffers from synonym churn around discovery/understanding/revelation without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetition loops weaken momentum: "beauty/beautiful" appears 11 times, variations of "world" 13 times, "gentle/gently" 5 times, creating synonym churn rather than purposeful accumulation. Template structures recur ("She felt... She was... She smiled..."). Abstract assertions replace concrete imagery in key moments: "channeling it into her art" and "a truth that would stay with her forever" tell rather than show the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetition mars the prose: "caretaker" appears 27 times, "gently systematic" repeats verbatim, and template phrases like "As they [verb]" recur mechanically. Paraphrase loops abound: "foster interspecies respect"/"promote a deeper understanding"/"promote a sense of respect and reciprocity." The text reads as an extended summary rather than immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "skeptic" appears 20+ times, creating mechanical cadence. Template structures dominate ("As they...," "The [noun]..."). Paraphrase loops abound: "bronze quiet" deepening is restated without advancement. Multiple sentences restate the same atmospheric or conceptual content without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition issues: "blooming" appears 7 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("garden reborn from the ashes of a battlefield" / "letting a garden reclaim a battlefield"), and template phrases ("testament to," "filled with the sweet scent"). The prose lacks the concision and momentum expected at this level, with multiple sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "wild hush" appears twice, multiple "sense of" constructions, repeated "Lyra and Kael" phrasing. Template cadence runs appear ("As they...", "The...was..."). Information density is low with many single-function sentences that could compress. The paraphrase loop about belonging/purpose in the final third particularly dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting and redundancy plague the prose: "haunting monument, a relic of a bygone era" doubles the same concept; "vast, empty space" adds nothing to "desolate deck"; multiple paragraphs restate Aria's wonder and determination without advancing. Template cadence appears in "Aria felt," "Aria began," "Aria smiled" constructions that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive template phrasing weakens momentum: "Moonwhisper's thoughts turned to," "it was said that," "they knew that." Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same information (sky distorted/wrong/erratic). The prose relies on telling phrases like "feeling a sense of pride" rather than embodied showing. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive repetition loops ("whispering gallery" 5x, "crisis actor/survivor" paired repeatedly, "luminous absence" 3x) and template cadence ("As they..." structures). Abstract phrasing ("shadowy realm," "tapestry of meaning") replaces concrete action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting pervades: "air of quiet contemplation," "practiced intensity," "inexplicable jolt of recognition," "swirling mists." Template phrases accumulate: "It was said that," "And it was this," "And so." The prose tells emotional states ("deep sense of satisfaction") rather than embodying them. Abstract descriptors ("profound and mysterious") replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing plagues the text: "With a [adjective] [noun]" appears four times, "As he" opens multiple sentences, and abstract descriptors like "expectant hush" and "fierce repose" recur without gaining meaning. The prose relies on telling ("felt reborn," "spirit renewed") rather than concrete imagery, creating a gauzy effect that dulls momentum. Template cadence runs throughout middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe template cadence problems throughout: "The [noun] [verb]" pattern dominates. Paraphrase loops abound - the final six paragraphs restate identical content about art revealing truth. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") replace concrete dramatization in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" appears three times verbatim, "kintsugi intentions" four times, "quilted together" three times. Template cadence dominates ("As she...," "The statue...," "Kaelin...") creating mechanical rhythm. The phrase "acid sea churning" and its variants appear five times without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive redundancy weakens momentum: "temporary eternity" appears five times without evolution; "intimately aloof" twice as mere label. Template constructions proliferate ("As she worked," "As she gazed," "As the sun dipped"). The final third abandons scene for summary, with phrases like "Years would pass" deflating immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops plague the text: "vibrations of intent" appears six times, "gentle, insistent voice" three times, "screaming tenderness" twice without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs throughout ("Elian felt...Elian stood...Elian opened"). Abstract philosophizing ("hidden patterns and unseen connections") replaces concrete imagery in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive structures ("The navigator..." opens multiple paragraphs) and exposition-heavy telling that summarizes rather than dramatizes key beats. Lines like "slowly but surely" and "long and arduous" are generic placeholders, though some specific images ("patina bronze censer foot") provide texture. The final paragraph achieves better rhythm but can't overcome the accumulated drag.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing dominate: "curiosity was piqued," "interest was sparked," "sense of resolve." Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same content ("fractured grace" appears three times). The prose tells about searching and discovering without showing specific actions or sensory encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition problems: "witnessed isolation" appears three times, "softly persistent" twice, multiple variations of "Kael watched/noticed/observed." Template cadence dominates ("Kael knew that," "Kael realized," "As the stranger"). The phrase "a key" literally repeats in adjacent paragraphs. These loops and scaffolds pervade the text, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pervasive repetition and scaffold sentences drain momentum: "lingering promise" appears four times, "doorway of decisions" three times, "type foundry matrix chip" six times without variation. Template cadence dominates ("As she ventured deeper..." "As she explored..." "As the night deepened..."). The prose lacks information density, with many sentences restating rather than advancing: "With a newfound sense of purpose" merely summarizes what should be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "sense of" appears 7 times, "felt" 8 times as a filter verb, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "mystery of the recurring dreams"/"mystery of the bleeding starlight" and multiple variations of approaching/entering the grotto. The phrase "bleeding starlight" repeats 6 times without evolution. Information density suffers from scaffolding that restates without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems plague the prose: "sense of" appears 11 times, "she had" opens multiple sentences, and paraphrase loops abound ("unlock its secrets"/"uncovering its secrets"). Template cadence runs throughout ("As she worked," "As she turned," "As she finished"). The final third especially suffers from redundant restatements of the same insights.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "feral nostalgia" appears 6 times, "birch bark scroll" 8 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("I'd created something special"/"I'd discovered a new sense of purpose").

    Severe repetition problems: "trembling calm" appears 4 times, variants of "unveiling ordinary miracles" 3 times, "occluded views" 3 times. Template cadence pervades: "As she [verb], Elara [verb]" repeats across multiple paragraphs. Abstract phrasing ("emotional terrain," "hidden patterns and connections") replaces concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant prose issues undermine momentum: repetitive structures ("Kaito felt," "Kaito's mind," "Kaito hoped"), abstract emotional summaries ("overwhelming urge," "surge of inspiration"), and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements of transformation/scar themes). The phrase "saturated hush" appears twice verbatim. Template cadence pervades: "As [X], [Y]" constructions appear seven times, creating mechanical rhythm that dulls the meditative atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive overwriting dulls momentum: "palpable sense of anticipation that seemed to vibrate through every molecule" and "ethereal beauty that lay just beneath the surface" exemplify the purple prose throughout. Template phrases like "she felt," "she knew," and "as she did" create filter-verb stacks that distance the reader from immediate experience, particularly damaging in would-be peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose like "shelves that stretched like sentinels into the darkness" appearing in most sentences without payoff. Template cadence problems emerge in repetitive constructions ("As she...," "In the...," "The..."). Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the redundant variations on unity/harmony/balance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition problems plague the prose: "shepherd" appears 34 times, creating numbing loops; phrases like "ever watchful," "ever vigilant" recycle; multiple paragraphs restate the same content about monitoring clocks without advancement. Template cadence ("The shepherd's [noun]...") and paraphrase loops drain momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and repetitive phrasing weaken line-level craft: "familiar strangers" appears 5 times, "understanding/understand" 10 times, creating synonym loops. Template cadence dominates ("As she walked," "As she reached," "As the sun rose"). The prose relies on telling abstractions ("quiet wildfire," "profound discovery") over concrete imagery, particularly in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive repetition and paraphrase loops plague the prose—the candle lantern "glows" identically four times, "clover melancholy" appears twice without evolution. Template cadence dominates ("As she...", "She began...", "She would..."). The final third contains multiple instances of abstract summary replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops throughout: "loop" appears 8 times, often restating the same concept. Template cadence in "The operator [verb]" constructions. Lines 15-17 repeat the connection theme without adding pressure. The prose achieves atmosphere but lacks propulsion—many sentences could be removed without losing information.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition loops plague the text: "weight of small moments" appears 5 times, "haunted euphoria" 3 times, "gently thorough" 3 times, "regenerated covenant" 3 times. Template cadence runs dominate ("The archivist..." begins 11 sentences; "She..." begins 8). The final third abandons scene entirely for repetitive summary statements about preservation and love's power.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract summarizing ("atmosphere began to shift," "sense of community," "feeling of possibility") replaces concrete scene work. Multiple paraphrase loops (community/connection/companionship recycled without advancement). Template phrasing like "As the night wore on" appears twice. The prose lacks propulsion, reading more like an outline than dramatized fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("The mapmaker's..." appears 11 times) and paraphrase loops dilute momentum—multiple sentences restate the journey's purpose without advancement. Abstract phrasing like "quiet blaze," "fabric of reality vibrate," and "labyrinth of sorrow" accumulates without concrete grounding. Filter constructions ("felt," "seemed") distance key moments, and the final paragraph loops the opening without meaningful reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several abstract passages slow momentum ("understanding the power of altering narratives, and the responsibility that came with it"). Some repetitive phrasing appears ("began to," "sense that") and the density of abstract concepts in places reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "whispering advisor" appears 7 times, "luminous harbor by moonlight" 4 times verbatim, creating template cadence. Abstract phrases like "joyful sorrow" and "mapping silence" repeat without gaining specificity. The prose achieves some lyrical effects but suffers from paraphrase loops: "even when no one remembers you" restated multiple ways without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling dominates: "Elian felt themselves drawn closer to the truth" exemplifies the pattern of summary over scene. Template phrasing appears throughout ("As they...", "With a..."), creating mechanical rhythm. The prose relies on elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies concrete action, particularly in supposed peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "Aria felt" appears 6 times, "seemed to" 5 times, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "entangled memories" concept restated multiple times without advancement. The phrase "sound wave garden" appears 7 times without variation. Abstract descriptors ("otherworldly glow," "profound stillness") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("She [verb]" dominates) and abstract telling ("calculated spontaneity that drove her"). Some effective images ("chorus of restless spirits") compete with vague assertions ("different kind of energy was building"). The final paragraph loops the whisper concept without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition issues: "stillwater tension" appears four times, "silent empathy" three times, creating paraphrase loops. Template cadence dominates ("The guardian [verb]," "The figure [verb]"). Abstract descriptors ("intricate," "complex," "mesmerized") replace specific detail. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn pervade peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing dominate: "sense of purpose" appears twice, "newfound" constructions repeat, and vague intensifiers ("inexplicable pull," "otherworldly energy") substitute for specificity. The recursive structure creates intentional echoes but also enables paraphrase loops - the final paragraphs essentially restate earlier material without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: abstract phrases like "combative tenderness," "insatiable hunger to find freedom," and "guardian of the sea's secrets" create opacity rather than clarity. Template constructions appear throughout ("It was said that," "As she [verb]"), and the final third relies on telling rather than showing the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose ("sentinels in the distance," "shroud," "talismans against darkness") and constant paraphrase loops—nearly every concept gets restated 2-3 times. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Echo's [noun] was" constructions. The phrase "remade hush" appears three times without evolving meaning. Information density is extremely low with most sentences merely elaborating mood rather than advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and abstract redundancy pervade the piece—multiple sentences restate Lyra's transformation without adding pressure or detail ("boundaries dissolving," "limitless possibility," "forever changed"). Template cadence appears in "Lyra felt..." constructions repeated across paragraphs, and abstract terms like "essence," "profound," and "transformative" replace specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition loops plague the text: "beauty of imperfection" variants appear 8+ times, "bartered awakenings" repeats without evolution, "courtyard" cycles mechanically. Template cadence dominates ("The painter...The glassblower...The courtyard..."). Abstract telling replaces concrete image throughout - "whirlwind of creativity" and "hub of creativity" substitute for specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "bell ringer" appears 24 times, often multiple times per paragraph. Template structures repeat ("The bell ringer...," "As the..."). Abstract telling dominates over concrete showing ("felt a deep sense of satisfaction"). The meta-commentary ending "However, to meet the word count" is an egregious artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "mourning jewelry maker" appears 13 times, creating template cadence. Abstract descriptors ("otherworldly light," "ethereal light," "soft light") blur rather than sharpen. The prose relies on telling ("felt a deep sense of connection") over concrete imagery. Multiple paraphrase loops exist, particularly in the final third where emotional states are restated without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems pervade the text: "cartomancer" appears 24 times, "patterns" variations 8 times, multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts. Template cadence ("As the...the cartomancer...") recurs throughout. The prose lacks propulsion, with many sentences doing single duty rather than advancing multiple story elements. These artifacts significantly dull the attempted closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract language and template phrases weaken line-level craft: "haunted her for years," "flickering light cast eerie shadows," "forever changed." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the transformation theme—lines 16-19 restate the same "profound change" concept without advancement. The prose relies on telling over showing, with pivotal moments summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("The dusk noticer felt," "she began to," "As she") and abstract terminology that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("shape of hope"/"flame burning bright," "luminous regret" used twice identically). Several sentences restate rather than advance ("darkness that was not quite there, yet not entirely absent either"). Information density is low for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops pervade the text—"reconstructing her understanding" appears in variations at least six times without advancing meaning. Template cadence runs throughout ("Lena felt," "Lena's thoughts turned," "Lena knew"). The metaphor of "shedding layers" is repeated mechanically without development, creating synonym churn rather than progression.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "Elian" appears 17 times, often starting consecutive sentences. Abstract phrases like "tissue of reality," "displaced miracle," and "stories in scars" repeat without gaining specificity. Template constructions ("As they...," "The [noun] was...") dominate. The prose relies on telling over showing, particularly in the rushed final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing plague the prose: "testament to the enduring power" appears twice, "sea of correspondence," "autumn leaves on a gusty day" are stock metaphors. Paraphrase loops abound: "unused love"/"enduring power of love"/"love that continued to resonate." The filter-verb stack in peak moments ("felt...knew...realized") kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.3)
    Extensive repetition dulls momentum: "stardust remembered/remembered stardust" appears multiple times, "shadowed rapture" repeats verbatim, and abstract phrases like "hidden patterns and connections" proliferate without specificity. The prose relies on mystical abstractions ("otherworldly energy," "pure enchantment") rather than concrete imagery, creating atmospheric fog rather than sharp scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "ethereal glow") and repetitive phrasing ("Asa's [action]" appears 7 times). The paraphrase loop in "channeled the archive's energy, coaxing the unlit corners into a warm, golden light" restates rather than advances. Some strong images ("chess clock frozen at midnight") can't overcome the pervasive vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues: "The philosopher" opens 15+ sentences; "mechanical rainforest" appears 8 times without variation; "hum of insight" repeats 6 times identically. Template cadence runs throughout: "The philosopher felt...", "The philosopher had...", "As he walked/journeyed/listened..." Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs 5-7 restate consciousness expansion without advancement. Information density is low with multiple sentences doing single jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops severely damage momentum: "challenges that lay ahead"/"trials to come"/"challenges that lay ahead" repeat the same concept. Stock mystical phrasing ("otherworldly energy," "expectant hush," "inner light") and filter-heavy constructions ("travelers felt," "seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy throughout, particularly damaging the closure's potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "The bellhop" appears 19 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts (silence as burden/price paid/choice made). Abstract telling dominates over concrete scene work: "nerve regeneration was a slow process" repeated without dramatization. These artifacts pervade the piece, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.1)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the text: "cryptic messages"/"mysterious annotations"/"trail of subtle hints" repeat the same concept. Template cadence runs throughout ("Kael's eyes...scanned," "Kael worked tirelessly," "Kael's presence became"). Abstract phrasing dominates peak moments ("gentle rebuke," "subtle unmasking") avoiding concrete imagery. Filter-heavy construction dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "Maya's thoughts" variations appear multiple times, "began to" constructions proliferate, and abstract declarations ("periodically eternal," "drifting moored") obscure meaning. Template cadence runs ("As she...Maya..." structure) and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about hidden secrets) reduce momentum. The writing is serviceable but lacks the precision needed for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "stargazer" appears 12 times, creating mechanical cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops exist ("weight of her own insignificance"/"lost in the silence," "reignite the spark"/"rediscover the purpose"). Abstract phrases like "thunderous serenity" and "awkwardly confident" substitute for concrete description throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("As she walked...As she rounded...As the last symbol...As the reconstruction") creates mechanical rhythm. Abstract phrasing dominates peak moments: "implanted destiny unfolding within her, like a lotus blooming in the sun." Multiple paraphrase loops restate without advancing, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythms generally support the meditative pace, with varied sentence lengths creating breathing room. However, repetitive structures appear ("She had...", "As she...") and some phrases loop conceptually (trees reaching out described twice with similar language), while abstract terminology occasionally dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition undermines momentum: "forgotten library" appears 6 times, "luminescent ache" 4 times, "necessary darkness" 3 times, creating paraphrase loops across paragraphs. Template cadence pervades with "The [noun]..., [verb]" structures. Abstract modifiers ("otherworldly," "ethereal," "unseen") substitute for concrete detail. Information density suffers as multiple paragraphs restate the transformation without advancing new knowledge—particularly the final third which cycles through established concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.3)
    Repetitive sentence structures ("Kael's eyes...," "As Kael...," "Kael...") create monotony. Abstract phrases like "sea of uncertainty" and "fire of curiosity and discovery" lack concrete specificity. Multiple paraphrase loops exist: "ephemeral patterns"/"patterns that had already begun to fade." Template cadence pervades.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("fragile peace," "subversive activity," "contraband truths") without concrete specificity. Template cadence appears throughout ("As she worked," "As the snow continued," "As Aria returned") and the prose tends toward telling over showing, particularly in emotional beats ("felt a sense of pride and trepidation").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition and loops pervade the text: "tranquil/tranquility" appears 8 times, "gentle" 7 times, "peace/peaceful" 9 times, creating synonym churn rather than development. Template constructions like "As she [verb]" appear repeatedly. The final six paragraphs essentially restate Aria's contentment without adding new information, violating the paragraph cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "The fisher" or "As she," creating template cadence. Key moments rely on abstract telling ("her spirit renewed, her connection...deepened") rather than concrete imagery. The phrase "patterns break themselves" appears twice without clarification, and several passages loop similar content about the garden's whispers and the goddess's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "Adelaide" appears 19 times, creating numbing cadence. Template structures dominate ("As she...", "With each..."). Paraphrase loops abound: "uncover the truth"/"uncover hidden truths"/"uncovering the truth." Mixed metaphors (webs of logic, orbits of regret) clash without purpose. Information density remains low with multiple sentences restating identical content.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction weakens line-level craft: "the dissonance of old guilt," "fabric of reality grow thin," "meteor hush descend." Template phrasing appears throughout ("As she worked," "As the hours passed," "As the night wore on"). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, with mixed metaphors like tattoos "absorbing" fears while being "constellation patterns."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.3)
    Extensive paraphrase loops undermine momentum: "The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world, a world that was slowly coming into focus" appears nearly verbatim twice. Template cadence ("She was...", "It was...", "As she...") and abstract labels ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "rename this place, to reclaim it" / "The act of renaming was not simply...it was an attempt to redefine" restates without advancing. Abstract phrasing like "infuse it with a new sense of purpose" and "transformative power of aberrant mercy" replaces concrete action. Template cadence appears in "As she [verb]" constructions repeated across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues pervade the text: "Echo felt" appears 8 times, "began to" 4 times, creating template cadence. Abstract descriptors ("ethereal," "otherworldly," "mystical") substitute for concrete detail. The story contains multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around Echo's memories and the garden's transformation. Information density remains low with many sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "Luna's thoughts were a jumble of colors and textures" followed immediately by redundant description of being "guided by somatic markers." Template phrasing appears throughout ("Luna felt," "Luna began," "Luna's journey"). The prose relies on abstract assertions ("newfound clarity," "otherworldly glow") rather than concrete imagery, with multiple instances of telling what should be shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "Aria felt herself float" appears twice, multiple instances of "the unknown," redundant descriptions of the fossil and heat-mapping process. Template phrases like "she was driven by" and "she knew that" create mechanical cadence. The writing tells emotional states ("exhilarating and unsettling") rather than embodying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition loops dominate: "shared wisdom" appears 5 times, "turner" 19 times, variations of "catalog/button" cycle endlessly. Template cadence pervades: "The turner's [abstract noun] was [philosophical claim]" repeats throughout. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops—lines 19-23 restate the same "prophecy into possibility" concept without advancement. Abstract diction ("transmuting," "crucible," "alchemy") replaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive repetition plagues the prose: "mist swirled/swirling" appears 5 times, "The spy felt" recurs mechanically, "sense that/sense of" creates loops.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "gloom-hill coachman," "palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity." Template cadence appears in "The coachman..." repetitions (8 instances). Paraphrase loops occur: "fog-bound"/"mist-shrouded," multiple variations on stillness/serenity. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity (needle as "umbilical cord").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.4)
    Repetitive sentence structures ("As she...", "The sound was...", "In this...") create monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts—the glass "holding secrets" appears in variations four times. The phrase "newfound understanding" and its synonyms repeat without adding pressure.

The prose loops conceptually, restating the same ideas about memory, preservation, and moving forward without advancing pressure or revealing new information.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    Severe redundancy issues plague the prose: "keeper of secrets" appears twice verbatim; multiple paraphrase loops restate Lena's search for connection; template cadence runs ("As she... Lena..." repeated four times). The final third especially suffers from abstract summary—"The memory of the day's events would stay with her" adds no pressure or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "Lyra felt," "Lyra realized," "Lyra knew" create mechanical rhythm; the final seven paragraphs begin with near-identical constructions ("As the...", "The...", "With..."). Multiple instances of synonym churn ("cosmic tricksters" repeated 6 times) and abstract padding ("sense of possibility," "sense of gratitude," "sense of pride"). The prose lacks information density, with most sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several strong images but marred by repetitive phrasing ("Lyra felt" appears 7 times) and abstract inflation in peak moments ("vast, star-filled expanse," "limitless possibility"). The phrase "prudently adventurous" feels forced, and multiple sentences begin with "As" creating template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition issues throughout: "mist swirled" variants appear multiple times, "sense of" constructions proliferate, and abstract phrases like "subtleties of expression" and "essence of his quest" drain specificity. The final third particularly suffers from template phrasing ("As they parted ways," "With a sense of purpose") and conceptual loops about empathy and understanding.

    Severe repetition issues throughout: "nervously confident" appears 4 times, "coded stanzas" 5 times, "reversible exile" 6 times. Template phrasing dominates ("As she...Emilia" starts 5 paragraphs).

Abstract placeholder language ("beacon of luminous disbelief," "sculpt possibility from ashes") substitutes for concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "dusky harmony" appears three times; "polished calm" and "perceptively calm" repeat without variation; the abandoned train's significance is restated rather than deepened. Template cadence emerges in "As he..." constructions (five instances). The prose achieves clarity but lacks the compression and density needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "shared burdens" appears 5 times, "midnight solace" 3 times, variations of "understanding" 6 times, creating synonym loops rather than progression. Template cadence pervades ("As she [verb], [outcome]" structure repeats). The prose tells through abstract assertions ("weight of her task slowly lifting") rather than showing through concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "hidden patterns"/"hidden pathways"/"hidden networks" cycle without advancement. Template mystical phrases ("otherworldly light," "veil between worlds," "fabric of reality") substitute for specific imagery. The prose achieves atmosphere but lacks propulsion—many sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the overwrought final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "searching for solace" followed immediately by "drawn to this forsaken place" restates without advancing; "trees seemed to loom...branches like skeletal fingers" then "trees seemed to lean in" recycles the personification. Template phrases like "sense of peace," "weight lifting," and "feeling whole" in the resolution lack specificity. The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices propulsion to repetitive description.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition plagues the prose: "Jack felt" appears constantly, "sense of" constructions proliferate, and the final ten paragraphs loop through variations of the same abstract resolution. Template cadence ("The [noun] was [adjective]") dominates. Lines like "The world was full of possibilities" and "celestial map guiding him" are stock phrases without specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "reestablish" appears 11 times, "connection" 8 times, creating deadening loops. Abstract phrases like "threads of energy and influence" and "physics of transition" substitute for concrete imagery, while template constructions ("As she [verb], Elara [verb]") create mechanical rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and synonym loops ("flowing and ebbing," "gentle, relentless passage of time" repeated) drain momentum. Template phrases like "testament to," "blend of," and "reflection of" create scaffold rather than advancing story. The final paragraph merely restates earlier abstractions without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy overwriting throughout with abstract language ("otherworldly silence," "ethereal light," "inexplicable connection") that obscures concrete action. Template cadence runs appear ("Aria felt...," "She saw...," "She knew...") and the text loops the concept of "latent radiance" without advancing meaning. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity (pearl as "vessel," "key," requiring to be "crowned").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "seeking became a form of self-forgiveness" followed immediately by "the act of seeking was, in itself, a form of finding." Template cadence appears in "As she..." constructions (5 instances) and repetitive "reminder" phrasing (4 instances), creating mechanical rhythm that undermines the lyrical intent.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive abstract language ("ethereal glow," "cautious exuberance," "electric sense of anticipation") and template mystical phrasing weaken line-level craft. Multiple filter constructions ("seemed to," "began to," "felt themselves becoming") distance us from immediacy. Repetitive sentence openings ("The dreamer...," "As they...") create monotonous rhythm. The prose tells emotional states rather than embodying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant overwriting with mixed metaphors ("mulberry ache," "threads of fate") and repetitive abstract phrasing. Multiple paraphrase loops ("determined to unravel"/"slowly beginning to unravel"). Template cadence in "Elian's thoughts" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe repetition issues throughout: "Aria's hands," "Aria's mind," "Aria's fingers," "Aria felt" create template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "profound silence"/"stillness"/"quiet" cycle without progression. Abstract telling dominates ("sense of wonder," "sense of awe," "deep sense of connection") where concrete imagery should anchor emotion. The phrase "threshold of stillness" appears five times without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition problems dominate: "Aria" appears 27 times, "grotto" 13 times, "cycle of rebirth" 7 times, creating deadening loops. Template constructions proliferate: "As she [verb], Aria [verb]" appears in multiple variants. Abstract telling replaces concrete scene throughout: "deep understanding," "inexplicable connection," "sense of peace."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and paraphrase loops damage momentum—"cloak of doubt" repeats without evolution, multiple sentences restate the importance of nuance, and the conscience's "sincerely insincere" nature gets explained rather than shown. Template phrasing like "As they [verb]" appears repeatedly. The prose privileges abstract philosophizing over concrete action, creating density without propulsion.

    Extensive repetition weakens momentum: "sycamore hush" appears 4 times, "patterns" 6 times, multiple paraphrase loops about understanding dawning. Template cadence runs ("The researcher... The student... The grotto..."). Abstract phrasing ("profound understanding," "otherworldly energy") replaces specific imagery in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe repetition and loops throughout: "continued to" appears 7 times, "harmonic" 5 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("The skimmer remained"/"the skimmer sat"/"the skimmer remained steadfast"). Template cadence dominates with "The skimmer's [X]" and "As the [Y]" constructions. Abstract language ("vibrational hum," "unhurried intensity," "multisensory awareness") replaces concrete detail. Information density is extremely low—most paragraphs restate the same concept of patient observation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition mars the prose: "lingering luminance" appears 5 times, "Eira knew/felt" constructions proliferate, and the final seven paragraphs begin with nearly identical "As she/Eira/The spire/With" patterns. Template cadence ("Eira felt... Eira knew... Eira realized") dulls momentum. The phrase "brilliant dimness" tries for paradox but reads as confusion rather than purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("flickering light cast eerie shadows," "sea of twinkling lights...like a celestial map") but suffers from abstract padding and repetitive structures. Multiple sentences begin with "Kael" + verb construction, and phrases like "overwhelming sense of purpose" and "almost palpable energy" provide no concrete detail. The paraphrase loop between "he knew that he was on the cusp of a great discovery" and similar revelatory statements dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=2.8)
    Pervasive repetition loops plague the text: "decision maker" appears 31 times, multiple paragraphs restate fulfilled purpose without advancement. Template cadence runs throughout ("The decision maker [verb]...The decision maker [verb]"). Abstract padding like "vast and mysterious universe" and "sense of connection to the cosmos" replaces concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy pervade the text: "echo of sacrifice" appears four times with minimal variation; multiple sentences restate the reaper's connection to the past without advancing meaning. Template cadence runs through "The reaper [verb]" constructions. Lines 17-20 essentially repeat the same content about sacrifice and understanding three times. The prose achieves atmosphere but at the cost of momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive abstraction and repetitive stems plague the prose: "The mage's..." appears 7 times, creating template cadence. Abstract phrases like "plausible impossibility" and "brittle devotion" substitute for concrete imagery. Multiple paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the bell's transformation. The final third especially suffers from telling rather than showing ("monument to the power of rebuilding").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "The warden" appears 19 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts (photographs leading to memory, spinning stories for healing). The phrase "precisely humane" is forced twice without clear meaning. Information density is low with excessive scaffolding about abstract purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "a touch of wonder"/"sense of wonder," repeated "sense of" constructions, and the threshold/verge/edge progression that restates without advancing. Template cadence appears in "Elara [verb]" patterns. The prose achieves clarity but lacks density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.1)
    Extensive repetition plagues the prose: "watcher's burden" appears three times, "midnight pattern seeker" twice, multiple paraphrase loops about revising and working. Template phrases like "her eyes scanning," "her mind racing," and "knowing that" create mechanical rhythm. The text loops the same concepts without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive abstraction and repetitive phrasing dominate: "sense of" appears 11 times, creating template cadence. Key passages loop the same concept: "vivify his true self" / "vivify his true nature" and multiple variations of finding/being himself. The closure paragraph contains three near-identical assertions of being "fully alive" without concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and redundancy plague the prose: "pondering/contemplating," "mystery/enigma," "theories/ideas/scenarios" cycle without advancing meaning. Template phrases like "sense of [abstract noun]" appear five times. The prose suffers from abstract telling ("felt a sense of purpose," "heart filled with anticipation") rather than concrete showing, and multiple paragraphs could be cut without losing information or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive phrasing plagues the text ("the household," "echo chamber tunnel," "mournfully eager" variants appear multiple times). The final third dissolves into summary loops that restate the same ideas about memory and healing. Template cadence appears in constructions like "The maestro's legacy lived on" followed by similar abstract assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "mist swirled"/"mist seemed to thicken"/"mist began to clear" repeats without progression, and "foggy lucidity"/"veil of sleep" restates the same dreamlike state. Template phrasing appears in "As she walked"/"As she waited" constructions, though the atmospheric language occasionally achieves genuine texture.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive overwriting with mixed metaphors ("frozen bloom of twilight"), abstract phrasing ("vivify the essence"), and template cadence ("The alchemist's...," "The air...," "The moment..."). Multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around destiny/fate concepts. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("mixture of disdain and fascination") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive sentence openings ("As she...", "Aria...", "She...") create template cadence across multiple paragraphs. Abstract phrasing like "serenely electric atmosphere" and "fantasy practicality" lacks concrete specificity. Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar content about discovery and connection without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract declarations ("ready to merge parallel timelines," "forge a new path," "adventure of a lifetime") and synonym churn around transformation concepts. Template cadence appears in the final section with multiple "Elara felt/knew/stood" constructions. The writing tells emotional states ("excitement and trepidation") rather than embodying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues throughout: "sinew thread" appears 11 times, "patterns" variants 8 times, "rational enchantment" 4 times. Template cadence dominates ("The architect [verb]," "She [verb]") and abstract language ("texture of connection," "ever-shifting landscape") replaces concrete imagery, creating a loop-heavy, overwritten feel that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "benthic city" (4x), "somber marvel" (2x), "unfolded horizons" (3x), extensive paraphrase loops about expanding understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Aria stood," "Aria approached," "Aria felt," "Aria smiled") creates mechanical rhythm. Abstract descriptors like "otherworldly silence," "mystical realm," and "incidental heroism" replace concrete detail. Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "tears streaming"/"tears flowed harder," "mist swirling"/"mist closing in," "gentle hum"/"gentle hush." The filter-verb stack in peak moments ("Aria felt," "Aria realized," "Aria began") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]," "Lyra [verb]") creating template cadence throughout. Abstract telling dominates over concrete showing: "a testament to the passage of time," "her mind racing with the implications." The "crashing hush" oxymoron strains without earning its contradiction. Multiple filter verbs and summary statements reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract descriptors ("otherworldly light," "inexplicable urge") and repetitive constructions ("Akira felt," "Akira knew"). The paraphrase loop between "midnight solace" appearing three times without evolution triggers deduction, and elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns") clashes with minimal concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "The storyteller" opens numerous sentences, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear throughout ("The canyon's echoes responded, swelling in a crescendo" followed immediately by redundant description). The phrase "whispers of the ancients" and variations appear seven times without meaningful variation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "gravitationally playful nature," "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed" strain for effect without clarity. Template phrases proliferate: "Lena felt," "Lena knew," "As she [verb]" creating repetitive cadence. The phrase "missing return changed" appears without explanation, suggesting a copy error.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Luna's music was...", "The statues, now...", "As she...") and paraphrase loops weaken momentum. Abstract descriptors like "vibrating with renewed vitality" and "exuberant and tender" replace concrete imagery. The phrase "resonantly soft" appears three times without variation, suggesting synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "he had delivered the package...had perhaps taken a small step towards healing a broken promise" restates the same content. Template phrasing appears throughout ("As he...", "The mailman...", repetitive paragraph openings). Abstract philosophizing ("larger narrative of redemption," "beacon of hope") replaces concrete imagery in crucial moments, though basic clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues plague the text: "misting hush" appears 6 times, often in adjacent paragraphs; "The carpenter" starts 11 sentences; template cadence runs throughout ("The carpenter's hands...The carpenter's thoughts...The carpenter's quietly persistent..."). Paraphrase loops abound: "a new tale had begun, one of hope and beauty" immediately followed by similar abstraction. The final six paragraphs loop the same "transformation through silence" idea without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition loops undermine momentum: "steadfast and alone" appears twice, multiple variations on "analog memories," and the scarf's "otherworldly light/glow" recycled without evolution. Template cadence pervades ("As she worked," "As the hours passed," "As the light"). The prose favors abstract descriptors over concrete imagery, with phrases like "profound beauty" and "gentle hum" providing minimal sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("shadowed nexus," "hush of cosmic possibility," "withered fingers"). Abstract phrases like "enveloped secrets" and "improbable longing" lack concrete grounding. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("The locksmith's eyes...," "The locksmith's gaze...," "The locksmith's task..."). Information density suffers from atmospheric padding over precise action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive redundancy and scaffold sentences weaken momentum: "Emilia felt a sense of trepidation" followed immediately by "The uncertainty was almost palpable" creates paraphrase loops. Template cadence appears in runs like "She knew that..." repeated across multiple paragraphs. The prose favors abstract telling ("sense of crisp nostalgia") over concrete imagery, and the repetitive sentence structures create monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "hush of the library" appears three times, multiple variations on discovering/unlocking/uncovering secrets create paraphrase loops, and template constructions like "The archivist's [noun]" open too many paragraphs. The prose reaches for elevated diction ("topography of the soul," "geometry of being") that feels overwrought rather than earned through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe overwriting pervades every paragraph with purple prose ("hush of budding hope," "fabric of reality," "threshold of infinite possibilities"). Template fantasy phrases and synonym loops abound ("vibrant colors"/"riot of color"/"color of wonder" repeated). The prose prioritizes ornamental description over momentum, with multiple paraphrase loops restating the same mystical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "interlaced hush" (5x), "accumulated silence" (4x), "tapestry needle" (5x), "restless spirits" (4x). Template stems proliferate: "As she [verb]" appears repeatedly. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops about silence, purpose, and craft without advancing new information.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose flows competently but suffers from abstract telling and repetitive structure. Phrases like "she felt" appear 8 times, creating filter-verb accumulation. Lines like "mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of the known" and "secrets waiting to be uncovered" paraphrase the same concept. The writing lacks information density, with many sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from abstract philosophizing and emotional telling: "I felt a melancholy settle over me, a sophisticated sorrow." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the letting go theme restated in various forms. Lines like "The journey had been long, but the insight was worth the cost" assert rather than dramatize. Template phrasing appears in "As I [verb]" constructions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive template cadence ("As she...," "The balladeer...," repetitive paragraph openings) creates monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content (ghost responding through messages, articulating the unspoken). Dense figurative language in every sentence without payoff obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive sentence openings ("Elara's," "She," "The") create monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "love that had flourished"/"love that had been shared," "icebound spire"/"frozen world." Template cadence pervades without purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition and scaffolding throughout: "Lyra's thoughts," "Lyra felt," "Lyra's eyes" create filter-verb stacks. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, such as the redundant explanations of "spooled wholeness." Template cadence runs ("She had...", "She remembered...", "She raised...") dull momentum. The phrase "dusty starlight" appears twice as a label without embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked modifiers: "small, unassuming book safe," "single, worn coin," "subtle, intricate beauty." Template cadence appears in "The artist..." constructions repeated across paragraphs. Abstract phrasing like "testament to," "victim of," "essence of" creates distance. The prose prioritizes elevated diction over momentum, with multiple instances of "seemed to" hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Eli began," "Eli's," "As Eli") and some scaffold phrasing. Phrases like "the look of someone on the verge of a great discovery" tell rather than show. The recurring "scratch of their pen" creates rhythm, but several paragraphs could be compressed without losing information, particularly the crew's return sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing: "rhythm of repair" appears three times, "intricate dance" twice, multiple instances of "seemed to" hedge descriptions. Template constructions like "It was here...that Kael" and "As Kael...a particular text" create scaffold. The filter-heavy construction "Kael felt a sense of peace settle over them" exemplifies the tendency toward telling emotional states rather than embodying them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.3)
    Prose suffers from extensive telling over showing, with abstract declarations replacing concrete action: "settlers felt a deep sense of connection" rather than embodied experience. Repetitive structure creates monotony ("As the settlers...," "The settlers..."). Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar content about community and transformation without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive overwriting with abstract metaphors ("pane of hush," "time's final ripple") that obscure rather than clarify, plus repetitive stems and filter constructions. The phrase "seemed to" creates distance and uncertainty where concrete observation would serve better, and paraphrase loops abound (the hush is described similarly across multiple paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose suffers from template cadence ("She picked it up... She made her way... She was offhandedly exact") and repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Figurative language appears sparingly but includes clichés ("weight settling heavy on her shoulders"). Information density is low with several sentences merely advancing position without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "grief still lingered"/"loosened grief"/"loosened its tight grip"; "transform"/"transformation"/"transformed" appears seven times; "connection"/"connected"/"connections" cycles throughout. Template cadence dominates ("As she..." opens multiple paragraphs). The prose tells emotional states through labels ("peace," "gratitude," "purpose") rather than concrete embodiment. Filter-verb stacks appear in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "sense of" appears 8 times, "seemed" 6 times, "felt" 11 times creating filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose demonstrates competent clarity but suffers from repetitive abstract declarations: "sense of resolution," "sense of peace," "symbol of resilience." Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("The memories would always be there, but they would no longer be a source of pain" restates the smoothing concept). Filter constructions ("Elara felt," "she knew") distance immediacy in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with phrases like "hush of borrowed starlight" and "diamonds scattered across velvet expanse" that prioritize prettiness over precision. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the bridging/unity theme repeated in variations. The text relies on abstract telling ("empathetically decisive nature," "sense of timelessness") rather than concrete showing, though basic grammar and structure remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe repetition issues: "As Elara/she worked" appears multiple times, "abandoned dreams" repeats five times, "entangled memories" four times. Abstract language dominates ("inexplicable connection," "otherworldly energy," "labyrinthine corridors") without concrete imagery. Template cadence runs throughout with "Elara [verb]" structures. The final paragraph abandons scene for pure summary.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues: "seeds of vigilance" appears 6 times, "latent blaze" 3 times without evolution. Template phrases proliferate: "she knew," "she felt," "she realized." The prose tells emotional states ("intense urge," "newfound purpose") rather than embodying them through concrete action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "the sculptor" appears 28 times, creating monotonous cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("bringing empathy into motion" / "empathy in motion"). Template structures like "The sculptor's [noun] [verb]" repeat mechanically. The final third contains multiple assertions without dramatization ("forever changed," "quiet heartbeat").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe paraphrase loops plague the text: "magnetic nexus" appears 5 times unchanged, "thoughtfully precise" twice, multiple restatements of seeking truth/beauty. Template cadence runs ("The world was...", "The tutor...", "As he...") create monotonous rhythm. Information density is extremely low - most paragraphs could be removed without changing knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "the very essence," "the very pages themselves," "the very stars," "the very fabric of reality." Abstract padding dilutes momentum: "varieties of silence," "complexities of empathy," "threads of connection." The phrase "eclectic pacifist" appears without demonstration. Template phrasing like "In this moment" repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("sense of," "felt a," appears 8+ times) and abstract emotional labeling replaces concrete sensation. Template cadence runs through multiple "As she..." constructions, and the phrase "undercurrent of wisdom" repeats without variation, creating conceptual loops rather than deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("As she flew," "Lyra noticed," "She had") and abstract emotional labeling ("sense of wonder and awe," "sense of pride and accomplishment"). The "whirling silence" oxymoron works, but phrases like "leaving behind a trail of accelerated growth and possibility" feel overwritten without earning their elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences: "rapidly adapting" appears three times; "complex interplay" twice; multiple variations of "she was determined/driven."

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe redundancy issues plague the prose: "sculpted hush" appears 8 times, often in adjacent paragraphs without evolving meaning. Template phrases like "Elian sought to," "Elian aimed to," "Elian's motivation was" create mechanical cadence. The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating Elian's peace and purpose without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose shows competent control with varied sentence lengths and some evocative phrases ("Thunder-echo range," "canyon hush"). However, multiple issues accumulate: the non-standard "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice, abstract language dominates concrete action ("weave between worlds," "unseen realms"), and repetitive stems appear throughout ("She had," "As she"). The mystical journey section particularly suffers from vague abstractions rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with purple constructions like "kaleidoscope of emotions that seemed to shift and writhe like a living thing" and repetitive abstract descriptions of Echo's work. Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("driven by a singular motivation" followed immediately by restatement). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, creating opacity around key story mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues throughout: "fade from memory to myth" appears verbatim twice, extensive paraphrase loops about connection and wonder, and template cadence in "She knew...She had always been...As she walked." The phrase "germinating a sense of connection" and its variants create synonym churn. Abstract descriptors ("quiet purpose," "ethereal glow") replace concrete detail. Multiple filter constructions ("Eira felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and synonym loops drain momentum: "profound truth"/"hidden connections"/"underlying truth" cycle without advancing meaning. Template cadence appears in "As she stood there"/"In this state"/"And as she stood there" creating repetitive structural patterns. The piece tells about pivotal beats ("felt herself becoming one with the world") rather than showing through concrete action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues plague the text: "forgotten orchard" appears 5 times, "bamboo forest" 5 times, "tree sap amber bead" 5 times verbatim.

    Severe repetition issues: "transformation" appears 7 times, multiple paraphrase loops ("forge something new, something that would defy"/"something beautiful"/"something truly remarkable"). Template phrasing pervades ("As I [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs). The prose tells about crafting without showing the actual forging process beyond generic "hammering" and "glowing metal."

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive repetition and scaffolding throughout: "the map maker" appears 19 times, creating mechanical cadence. Abstract phrases like "ever-changing topography" and "kaleidoscope of images and sensations" substitute for specific detail. The prose relies on telling over showing, particularly in the crucial revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears too frequently ("luminescent ache" repeated 4 times) and some passages loop conceptually ("sense of safety...feeling of safety"). Template phrases like "pang of recognition" and "sense of resolve form within him" lack specificity. However, key images land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive repetition loops drain momentum: "steer the dawn" appears 7 times, "glass lantern" 9 times, "emerald lighthouse" 8 times without variation or progression.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive repetition and loops weaken momentum: "The worker's" appears 16 times, often starting consecutive sentences. Template cadence pervades ("The worker...The trees...The moon"). Final third dissolves into abstract philosophizing with paraphrase loops ("journey into the heart of the labyrinth...journey of discovery and healing"). Mixed metaphors (weaving threads/mapping dreams) lack coherent vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition plague: "memory keeper" appears 17 times, "realm" 13 times, "woven dawns" 5 times without variation. Template cadence dominates ("She stopped...She stood...She knew...She smiled"). Paraphrase loops abound: "the realm began to flourish, its magic rekindled" restates what was just shown.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence pervades with "As [time marker], Elys [verb]" structures appearing in at least eight paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "sense of peace that lingered there" repeats the earlier "tranquility that lingered." Template phrases like "As she..." begin multiple paragraphs. The final paragraph contains explicit theme summary that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and repetitive phrasing weaken line-level craft: "seemed to" appears 6 times, creating hedging; conceptual loops like "beauty that emerged"/"abiding beauty"/"piece of that beauty" dilute impact. Template constructions ("As she worked," "With each") and abstract descriptors ("profound revelation," "deep motivation") replace specific action. The prose achieves atmosphere but lacks propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "comforting unease/familiar feeling," "fragile peace/truce of hush," and the tension being described three different ways in quick succession. Abstract descriptors like "practiced air" and "knowing glint" replace specific detail. The final two paragraphs loop through variations of accomplishment and memory without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: abstract compounds ("terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia"), repetitive mystical descriptors, and vague emotional declarations ("sense of wonder and trepidation"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Aria's seeking/understanding, and the text relies on telling emotional states rather than embodying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("inescapable calling" appears three times), abstract telling ("felt the weight of her suppressed creativity begin to lift"), and mechanical metaphors (uncorking a sealed bottle).

The final two paragraphs loop the same content about returning to the cave and uncovering secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Aria was intrigued," "Aria was driven," "Aria felt," "Aria spent hours") creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops restate concepts: the map's secrets are mentioned redundantly across paragraphs 7-8-10-12. The phrase "candor in small moments" appears verbatim twice, violating economy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetition problems undermine readability: entire concepts and phrases loop throughout (28 paragraphs for ~650 words creates visual monotony). Template cadence pervades: "As [X], [Y]" appears constantly. The prose is overwritten with abstract mystical language ("muted vigor," "seasonally mute inhabitants") that obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "inner static" (5x), "fragmented wholeness" (5x), "desert rose(s)" (11x), plus template cadence in "Aria [verb], Aria [verb]" constructions. The paraphrase loop between "a sense of fragmented wholeness that she had not experienced" and "her own sense of wholeness" exemplifies the redundancy throughout. These artifacts touch the closure beat, creating significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive template constructions dominate: "Emilia [verb]" appears in most paragraphs, creating mechanical rhythm. Abstract telling replaces concrete showing ("story was now intertwined," "role had been cemented"). Clichéd phrases proliferate: "first light of dawn crept," "sense of calm wash over her," "haven of peace." The prose achieves basic clarity but lacks density or propulsion, reading like summarized events rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling undermine line-level craft: "quiet purpose," "mysterious familiarity," "sense of kinship." Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same ideas (liberation/escape, encoding/coded messages). Template openings ("As she worked," "As she danced," "As she watched") and filter-heavy construction dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structure and clear spatial choreography through the tunnels. However, multiple instances of telling over showing ("betrayed a sense of distraction," "serene quality") and abstract phrasing ("tangible connection to memories long forgotten") reduce immediacy. The final three paragraphs loop through variations of "mysteries still hidden" without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    Severe repetition problems: "tranquil/tranquility" appears 7 times, "smooth/smoothed/smoothing the hush" 6 times, "terrestrially cosmic" 3 times without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence dominates ("The summoner [verb]," "As the [noun]"). Abstract descriptors ("profound connection," "deep satisfaction") replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and redundant phrasing pervade: "secrets of the past"/"secrets they hold"/"secrets that lie hidden" appears five times; the concept of hidden/uncovered repeats seven times without variation. Template cadence runs ("The student... The tutor... As they...") and filter-verb stacks in peak moments dull immediacy. The final third especially suffers from repetitive abstract assertions about mystery and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues pervade: "whispering seashell half" appears 7 times, "velvet garden" 5 times, extensive paraphrase loops ("The seashell's whispers were a call to reclaim her past, to confront the memories she had suppressed"). Template cadence runs throughout ("Lyra felt...," "Lyra knew...," "Lyra's..."). The final third consists almost entirely of abstract summary statements that could be cut without losing story information.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition loops pervade: "marble sanctuary" appears 5 times, "heritage rose thorn" 5 times, "wisely enduring" twice verbatim, multiple "As she [verb]" openings. Template cadence runs throughout ("The forger's task was...," "The text was...," "The forger smiled..."). Abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "soft gentle light") replace concrete specificity. Information density remains low with extensive paraphrase loops—the final seven paragraphs essentially restate completion and satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and repetitive phrasing weaken line-level craft: "seemed to" appears 7 times, filter constructions like "Aria felt" and "she saw" distance us from immediacy. Template cadence runs like "As she sang... As the night wore on... As she sang on..." create mechanical rhythm. The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("intricate patterns," "hidden truths") over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Aria sat... She weaves... Aria's eyes were... She was searching...") creates mechanical rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "windows of connection" / "invisible threads that bound the world together" / "network of connections." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with many sentences that could be removed without changing knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition dulls momentum: "hidden patterns" appears five times, "whispering parapet" twice, multiple variations on understanding/truth/revelation. Template phrasing pervades: "She felt...", "As she..." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes rather than trusting the image. Filter verbs and abstract descriptors dominate over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("She had been," "She followed," "She was," "As she") and filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("determined to get to the bottom" followed by "curiosity was piqued...more determined than ever"). The writing is functional but lacks density or propulsion, with scaffolding phrases like "it seemed" appearing four times.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing: "As she stood there," "As the days passed," "Years later" create mechanical transitions. Paraphrase loops abound: "shape a new dawn"/"shaping a new dawn"/"new dawn broke"/"new dawn would be born." Information density is extremely low—entire paragraphs convey single abstract ideas without concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "lonesome splendor" appears twice, "vagrant penny poet" twice, multiple variations on preservation/memory theme without advancement. Template cadence runs appear ("The poet's eyes...," "The poet's thoughts...," "The poet's pen..."). The prose achieves moments of clarity but loops drain propulsion, particularly the redundant final paragraphs about purpose and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant repetition issues: "ethereal" appears 4 times, "resonance/resonate" 6 times, "artifact" 11 times without variation. Template phrasing pervades: "Azure Coat felt," "seemed to," "a sensation that." The prose achieves atmospheric density but relies on abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "ethereal quality") rather than concrete imagery. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive repetition and loops drain momentum: "The mapper knew" appears 7 times, "moment" 6 times, redundant phrases like "soft crunch of snow beneath her feet"/"footsteps quiet on the snow-covered ground." Template cadence runs throughout ("The mapper knew... She had spent... As she stood..."). Abstract padding ("moment of great significance," "deep-seated motivation") replaces concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling undermines line-level craft: "memories that had been entangled in her mind began to untangle" exemplifies the pattern of stating transformation without showing it. Template phrases like "Maya felt," "Maya knew," "Maya's thoughts" create filter-verb stacks. The prose relies on abstract declaration ("liberation," "freedom," "peace") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "vibrant hush" appears four times, extensive paraphrase loops ("seeking solace and a second opinion"/"seeking a way to turn his apology into action"), and template cadence in "The chaplain's eyes...The chaplain listened...The chaplain felt." The phrase "deserve a second chance" repeats mechanically. These artifacts significantly dull momentum and violate the loop/scaffold screen.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition plagues the prose: "steadily curious" appears 4 times, "irreverent awe" 5 times, "yearning algorithm" 7 times, "gears-and-cogs" 6 times. Template cadence dominates ("As she...," "With each...," "Throughout..."). Paragraphs 26-35 loop the same concepts without advancement. These artifacts pervade the closure section.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.6)
    Extensive paraphrase loops damage momentum: "searching for the truth"/"searching for a way to fill the void," "journey"/"quest," "transformed"/"new light"/"new truth"/"new purpose." Template cadence pervades ("She had been...," "She became...," "She was no longer..."). Abstract descriptors ("darker corners," "burning need," "fierce determination") replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "weighted breath before reply" appears three times; "calmly intuitive nature" and similar constructions repeat; "reconstitute the crystal" cycles through variations. The prose achieves moments of beauty ("ice floes below seemed to slow their restless motion") but sacrifices propulsion for atmospheric repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "sound of approaching endings" appears 4 times, "windborne solace" 3 times, multiple variations of "fragile" and "precious." Template cadence runs ("I felt...I felt...I felt") and abstract phrasing ("sense of detachment," "sense of peace") create loops that dull the prose impact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition problems: "destined mismatches" appears 6 times, "passionate subtlety" 3 times, extensive paraphrase loops (paragraphs 12-14 restate the same realization). Template cadence dominates with "The sentinel [verb]" or "She [verb]" openings. Lines 15-25 loop the same contentment without advancement. These artifacts pervade the final third, dulling any potential closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "echo of wisdom" (7x), "murmuring pavilion" (5x), "whisperfield calm" (3x), "conjured clearing" (5x) create loops without accumulation. Template cadence dominates: "The line walker [verb]" opens numerous sentences. Abstract language ("essence of wisdom," "subtle energies") replaces concrete imagery. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops restating the same preservation idea.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition loops pervade: "sense of peace/tranquility" recurs five times, "collective healing" four times, "dove gray map case" three times without evolution. Template cadence ("As she walked," "As she stood," "As she worked") and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about transformation and beauty) drain momentum. The vines climbing appears four times without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm in descriptive passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("suspended hush that seemed to reverberate," "weathered innocence seemed to stir") and the final two paragraphs contain repetitive phrasing about new beginnings. The crystal's "sonically reflective" property is mentioned twice without development.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition mars the prose: "The prophet" appears 20+ times; "fog" 12 times; multiple paragraphs begin identically ("The prophet's," "As she/the"). Paraphrase loops abound: "She knew that she had located what she was searching for" followed immediately by restatement. The final third especially suffers from redundant philosophical assertions about finding/feeling/carrying the sound, each restating without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing dominate: "luminous ache in his heart," "harness the ephemeral," "gateway to the infinite." Multiple paraphrase loops occur, particularly around Eli's realizations about the clock hand and universe. The prose relies on telling over showing, with key moments summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the text: "scent of hope" appears four times with identical meaning; "flawless goodbye" repeats without evolution. Template cadence runs throughout ("Lena began to...," "Emma's eyes...," "As she..."). Abstract phrases like "pulsing stillness" and "decisively kind" substitute for concrete action, while "reunifying with the world" remains conceptually vague.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues - "Lyra" appears 27 times creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops throughout (research/understanding/secrets recycled). Abstract telling dominates ("insatiable curiosity," "sense of wonder") without concrete embodiment. Information density extremely low with passages restating the same content.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition and scaffold plague the prose: "Emilia felt" appears 8 times, "sense of" 7 times, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "She realized that she had been given a rare gift - the chance to turn mistakes into constellations, to find beauty in the imperfections. The idea resonated deeply with her, and Emilia felt a sense of purpose begin to take shape." Abstract descriptors replace concrete detail throughout. Information density is extremely low with most paragraphs restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "star watcher" appears 29 times, creating mechanical cadence. Template constructions dominate ("The star watcher's eyes...gazed," "The star watcher's presence was...," "The star watcher's heart..."). Paraphrase loops abound - "pearl of stillness" concept is restated without advancement at least six times. The "zephyr bloom" phrase repeats without earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive abstraction and redundancy undermine momentum: "healing," "sanctuary," "peace," and "vulnerability" cycle without advancement. Template phrases proliferate: "Aria felt," "Aria knew," "she had come to." The final third contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same transformation without added pressure or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive abstraction and paraphrase loops weaken line-level momentum: "she felt a sense of calm wash over her" followed immediately by redundant emotional labeling. Template phrasing pervades ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized" appears 15+ times). The final third especially suffers from synonym churn around writing/words/story without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive template cadence ("As she worked," "As the morning wore on") and paraphrase loops weaken momentum. "Sense of connection and belonging" / "threads of community and connection" repeat the same abstract concepts. Overreliance on "seemed to" hedging (5+ instances) dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "stillness" appears five times with variations like "stillness so profound," "stillness was now moving," creating conceptual loops. Template phrasing pervades key moments ("As she worked," "As the last rays," "As the light faded"). The prose reaches for elevated diction ("morbid perfume," "otherworldly light") that often feels ornamental rather than precise, though individual sentences achieve clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition and scaffold sentences dilute momentum: "Elian" appears 19 times, often starting consecutive sentences. Paraphrase loops abound ("he felt a sense of satisfaction"/"felt a deep sense of connection"/"felt the weight of his discoveries"). The prose tells rather than shows, summarizing months of work in abstract terms without concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.1)
    Extensive repetition and synonym loops pervade the text: "shingled hush" appears four times, "bronze grotto" six times, variations of "weaver's craft/work" recur constantly. Template cadence dominates with "As she...", "The weaver...", "In the..." openings. The piece reads as extended paraphrase of its central concept without information density.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "rust-hued peace" appears twice verbatim, the concept of containing emotions is restated in lines 5, 12, and 21, and "here and gone" gets explained rather than dramatized. Template cadence appears in "As she began...As the kettle reached...As the afternoon wore on" creating mechanical progression that undermines organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "fractured stillness" appears four times, "testament to" three times, and multiple paragraphs restate the same concepts without advancement. Template cadence runs ("They had," "They moved," "They heard") and abstract phrasing ("palpable mist," "fierce determination") substitute for specific imagery. The prose tells about atmosphere rather than creating it through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The terminal, once a symbol of abandonment, was becoming a beacon of possibility" restates what's already shown). Template cadence runs ("As she...," "Maya's...," "The...") and abstract descriptors ("stoic wonder," "newfound sense of purpose") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetition problems permeate the text: "excruciatingly gentle" appears four times, "soundless sanctuary" three times, "petrichor nostalgia" three times, "crystal whispering forecourt" twice, "glacial hush" three times. Beyond keyword repetition, paraphrase loops abound: "newfound sense of purpose"/"deeper sense of purpose," multiple variations of making peace with abandoned dreams. Template cadence runs throughout with "Elian [verb]" and "As he [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing weakens line-level execution: "weight of history settle around her," "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," "tangled threads of her own motivations." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Lyra's realization (lines 13-18 restate the same self-discovery). Template phrases like "began to," "seemed to," and filter constructions ("Lyra felt," "Lyra realized") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive repetition and loops: "secrets" appears 7 times, "ancient methods" 3 times, "mysteries/mysterious" 5 times without accumulating meaning. Template phrasing dominates ("She felt a sense of," "She had always been," "She was content to"). The final paragraph restates earlier material without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting with stacked modifiers ("unsettling stillness," "melancholic shadows," "intimate connection") and repetitive abstract concepts ("lonesome splendor" appears three times). Template cadence emerges in "I felt... I hoped... I began..." constructions, and paraphrase loops appear throughout (the geography of healing concept restated without advancement).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from extensive emotional scaffolding and abstract labels that dull immediacy: "felt a pang of sorrow," "surge of excitement, mixed with a dash of fear," "swelled with emotion." Template cadence appears in repetitive "The prince [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop between "restore its beauty" and "reawaken that beauty" adds no pressure. Strong moments exist ("stalactites that pierced the cavernous ceiling like shards of stone") but figurative density in non-pattern-taught beats creates overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures, though several template patterns emerge: "Aria's thoughts were interrupted," "Aria's mind began to wander," "Aria's eyes fell upon" create repetitive possessive constructions. Abstract descriptors like "unyielding compassion" and "gracefully alert" recur without concrete embodiment. The piece relies heavily on "felt" constructions (felt a surge, felt a sense) rather than showing internal states through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("She was," "Aria's," "She," "As she") creating template cadence. Abstract descriptors like "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" substitute for concrete detail. Paraphrase loops appear: "forgotten fountains" concept repeats without variation; "trapped memories" and "lost memories" restate without adding pressure. Filter verb stacks ("Aria felt," "she knew," "Aria spotted") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition loops plague the text: "nebula garden" appears 9 times, "sentimentalist" 28 times, variations of "sharing light without fire" recur mechanically. Template cadence dominates with "The sentimentalist's [noun]" and "As they [verb]" patterns. The prose recycles the same abstract descriptors—"infinite," "eternal," "cosmic beauty"—without information density or propulsion, creating a static meditation rather than advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "feeling a sense of peace settle over her" appears twice with minor variation; "the shape of collective grief" repeats three times without evolution. The prose tends toward abstract summary ("turmoil within," "weight of her grief") rather than concrete image, and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive repetition and paraphrase loops drain momentum: "incremental absolution" appears 5 times, "pendulum bob" 6 times without evolving use. Template cadence dominates ("Elara felt...she knew...she believed"). Abstract emotional summaries ("surge of determination," "sense of peace") replace concrete embodiment throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstraction and repetitive phrasing—"uncharted echoes" appears five times without variation. Template constructions proliferate: "The gardener's [noun] [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Key moments rely on telling ("excitement and trepidation," "newfound understanding") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition loops weaken momentum: "the cartographer" appears 16 times, often starting consecutive sentences; "the pen" and variations of "future/possibility" create redundant cycles. Phrases like "the landscape of possibility began to shift" and "realm of possibilities" restate without advancing. The prose reaches for profundity through abstraction rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "mist-shrouded alcove" variants, "thistled calm," "ember alcove," and multiple instances of "dust motes dancing." Template cadence pervades: "As she [verb], [result]" structure repeats throughout. The prose tells about atmosphere rather than creating it through varied syntax and rhythm. Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition and loops severely damage momentum: "somber" appears 4 times, "fleeting" 4 times, "mirage of safety" 5 times. Template cadence dominates ("Lena's gaze...," "Lena's thoughts...," "Lena's eyes...," "Lena's role..."). The final third contains extensive paraphrase loops where consecutive paragraphs restate the same insights about impermanence without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "rationally rebellious" appears three times with minimal variation, multiple paragraphs restate Kael's determination to preserve knowledge, and abstract descriptors ("fierce curiosity," "fierce determination") replace specific action. Template cadence emerges in "Kael's thoughts turned to... He knew that... Kael's was a..." The prose achieves atmospheric density but lacks the propulsion and concrete specificity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and redundancy pervade the text - the concept of harmony/unity is restated in nearly identical terms across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence with "As she..." openings appears repeatedly. Abstract descriptors like "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" lack concrete grounding, creating opacity rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting plagues the piece: "testament to forgotten dreams," "whispers of the past that lingered," "crucible for transformation." Template phrasing appears throughout ("On this particular day," "As she worked"). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over momentum, with multiple paraphrase loops (greenhouse described three different ways in opening paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive template phrasing ("The toll keeper's eyes lit up," "eyes sparkled," "eyes met hers") and abstract emotional labels ("sense of satisfaction," "newfound appreciation"). Critical paraphrase loop: "preserving wonder in the routine" appears twice nearly identically. Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("began to inspect," "observed, mesmerized").

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "sense of reverence and awe"/"with a sense of reverence," "houses that felt alive"/"essence of its aliveness," "forever changed by the experience"/"had been forever changed." Abstract descriptors proliferate without concrete specificity ("otherworldly energy," "latent energy," "hidden rhythms"). The phrase "streetlights...daydreaming with a soft, ethereal glow" strains metaphor coherence, conflating the required element with unrelated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "forgotten underwater city garden" appears 4 times, "animate the lifeless" 3 times, extensive paraphrase loops throughout. Template cadence dominates: "The statue [verb]" opens most paragraphs. Purple prose ("ethereal light," "vibrant, pulsing life") substitutes for concrete detail, while abstract nouns proliferate without specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe repetition issues throughout: "infinite staircase" appears 7 times, "grim optimist/optimism" 4 times, "dice" 16 times. Template cadence dominates ("As I climbed," "As I ascended," "As I continued"). Abstract phrases like "texture of a missed opportunity" and "otherworldly energy" provide no concrete imagery. The prose loops without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "lost languages" appears 7 times, "smog" and "pollution" recur without variation, multiple paragraphs begin with "The painter" or "She." Lines like "surrounded by the whispers of the past" and "promise of a brighter future" read as workshop clichés. Template cadence runs throughout ("The painter's X...She had Y...As she Z").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive overwriting mars the prose: "wisps of mist from the monumental waterfall dissipated," "ethereal light," "sparkled as she pointed." Template cadence appears throughout ("Elena's eyes...", "Elena explained...", "Elena's thoughts..."). The phrase "stories that lay just beneath the surface" repeats verbatim. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the preservation theme without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive overwriting with purple prose ("wind whipping his hair into a frenzy," "latent radiance," "otherworldly light") creates distance rather than immediacy. Template cadence appears in repetitive "As he..." constructions. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same information ("stepped beyond fate's design" appears three times with minimal variation). The prose prioritizes ornamental description over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from template horror phrasing ("loomed before me," "shiver run down my spine," "terrible revelation"). Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same information ("lingering luminance" concept restated without advancement). Filter-heavy construction ("I felt," "I knew," "I caught sight") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The air was filled with an expectant hush" followed by near-identical restatements about held breath and vibrating energy). Template cadence appears in repetitive "The prophet's [noun]" constructions, and abstract descriptors ("restless euphony," "haunting") replace concrete sensory detail in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues throughout: "Lyra felt" appears 8 times, "sense of" 5 times, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound ("The watchers on the horizon seemed to loom larger with every step, their silence a palpable, oppressive force" immediately follows similar watchers description). The filter-verb stack and abstract phrasing ("weight of," "sense of") dull immediacy, particularly in what should be the high-pressure ending.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting mars momentum: "skeletal fingers," "morbid perfume," "veil of time" pile up without purpose. Template cadence appears throughout ("She had spent...," "She would do this...," "She pored over..."). The paraphrase loop in paragraphs 14-15 restates the noble lie concept without advancement. Heavy reliance on abstract telling ("fierce determination," "sense of satisfaction") replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("The surveyor's..." appears 5 times, "As the surveyor..." 4 times) creating template cadence. Abstract phrases like "interlaced absence" and "hushed blaze" appear without sufficient grounding. Information density varies—some paragraphs advance little beyond restatement of the preservation theme.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition problems pervade the text: "Elara felt" appears 8 times, "sense of" 7 times, creating template cadence. Abstract descriptors like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" substitute for concrete imagery, while paraphrase loops waste words (lines 8-9 essentially repeat the same discovery concept).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting issues: abstract emotional labels proliferate ("poignant reflection," "ethereal beauty," "quiet reverence"), creating density without precision. Multiple paraphrase loops occur (grief transformation is restated at least four times), and the piece suffers from template cadence in its repetitive "Kaito's [noun]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Amira felt," "Amira knew," "As she") and paraphrase loops dilute momentum—"unfiltered awakening" appears twice, "intangibly tangible" three times without evolution. Abstract phrasing like "magnitude of their discovery" and "beacon, illuminating the path ahead, and beckoning her towards" creates redundancy. The prose tells emotional states rather than embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive redundancy weakens momentum: "sense of anticipation"/"sense of expectation," "brilliant dimness" appears three times without evolution, "missing pieces" echoes mechanically. Template phrasing dominates emotional beats: "felt a sense of," "knew that she," "began to." The prose tells about mystery and wonder rather than creating it through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive emotional scaffolding: "melancholy haven," "mournful sigh," "growing sense of unease," "tempered regret" create synonym loops without advancing pressure. Template constructions like "She recalled...She was...She knew..." and filter-heavy passages ("she felt the weight," "seemed to be," "began to form") dull immediacy, particularly in what should be peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "mist swirling/swirled around her" appears 6 times, "testament to" twice in close proximity, multiple "reminder of" constructions. Template cadence runs ("She [verb], her [object]" pattern) and abstract noun chains ("calm determination," "fragile balance," "delicate craftsmanship") create sluggish pacing without information density.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "Jack felt" appears 8 times, "sense of" 7 times, with template cadence ("As he...Jack felt") recurring throughout. The text loops through synonym cycles for the same emotional states (peace/calm/resolve, regrets/failures/mistakes) without advancing meaning, creating a paraphrase-heavy momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the prose: "labyrinth of choices"/"complex web of decisions," "jaded wonder"/"mix of cynicism and awe." Template cadence runs appear: "As she walked...As she stood...As she gazed...As she walked." The final third contains multiple scaffold sentences that restate without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "reluctant metamorphosis"/"beginning of her reluctant metamorphosis," "cosmic intimacy"/"cosmic level," "paradoxically steady" repeated without evolution. Template fantasy phrasing ("silvery glow," "otherworldly light," "electric anticipation") replaces specific imagery. Filter-heavy construction in emotional peaks ("Lyra felt," "she sensed," "she knew") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("ethereal glow," "otherworldly energy," "inexplicable connection") and template phrases ("sense of understanding begin to dawn," "sense of peace settle over her"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same emotional beats without advancement, particularly around the concept of understanding and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "steadfast pacifist"/"deep sense of resolve"/"ghostly resolve" repeat the same quality without advancement. Template cadence appears in "As she..." constructions repeated across paragraphs. The prose achieves some lyrical moments but suffers from abstract telling ("felt the weight of their emotions settle upon her") rather than concrete showing. Filter-verb stacks in emotional passages ("felt," "seemed," "began") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the prose: "whispering hush" variations repeat without advancement, and abstract assertions like "texture of transformation" and "complex web of connections" substitute for concrete imagery. Template cadence ("Aria felt...Aria knew...She had always been") creates monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition mars the prose: "silent revolution" appears 7 times, "cradle of sparks" 9 times, creating synonym loops rather than accumulation. Template phrasing dominates ("As she...," "The sentinel...") with limited syntactic variety. The final eight paragraphs loop the same abstract concepts about revolution and new eras without advancing meaning. Information density remains low despite the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive sentence openings ("The herder's eyes," "The herder's task," "The herder's precognitively cursed nature") create template cadence. Abstract phrasing like "weight of unfulfilled prophecies" and "essence of creation" lacks concrete specificity, though the ritualistic rhythm suits the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive paraphrase loops pervade the text ("cartography of scars" appears 4 times, conceptual redundancy about storms/turbulence/tempest). Template cadence runs ("The poet..." starts 8 sentences) and abstract descriptors ("otherworldly glow," "hidden patterns") replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition plagues the prose: "diplomatically fierce" appears three times, the danish tin sewing needle card is mentioned eight times with identical phrasing, and template constructions like "As he [verb]" dominate. Abstract padding ("a testament to," "a palpable force," "etched in his mind") dilutes momentum. The final third especially suffers from paraphrase loops restating the same philosophical abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("The poet's thoughts turned to..." appears multiple times) and abstract declarations ("testament to the power of art and imagination"). The final paragraph contains three consecutive sentences beginning "The poet" creating mechanical cadence, though some lyric moments land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "melancholy serenade, a lament for the love that had been lost" restates the same grief; "mist swirled around her" appears twice verbatim. Template cadence runs throughout ("She [verb]," "The pianist [verb]"). Abstract declarations like "strategically creative soul" and "steely longing" replace concrete embodiment, creating density without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Aria stood," "Aria's role," "Aria's method," "Aria smiled," "Aria vanished") creates mechanical rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content: "collective memory"/"cultural memory"/"cultural heritage" cycle without adding pressure; "memories"/"experiences"/"moments" churn synonymously. The prose tells pivotal beats ("her work was done," "memories safe") rather than dramatizing them through concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive repetition loops damage momentum: "cerulean regret" appears 5 times, "tides of remembrance" 5 times, "rhythmically placid" 3 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops ("Kaito felt the tides of remembrance continue to flow"/"felt the tides of remembrance remain") and abstract emotional summaries ("felt a sense of peace," "felt his emotions begin to untangle") replace concrete action throughout.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly abstract phrasing (e.g., "unfolding its secrets through the quiet, incremental steps") and a paraphrase loop near the end reiterating "gradual change." These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful, but minor artifacts appear. A slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("drifting resonance," "scorched testament") creates occasional abstraction. The rhythm, however, remains propulsive and supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("a sense of peace," "a feeling that was both a balm") and a few filter verbs cluster in one beat, creating a slight drag. However, these artifacts do not touch the closure beat, and the final paragraphs are flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and purposeful description. However, minor line-level artifacts prevent a higher score. There is some synonym churn ("weary," "worn down," "relentless") and a reliance on filter verbs like "felt" and "seemed" in key beats (e.g., "The undertaker felt a sense of peace"). These small choices slightly dull the immediacy of the high-pressure closure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with effective variation in sentence length and rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop between "gently persistent nature" and "gently persistent determination," and the filter phrase "Akira felt a sense of pride" which dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, with high sensory density. However, it risks overwriting in peaks (e.g., "chorus of ethereal dancers"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "unused love" repeated adjacent to "long stored away." The closure image remains clear and potent despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. Minor figurative muddle occurs in peak beats, e.g., "dissolving into a quaking reverie" slightly obscures clarity. A paraphrase loop exists between "exhilarating, yet terrifying" and "exhilarating and terrifying."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. There is high information density, with sentences often doing double duty (e.g., "scent of sugar and smoke" carrying memory). A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a template cadence in the final paragraphs ("The liberator continued to work... And as they looked out...").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "battered marvel" conveys cost, result, and theme). A minor instance of scaffold appears in "The cells were still dividing, and the memories... were still unfolding," which slightly paraphrases the prior line. This is a small artifact that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and generally effective, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is sometimes stacked ("soft, ethereal light," "fleeting golden sunset") and a paraphrase loop occurs ("secrets that lay beyond"/"secrets that lay just beyond the threshold"). These artifacts slightly dull the clarity of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive with vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("thawing heart" appears three times) and a register drift in the dramatically narrated section, which feels slightly detached from the established narrative voice, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("firmly adaptive nature" used twice) and a declarative summary in the climax ("I was ready to take on the world") that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "words dripped like honey"), which, while beautiful, creates a mild density drag without a clear pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., "remarkably composed nature" appears multiple times) and a tendency toward summary in the looped timeline sections. The closure beat, however, remains unaffected and lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "freed by honesty" / "thaw mistrust with transparency") and a template cadence in several sentences starting with "The registrar," which slightly reduces momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor instances of synonym churn ("bittersweet aroma... comforting") and a template cadence in the final paragraphs prevent a higher score, though closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor artifact is the repetition of "icy warmth," which creates a slight paraphrase loop. Figurative language is largely effective and coherent, supporting the accumulative build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor instance of synonymous phrasing ("unstruck chords" and "lingered in the air" reappear) creates a slight loop, but it is patterned and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact is the phrase "auroral sorrow," which feels slightly elevated and decorative for the POV's lexicon in the peak beat, applying a small deduction. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "drowsy alertness" feels slightly contrived and therapy-adjacent, though it is quickly anchored in the physical sensation of listening to the radio. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, momentum is occasionally dragged by repetitive phrasing ("the chronicle keeper" is used 18 times) and near-synonym loops ("unravel," "loosen," "detachment"). These artifacts are noticeable but do not critically obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on soft, mellifluous adjectives ("gentle," "softly," "mellow") which, while tonally appropriate, creates a occasional textural sameness. No major artifacts or loops obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory specificity. However, minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("whispers of forgotten tales"/"whispers of the past") and a slightly over-written cadence in places (e.g., "a realm of bronze quiet where the past and present blended seamlessly"). These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and atmosphere. However, it suffers from minor synonym churn ("cryptic," "enigma," "mystery," "prophetic") and a repetitive cadence in describing the Oracle's actions (e.g., "orchestrate," "direct the flow"), which slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is occasionally stacked ("muffled clarity," "sonic landscape"), creating slight density without payoff. A few filter verbs ("seemed to") dull immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor pattern of dense figurative language appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "conductor of unheard symphonies," "cartography of the writer's childhood") which, while purposeful, slightly blurs sense and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a template cadence is present from the repeated use of full noun phrases ("the gravity defier," "the ancient clay tablet with runes"). This artifact, while not fatal, dulls the closure's impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a paraphrasing loop: "a feeling that the world was full of hidden patterns" slightly restates the prior "sense of wonder." No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong and atmospheric. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("pondered the message"/"pondered the implications") and a slightly excessive use of adjectives in descriptive passages ("gentle rustle," "soft chirping," "sweet scent"), which slightly dilute momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor deductions for repetitive phrasing ("Elara felt") and a template cadence in places ("The air was thick...", "Her gaze fell upon..."). These artifacts are present but do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor scaffold is present in repetitive phrasing ("uncovering layers, revealing truths, and discovering the texture of time") which slightly dulls momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat: "a poignant harmony that filled the greenhouse" feels slightly summary-like compared to the more embodied descriptions surrounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with strong rhythm and sensory density. Minor artifacts include near-redundant phrases ("soft glow" / "warm, honey-like light") and occasional filter verbs ("she felt").

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight scaffold feel in listing their ideas ("Lena proposed... Sophia suggested...") and a near-paraphrase loop describing their friendship's growth at the end. These do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and purposefully dense, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward summary in the emotional arc ("Kael felt truly connected"), but the line-level craft is strong, with no loops or artifacts that obscure causality. The final paragraph's cadence effectively lands the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong with vivid imagery, but occasional overwriting ("sculpts time itself by an invisible hand") and a minor paraphrase loop ("borrow fragments of the giant's time" / "borrowed chronology").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and vivid, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective, landing the charged poise with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("kindly methodical soul") appears twice, and the simile "like stars" is slightly generic. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor artifacts include a few instances of near-paraphrase (e.g., "growth and renewal" / "beauty and growth") and a slight register drift toward the abstract in peak beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, effectively building atmosphere. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a hint of thesaurus-churn (e.g., "inexplicable connection," "wryly earnest sense").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a few instances of near-synonym churn ("serene and enchanting," "fierce and gentle") and a single filter-verb stack ("Aria realized," "Aria found herself") that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely polished and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract summary in key beats (e.g., "she sensed a flicker of understanding") and a few near-synonym phrases ("sense of renewal," "overwhelming urge") that slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in consecutive sentences starting with "As she..." and a synonym loop on "secrets" and "mysteries." These do not severely obscure closure but slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on "as" constructions for simultaneity and some abstract phrasing ("topography of the mind"). These do not obscure causality but prevent a higher score. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that accelerate with the storm's intensity. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor scaffold phrase ("Kael's heart, long thought to be still, stirred") slightly dulls the peak beat, but clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a cluster of filter verbs ("Lena felt," "she knew") in the climax and a slight register drift in phrases like "deathly vitality," which feels overly poetic for the POV. These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor scaffold issues, including some repetitive phrasing ("textures," "essence") and a template cadence in describing the act of charting. These artifacts are present but do not critically obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor text artifact exists: a run of sentences starting with "The survivor's..." or "The labyrinth..." creates a template cadence that slightly reduces propulsion, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is concise and propulsive, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence, but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, advancing the narrative with good momentum. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract thematic language (e.g., "essence," "spirit") and some repetitive sentence structures in descriptive passages, though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a template cadence in the final paragraphs ("The stillness... was almost palpable, a dawning hush... a poignant reminder"). This creates a slight rhythmic monotony and abstraction near the closure, dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for a few instances of slightly ornate phrasing ("swirled around the idle trains like a living entity") and a near-paraphrase loop describing the depot's tranquility, but these do not harm closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good information density. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("growing sense of excitement"/"growing sense of urgency") and a template cadence in describing the setting's atmosphere, but these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of "wild hush" and a near-paraphrase loop ("stir from their slumber" / "sleeper awakening"). Rhythm is expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor," which feel slightly repetitive and thematic-echo-like. The closure beat is clear, but the phrasing could be more embodied to avoid summary.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is highly atmospheric and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic flow. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the phrase "copperlight repose" feels slightly overwrought, and a paraphrase loop occurs between "chasing the whispers" and "seeking to uncover the truth." These do not, however, obscure the closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, some overwriting occurs: "lovingly venomous" is a contradictory metaphor that muddles clarity, and "mournful elation" risks abstraction. Minor synonym churn appears ("ephemeral cameo appearances" followed by "ephemeral appearances"). The closure image remains clear despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with good rhythm and variety. However, minor artifacts appear: a synonym loop ("weave" / "sew" / "craft") and occasional register drift into abstract nouns ("precedents," "reverence") that slightly dull the tactile immediacy of the weaving process, though closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards slightly abstract summary in places (e.g., "purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") and a few repetitive stems that slightly dull momentum. The closure image, however, remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is elegant and controlled, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic flow that support the meditative tone. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor overwriting exists ("futuristic nostalgia" feels slightly forced), but no major artifacts, loops, or clarity issues obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. However, minor overwriting is present, with a density of figurative language that occasionally flirts with abstraction (e.g., "weaving a tale of its own"). A few near-duplicate phrases ("shimmer and glow") create slight synonym churn. These artifacts are decorative and do not obscure closure, but they prevent a higher score by introducing moments of mild stylistic inflation rather than relentless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and vivid, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor instance of near-synonym use ("sorrow and regret") appears but does not create a loop or obscure closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor synonym churn ("unknot the tangled threads... slowly unraveling") and a stacked modifier ("lotus-hearted ache") that slightly muddles the peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a near-paraphrase loop ("dreamlike world" / "beyond the edge of reality") and the slightly cliché "spark reignite." These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "hobo nickel rotated slowly" establishes character, object, and mood). A minor -0.4 deduction for a template cadence in the final paragraph ("As she worked...", "With a sense...") and a slight figurative muddle in "nested awakenings," though clarity is never truly obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, effectively building atmosphere. Points are deducted for minor text artifacts, including a repetitive cadence (e.g., "The greenhouse became a hub... Lyra's reputation spread...") and the slightly overused phrase "converging chaos."

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors ("galaxy postcard, once a simple reminder... became a catalyst"), creating slight density without full payoff, but clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the caretaker's purpose (e.g., "preserve the sound... echoes of a past"), and the phrase "foxglove regret" risks decorative labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and variation. Information density is excellent, with lines serving multiple functions (e.g., the ink well description establishes character, setting, and theme). A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstraction in peak beats ("symphonies of truth," "fabric of reality altered"), which creates a small figurative muddle amidst otherwise concrete, embodied writing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-stacked in high-pressure beats (e.g., "symphony of purpose," "dappled resolve"), creating minor decorative density. A paraphrase loop exists between "harmonize" and "harmony" near the end, slightly dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and good rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present, including a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("vintage bookshop," "newfound sense") and some synonymous phrasing ("musty scent of aged paper" / "musty smell of aged paper"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is sometimes over-applied in high-pressure beats (e.g., "colors bleeding like watercolors"). A template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "The" or "I," creating a slight rhythmic monotony that dulls momentum, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often lush and evocative, but suffers from occasional overwriting and synonym churn (e.g., "shadowseam wonder," "softly ingenious methods"). The rhythm is generally strong, though some figurative language feels slightly forced, preventing a higher score despite the overall high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor instance of near-paraphrase occurs ("uncover the secrets" / "unraveling its secrets") but does not obscure closure or causality. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a template cadence ("As he...", "With a...") in a few sentence openers and a slight over-reliance on compound sentences in reflective passages, creating a mild momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is densely poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion. Minor register drift in "obsidian grace" feels slightly elevated for the POV but is consistent with the voice. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; rhythm supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. It successfully avoids summary in pivotal beats. Minor artifacts are present, including a template cadence from repeated "She felt a sense of..." constructions and a register drift into slightly elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings") that feels less native to the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "slow dance of celestial bodies," and slight synonym churn ("fractured soul" / "cracked porcelain") appears, but clarity and momentum remain intact, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("exhilarating and terrifying") and occasional elevated diction ("serene upheaval") that creates slight register drift in a high-pressure beat, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional synonym churn ("secrets and stories") and a few filter verbs that create small momentum drags, but the line-level craft is largely exemplary and supports the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but risks overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a dusky harmony that seemed to pulse with the borrowed heartbeat that drove her"). This creates minor figurative density and a slight loss of propulsion near the climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop between "the price of redemption was steep" and "the cost of failure was far greater," and the phrase "flawed beauty" feels slightly applied. However, these do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("newly-restored," "fractured grace") and a repetitive stem in "echo of extinct birds" which, while thematic, borders on decorative repetition in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally elegant and propulsive, but suffers from minor overwriting. The mixed metaphor in "alarming serenity" and the somewhat forced "harvest of echoes" create coherence issues. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats without a fully taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, effectively building atmosphere. However, some clichéd phrasing ("creative juices stirring") and a repetitive stem ("The campfire story stick...") in consecutive paragraphs create minor artifacts that slightly dull the closure's clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but risks overwriting in places (e.g., "atmosphere of blushing stillness"). A few synonym loops ("fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful") and a register drift slightly dull momentum, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, a few phrases, notably "snowmelt ardor," feel slightly overwrought and introduce a minor register drift that slightly dulls the clarity of the peak beat, though closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "a precisely playful manner" and "a grit that was both captivating and humbling," which feel slightly redundant and dilute the clarity of high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm that supports the accumulative drive. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake") is pattern-taught and pays off, without obscuring clarity or causing momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("a reminder of the fragility of harmony" and "a reminder that even in the most discordant of times, harmony was possible") and some elevated diction that occasionally feels slightly detached from the immediate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential register drift ("morbid perfume") is brief and voice-motivated, not harming clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor scaffold phrases like "It was as if" slightly soften an otherwise potent closure image, but no artifacts harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing the curator's state ("brightened disquiet," "sense of purpose"), but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with strong information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: some synonymous phrasing ("wonder and awe," "secrets and mysteries") and a register drift in the climax with "crescendo of understanding," which feels slightly elevated for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor scaffold and a cliché ("thrill of excitement"). Figurative language is mostly coherent and supports the atmosphere, though a mixed metaphor ("labyrinthine corridors of her own mind") slightly muddles a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and vivid sensory selection. However, a cluster of filter verbs in a high-pressure beat ("Emilia noticed," "Emilia felt," "Emilia realized") creates a minor scaffold, deducting -0.5 and disallowing a 9+ score. The closure image remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is competent and often vivid, but suffers from minor artifacts. There is some synonym churn ("cacophony," "din," "discord") and a tendency toward summary in key moments, such as the energy beings adjusting their resonance, which is stated rather than dramatized. The rhythm is consistent but could benefit from more variation to match rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but some overwriting is present. The phrase "a shard of hush fell into their hand" is a mixed metaphor (hush cannot be a shard) that slightly muddles clarity at a key beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifact deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative language in peak beats (e.g., "swirled around her") which, while beautiful, creates a small muddle that slightly dulls the causal clarity of the memory transfer moment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from mild paraphrase loops (e.g., "creativity" and "inspiration" appear frequently) and a template cadence in reflective passages. The closure image remains clear, though momentum drags slightly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic flow and vivid sensory detail. Minor deductions for a tendency toward slightly over-written phrases (e.g., "explore the mysteries of time") that briefly lean ornamental, but overall density and propulsion are excellent, and closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight figurative density in the climax ("seeds taking root," "tapestry") that, while beautiful, softens the immediacy of the peak beat. No loops, scaffolds, or major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but risks overwriting with dense figurative language in some beats (e.g., "vaulting hush"). A few near-paraphrase loops ("serene surroundings," "serene glow") and the repeated stem "seemed to be" create minor scaffold artifacts that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacts. Some synonymous phrasing ("forgotten grandeur," "mere shadow") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") create slight redundancy. The rhythm is strong, but these small lapses in concision prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and conceptual label-speak appear in high-pressure beats, such as "loaded emptiness" and "teach suffocating to breathe," which slightly muddle clarity and immediacy. A light deduction for this artifact, which does not severely harm closure but lessens the line-level impact at key moments. The sentence-level propulsion otherwise maintains good momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythmic variety. Minor artifacts are present, including the slightly forced "shadowseam wonder" and a template cadence in "Lyra laughed... Lyra knew... Lyra smiled." These do not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards synonym churn ("eloquently silent," "reverent touch") and a repetitive cadence in listing the story's themes in the final paragraphs, which slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery, but suffers from minor overwriting in high-pressure beats. Phrases like "shivering bliss" and "electric sense of anticipation" are slightly abstract and veer toward label-speak. A template cadence emerges in several sentences starting with "The knight's...", creating a mild repetitive stem.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold issues and a tendency toward paraphrase loops ("forgotten stories," "unknown histories") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is generally effective but occasionally stacks in high-pressure beats without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic flow. However, minor overwriting is present, with some stacked modifiers ("peculiar object," "otherworldly glow") and a tendency toward abstract thematic language that slightly blurs immediacy in peak beats, though it doesn't break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vividly atmospheric but occasionally overwrought, with a high density of figurative language that slightly blurs sense in peak beats (e.g., "music seeps into the mist, spreading through negative space"). Minor synonym churn ("vested hush" appears twice) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is dense throughout, and there is some synonym churn (e.g., "mystical, otherworldly place"). These artifacts are present but do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but minor artifacts include the repetitive phrase "uncertainly certain" and a slight register drift in "ethereal light." These do not obscure closure, though they dull peak beats slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally lush and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacting. The phrase "luminous regret" is repeated, and near-synonyms like "melancholy mist" and "rain-washed" create a slight decorative loop. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("restless dead" / "restless energy") and a template cadence in the final paragraphs ("The echo gorge was..."). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Information density is high. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in the climax with "mathematics of mercy" and "comprehend it," but it is brief and does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but minor artifacts appear. The phrase "elusively tangible" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. There is also a register drift in "afire with the eternal instant," which feels elevated compared to the surrounding text, slightly dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally crisp and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor flaw is the repetitive use of the phrase "weightless burden" in the final beats, which creates a slight echo and diminishes the conceptual impact. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor density issues and some repetitive phrasing (e.g., "swirling clouds," "rustling awakenings"). A few mixed metaphors ("tentative fingers" of clouds) slightly reduce clarity, though momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor instances of near-paraphrase occur (e.g., "reimagine, to recreate, and to rediscover"), and the phrase "burnished sorrow" is repeated frequently, slightly dulling its impact by the closure though not breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive, successfully building a textured atmosphere. There is a minor tendency toward dense figurative language ("covenant of rust," "tether the very essence of sound") that, while purposeful, occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats, slightly impeding momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "unfolding its secrets like a lotus flower," a slightly strained metaphor that doesn't fully cohere with the established setting. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns ("significance," "exploration") in peak beats and a near-paraphrase loop ("hidden patterns and connections" repeated in the final lines). Clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "The [noun]," and a minor paraphrase loop occurs around "secrets" and "mysteries." These artifacts are slight and do not materially obscure the closure's clarity or cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, though "solemn" repeats. No loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language ("heart ablaze") supports pressure without muddle. Minor scaffold in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym loop ("fierce intensity"/"fierce determination") and a filter phrase ("It was as if..."). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("velvet disquiet") is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor deduct for a few instances of passive phrasing ("seemed to be") that slightly dull immediacy, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic, purposeful imagery ("a thousand tiny mirrors," "kaleidoscope of images"). The prose is lucid and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding. The rhythm is controlled and varied, perfectly supporting the mystical tone. A single instance of near-redundancy ("beauty and wonder") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid sensory language, and a compelling read-aloud rhythm. There is a minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("benediction") at the closure, but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. The line-level execution is nearly flawless, sustaining momentum and purpose throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. However, it suffers from a repetitive cadence and some conceptual redundancy (e.g., multiple iterations of "flourishing stillness"). These artifacts, while not fatal, create a slight drag on momentum and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "canopy of light") and a near-paraphrase loop between "weight of unspoken words" and "unspoken words." Clarity and momentum remain excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from minor scaffold issues, including paraphrase loops ("The timekeeper's...") and a template cadence in descriptions. Figurative language is mostly effective but occasionally strains ("vibrated with an air").

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on visual description and a few near-synonyms ("burnished hush," "soothing melody") create a subtle decorative loop in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is consistently strong, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor deductions for occasional slight abstraction ("vibrant, thriving entity") and a repetitive use of "gently systematic," but clarity and momentum are never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor instance of potential register drift with the phrase "chemistry of homecoming," which feels slightly academic for the POV's internal lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, though it occasionally flirts with over-writing (e.g., "narrow vastness"). Rhythm is controlled and supports the contemplative tone. A few minor synonym churns ("blooming," "teeming") prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("scarred and barren," "devastation") in early paragraphs and a template cadence in "The air was heavy... but Lyra and Kael pushed forward." These do not obscure closure. The final paragraphs achieve a clean, rhythmic cadence that supports the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("stars twinkling like diamonds") is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift were detected. The sentence-level propulsion expertly mirrors the narrative's shift from stillness to movement.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative language in high-pressure beats ("swirling vortex of chaos") edges toward decorative density without significant payoff, causing a slight deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Sentences advance atmosphere and concept efficiently. Minor deductions for slightly abstract phrasing in peaks (e.g., "nomadic penumbra," "coalescing around them") and a near-paraphrase loop between "unbind the past" and "uncover the small gestures." Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor overwriting. A cluster of dense figurative language in the high-pressure climax beat ("swirling mists," "texture of a feather") creates a slight muddle, obscuring the clarity of the decisive action and its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly evocative and generally concise, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense, figurative language creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a woven hush that wrapped around the tutor like a shroud" followed by more layered description). This artifact slightly obscures the causal clarity of the inciting decoding action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "forged hush," creating a slight figurative muddle, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on the "creaked and groaned" construction for the workshop and some near-paraphrase in describing the task. These are minor artifacts that do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a template cadence ("As she worked...", "As she gazed...") and a cluster of filter verbs in the oasis discovery beat ("she felt a sense of peace," "she felt a sense of connection"). These slightly dull the immediacy of a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and purposefully dense, with high information density. While generally effective, there is minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "a screaming tenderness that threatened to overwhelm him"). The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final image is clear and resonant, though a few phrases could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a template cadence is detected in consecutive sentences starting with "The navigator..." and a paraphrase loop exists between "geography of loss" and "topography of loss and memory." These minor artifacts slightly dull the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a pattern of therapeutic label-speak ("psychological safety," "confront the trauma," "emotional scars") in key beats, which abstracts embodied experience and slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few near-paraphrases ("lost in thought" / "lost in thought"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful, effectively building an accumulative rhythm. However, minor text artifacts are present, including a template cadence in listing the chip's role and some synonym churn (e.g., "secrets," "mystery," "secrets" again). These do not obscure closure but prevent a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but risks overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "sense of trepidation," "sense of foreboding" create minor synonym loops). Figurative language is generally coherent and supports atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a tendency toward abstract nominalizations (e.g., "a sense of directed spontaneity"). This creates slight momentum drag in places, though it never fully obscures causality or the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly controlled, rhythmic, and dense with purpose. There is a minor tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "jumble of images," "tangled mix," "tangled threads") which creates a slight textural loop, preventing a flawless score. However, this is a minor artifact that does not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. Minor issues include a tendency toward slightly abstract phrasing ("deeper truths that lay hidden") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("unveiling the ordinary miracles" is repeated). These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally veers into overwriting, such as the slightly mixed metaphor in "stories flowed through him like a river" following the "saturated hush." This creates minor figurative muddle in a peak beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally fluid and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few abstract nouns ("reverence," "desperation") where more concrete embodiment would be stronger. The closure image remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("In the resounding hush that remained, she knew..." followed by "The witness had done her work...") and a tendency toward abstract nominalizations ("understanding," "balance"). Figurative language is consistent and legible, though dense, without muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, with good rhythmic variety and high information density. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight register drift in phrases like "eminently peculiar" and "razor edges of time" feels slightly elevated for the POV, and there is a hint of paraphrase between "serene landscape" and "fjord quiet."

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is largely fluid and evocative, but suffers from minor artifacts: a template cadence in lists ("The familiar strangers, the mushrooms, and the laser pointer button...") and a mixed metaphor ("quiet wildfire" conflating calm and chaos). These slightly dull the closure's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including a tendency towards abstract nouns ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") and a repetitive cadence in some reflective passages. These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the immediacy and momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clean and purposeful, but suffers from minor repetition (e.g., multiple uses of "loop" and "cultivated estrangement") that creates a slight scaffold effect. The rhythm is effectively hypnotic, matching the theme, though it occasionally borders on synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present, including a tendency for synonym churn ("haunted euphoria" is repeated) and some slightly decorative phrasing ("walnut-ink archivist"). These do not obscure causality but slightly dilute the line-level precision needed for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive with strong sensory imagery. There is high information density, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A very minor artifact: the phrase "desperately jocular" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control. However, slight overwriting and repetitive phrasing ("quiet blaze" x2, "symphony of sounds") create minor density issues in high-pressure beats. The closure image remains clear and impactful despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences restating similar ideas (e.g., "not just about restoring a pen but about understanding..."), but no major artifacts muddy closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is polished with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language ("symphony of silence") is purposeful and coherent, without artifacts or loops. Read-aloud flow is strong, and momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven lines.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense and often purposeful, but suffers from overwriting in high-pressure beats, with stacked modifiers and abstract emotional labels that obscure clarity. Figurative language is occasionally mixed (e.g., "spark of inspiration" followed by "volcanic tenderness"). Rhythm is generally controlled, but some sentences lack propulsion due to nominalizations.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor issues include a tendency toward abstract emotional labels ("profound stillness," "auroral sorrow") and some repetitive phrasing around "entangled memories" and "shared dream." Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid, concrete language. The noted filter verb stack ("She felt a thrill...", "She smiled to herself, knowing...") in the climax creates a minor momentum drag and applies a -0.5 deduction, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, slight overwriting and a few stacked modifiers ("intricate design," "otherworldly light") create minor density artifacts in high-pressure beats, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong atmospheric description. Minor issues include a tendency towards slightly abstract phrasing (e.g., "cradling the weight of the world in his mind") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("bathed in an atmosphere of contemplation, the air thick with the scent of second thoughts"). The closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the climax (e.g., "like a lotus blooming") and a paraphrase loop near the end with "freedom" and "peace," which slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats and the phrase "remade hush" feeling slightly precious upon repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity, even in peak beats. A minor tendency toward synonym churn ("tremor of certainty," "sense of liberation") exists but does not obscure the closure image or cause significant momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts are present: a near-paraphrase loop ("beauty of imperfection was being redefined" / "story of imperfection and beauty") and a filter verb ("he began to ponder") that slightly dulls immediacy. These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character. Minor density issues occur in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a sense that was both a comfort and a challenge" feels slightly abstract). Rhythm is varied and supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is largely clear and concise with strong momentum. However, minor figurative over-density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "weave their magic into the fabric of the world"), and a template cadence run ("a sense of hope, a sense that they would continue to bloom") slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, though it occasionally trends toward overwriting ("inherited mystery of the craft was palpable"). Minor synonym churn ("steadily curious," "driven by a desire") and a reliance on abstract nouns slightly dull the texture. The closure image, however, remains clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a register drift in high-pressure beats (e.g., "across the end of innocence, a threshold beyond which lay a realm of unmitigated truth"). This creates a slight loss of momentum and clarity at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacting appears in a few peak beats: "luminous regret" and "soft, ethereal light" exhibit a slight synonym churn and register elevation. These do not obscure closure but dull the immediacy slightly. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor issues include a tendency toward synonym churn ("reconstructing," "shedding," "peeling back") and a slightly over-relied-upon phrase ("shimmering stillness") that creates a mild template cadence, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. However, minor artifacts are present, including a near-paraphrase loop ("whispers of the plants" / "gentle susurrus") and slightly overwrought phrasing like "meteor hush" which momentarily stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a minor prose artifact appears: a near-paraphrase loop between "enduring power of love" and "enduring power of human emotion" in close succession, which slightly dulls the momentum of a key thematic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but exhibits minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "shadowed rapture that filled the archway, a mix of darkness and light that was both captivating and unnerving"). This slightly muddles clarity without serving a clear pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is largely exquisite with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A deduction is applied for a minor figurative muddle in the peak beat ("kaleidoscope of color and sound, a fractured lullaby") which slightly obscures the clarity of the climax moment without serving a clear pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but shows minor signs of figurative density, particularly in clusters like "symphony of vibrations" and "cacophony of understanding." This creates a slight drag on momentum in high-pressure beats, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely lucid and atmospheric, effectively building mood. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on the "shrouded" motif ("mist-shrouded," "veiled") and the repetitive invocation of the "shoreline lullaby," which softens the impact of an otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor prose artifact is present: a paraphrase loop between "the cost of safety" and "the price that they had paid" in the reflective block, which slightly dulls momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slightly cliché descriptor ("eyes, like two glittering stars") and a template cadence in the description of the box and ink pellet. Rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally strong, with varied rhythm, high information density, and clear propulsion. It successfully avoids loops, scaffolds, and figurative muddle. The read-aloud quality is excellent, particularly in passages describing the drumming and the ocean's sounds. It is publishable at the line level with only the most minor of quibbles.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The hum grew louder, a thunderous serenity that enveloped her"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing the plants' whispers, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting occurs in clustered metaphors (e.g., "branding iron," "burning a hole," "endless expanse of blue-gray silk") within high-pressure beats, causing a slight figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor overwriting is present in peak beats with stacked figurative language ("luminescent ache of creativity"), but it serves the accumulative pattern and does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("ephemeral patterns" / "patterns that had already begun to fade") and the phrase "serene anger" which, while compelling, risks being a label. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight register drift in phrases like "bravely conflicted heart," but clarity and momentum are maintained through the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but suffers from some repetition and synonym churn (e.g., "serene dedication," "serene world," "tranquil blaze," "soothing presence"). This creates a slight looping effect that, while thematically appropriate, marginally reduces momentum and clarity, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sleepwalking constellations," "feral lullaby") that, while beautiful, creates a slight textural density in peak beats without adding causal pressure. The sentence-level propulsion, however, remains clear and advances the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear and concise with strong momentum, advancing story and character. Figurative language ("orbits of regret," "web of logic") is purposeful and generally coherent. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the repeated use of "Adelaide's [noun], [adjective]" sentence stems, though it does not significantly obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. Minor overwriting occurs in the peak beat ("a silence that was both calming and unsettling"), creating a slight figurative muddle, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "The sand mandala was a reflection..." is nearly repeated) and a tendency toward decorative phrasing ("lilac unease") that slightly muddles clarity in peak beats without fully obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("a sense of purpose that drove her forward, even in the face of overwhelming devastation"), but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor density issues appear in high-pressure beats with stacked figurative language ("swirling vortex of sound and light"), creating a slight muddle that prevents a higher score, though clarity is not fundamentally harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and generally concise, with strong sensory detail and varied syntax. Minor issues include repetitive stems ("Luna's somatic markers...") and a slight overuse of figurative language in peak beats ("sea of mental images"), but clarity and momentum are maintained, and closure is unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and well-crafted, with strong sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("driven by a desire... driven by a sense of wonder") and a template cadence in a few consecutive sentences starting with "The air...". These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs: "the silence... was not empty, but rather a palpable, unearthed silence" uses near-synonyms ("empty"/"unearthed") in a loop that slightly obscures sense. This artifact does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely fluid and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, mild overwriting appears in clusters, such as "a searing presence that drove her forward" following the strong "memory of the flames remained," creating a slight paraphrase loop that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety that accelerates and breathes with the scene. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The phrase "spindrift serenity" risks slight preciousness but is legible and voice-motivated, causing only a hairline slip not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful, sustaining a hypnotic rhythm. Minor artifacting appears in near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "fractured timelines" reiterated) and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor instances of near-paraphrase occur (e.g., "sense of peace" / "sense of purpose"), but they do not significantly impede momentum or clarity. The closure image remains sharp and unburdened by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. However, minor artifacts appear, including a template cadence in lists ("The tidal library... The stone circle's gentle hum... The sundial...") and a tendency toward synonym churn ("quiet reverence," "secrets," "whispers"). Rhythm is effective but can become slightly uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("Lena had always been driven by a desire to understand the intricate web" followed by "she yearned to uncover the hidden patterns") and a slightly elevated register in peak beats ("prismatic quiet").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythmic control. Minor deductions for repetitive phrasing ("cautiously hopeful," "subsonic frequencies") and a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns in the concluding paragraphs, which creates a small loss of momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally strong and vivid but contains minor artifacts. A template cadence emerges in phrases like "The air was heavy...", "The music seemed to seep...", "Lyra felt...". These repetitive stems slightly dull the immediacy of otherwise well-crafted sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight density in peak beats (e.g., "lance the boil of her own emotional numbness" feels slightly therapeutic) and a template cadence in "The detective's voice was a low, furrowed hush."

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful. However, a pattern of repetitive sentence stems ("Emilia's...", "The...") and a tendency toward summary over scene ("she began to feel," "she became convinced") create minor momentum drag and reduce immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("river of light"). Minor artifacting appears in peak beats with near-synonym loops ("lost in contemplation," "sense of luminous disbelief") and a slightly over-extended metaphor ("world unfolding before them like a map"). These are small blemishes in an otherwise expertly controlled line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present, including a tendency toward slightly abstract or thematic language ("transience of value," "fundamental human impulse") and a few near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "polished calm" appears twice). These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts are present, such as the slightly repetitive structure of sentences beginning with "As she..." in the opening paragraphs, preventing a flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong and atmospheric, but suffers from minor artifacts. A template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "The druid..." or "The [noun]...". Some near-paraphrasing occurs (e.g., "ready to face whatever lay ahead"/"prepared to face it head-on"). These patterns slightly dull the closure's impact but do not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor artifact issues. A template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "As she..." in consecutive paragraphs. Occasional thesaurus-churn words like "serpentine" and "ethereal" feel slightly ornamental. These minor lapses do not, however, obscure the clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative, with good rhythm and sensory detail. A few instances of near-paraphrase loops ("sense of peace," "sense of dusky resolve") and a template cadence in one description slightly dull the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propelled with good rhythmic variety. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on "echo" motifs and a near-paraphrase loop ("spark of determination"/"spark of a new beginning"). These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation. However, a pattern of conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops is present (e.g., "reestablishing the connection," "reestablishing the balance," "secrets she was determined to uncover"/"secrets she had long sought"). This repetition dulls the closure image slightly, though it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a tendency toward decorative phrasing ("scent of saltwater and the soft lapping of waves") and a few stacked modifiers ("gentle, relentless passage of time") create minor artifacting that slightly dulls the closure image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and controlled with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("heartbeat of hesitation") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("latent radiance" repeated).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, but light synonym churn ("raw solace," "raw expression") and a template cadence in a few reflective sentences ("The river's wisdom...", "The map, once a guide...") create minor artifacts that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and controlled, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor risk of overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cautious exuberance"), but clarity and momentum are maintained. No significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor figurative overuse ("mulberry ache" feels slightly strained) and a template cadence in the final paragraph ("With the midsummer night...") slightly dull the closure's impact, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor overwriting in high-pressure beats, with a density of figurative language that occasionally blurs sense (e.g., "celestial dance," "spirit expand"). This creates a slight drag on momentum and slightly mutes the clarity of the closure image, though it does not break it.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. The phrase "vineyard hush" is a coherence artifact—a mixed metaphor that slightly obscures sense. A few adjacent sentences restate concepts ("sense of peace," "serenity"), creating subtle paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and purposeful. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("a reminder of the power of nuance and the importance of embracing the gray areas") in the final beats, slightly dulling the closure image. Otherwise, information density is high and figurative language is coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clean, concise, and possesses a controlled rhythm suited to the contemplative tone. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "The researcher knew" and "The student's eyes were fixed," but these do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and a controlled rhythm. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("multisensory awareness") and a slight over-reliance on "harmonic resonance" as a refrain, which creates a subtle template cadence. However, these do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor issues prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns ("beauty," "inspiration," "essence") in key moments and some near-paraphrase (e.g., "reignite her stagnant creativity" / "succumbing to the same fate"). These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor artifact appears with the slightly contrived phrase "meteor hush," which feels like a thesaurus-driven substitution that slightly disrupts the otherwise cohesive tone. Otherwise, the line-level craft is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic flow. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; phrases like "imbued with the essence of the coins and the static bursts" verge on redundancy. The closure image remains clear, but a few instances of near-synonym churn ("mystery and complexity") prevent a higher score. The read-aloud test is positive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A slight tendency toward summary in emotional beats ("bittersweet ache," "melancholy longing") introduces minor scaffold, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifact: the phrase "plausible impossibility" feels slightly conceptual and register-elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, creating a minor figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid, purposeful description. However, a template cadence emerges in consecutive sentences starting with "The warden's..." and a minor paraphrase loop ("shared meaning"/"narrative that would bring solace") slightly dulls momentum, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density. However, minor instances of overwriting and slightly bloated phrasing (e.g., "a knowledge that she was on the right path") create small momentum lulls. No critical artifacts or loops were found that harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, but minor synonym loops occur (e.g., "revisions began to take shape" followed by "new narrative emerging"). Figurative language is sometimes overused in high-pressure beats, slightly blurring clarity without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("a sense of peace settle over him, a sense of being fully alive") and a tendency toward abstract nouns ("determination," "clarity"). These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "storm-born silence" and "hush of a possibility just born," which feel slightly ornamental and create a small figurative muddle, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and synonym churn appear ("mournfully eager gaze," "cacophony echoing"), and the hourglass line contains a near-paraphrase loop ("final grain slipping through the narrow waist after the final grain slips"). These artifacts are minor and do not touch closure but slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally veers into overwriting, with some synonymous phrasing ("shrouded in a perpetual mist," "foggy lucidity") and a cluster of abstract nouns in peak beats ("dimensional harmonics," "conceptual repricing"). These minor artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor overwriting. Phrases like "charred dreams" and "Sisyphean task" feel slightly clichéd, and the rhythm can become heavy with stacked modifiers. However, no loops or artifacts obscure closure, and information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and atmospheric with high information density. However, it flirts with overwriting; phrases like "serenely electric" and "fantasy practicality" are evocative but risk abstraction. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final paragraph's rhythm effectively creates closure, though a few clauses could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("sense of wonder and trepidation," "mix of excitement and trepidation") and a register drift in the final paragraphs ("permanent transient-ness"), which slightly dull the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative clutter appears in the climax ("erupted into a riot of color and light"), slightly muddying the clarity of the closure image without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards synonymous phrasing ("seismic shift," "expanded exponentially") and some declarative summary that slightly dulls momentum. However, these do not obscure causality or the closure image, and the final paragraphs achieve a effective cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but minor artifacts include repetitive stems ("reeling hush" appears twice) and a slight over-reliance on atmospheric adjectives ("mystical," "otherworldly") in peak beats. Momentum remains strong, and closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in some sentences and a slight over-reliance on summary in the middle section (e.g., detailing the logbook's contents). These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "heartbeats counted on, a steady metronome") and a soft paraphrase loop between "midnight solace" and "sense of peace."

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. While figurative language is dense, it is pattern-taught and serves the textural drive of the story, avoiding muddle. A minor instance of paraphrasing occurs ("translating texture into sound" / "translate the texture of these shadows... into sound"), but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("strange and wondrous journey") and the slightly forced phrase "gravitationally playful." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher band. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. Minor instances of slightly ornamental phrasing ("blossoming dreams," "tarnished wonder") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("reawakened to its beauty" / "brought a tarnished wonder back") prevent a higher score, though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A slight scaffold artifact exists in the phrase "the mailman's task, however, was not to marvel... but to deliver," which slightly stalls momentum. However, this is minor and does not touch the closure beat. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. There is a minor instance of potential scaffold in "misting hush" being used three times, but it functions as a purposeful motif. The closing paragraphs are particularly strong, with clear propulsion and no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a paraphrase loop: "countless hours she'd spent" appears twice in close proximity, creating a small scaffold artifact that slightly reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, but risks overwriting. Figurative language is dense ("luminous absence," "cipher of longing") and occasionally repetitive, creating a slight rhythmic monotony that softens the closure's impact. No major artifacts, but the density is a minor liability.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, but risks density in the climax with phrases like "improbable longing" and "surge of improbable longing," creating a minor figurative stack in a high-pressure beat that slightly dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor artifacts include the slightly cliché "morbidly beautiful perfume" and the repetitive use of the phrase "crisp nostalgia," which creates a small loop and prevents a score above 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with a strong, varied rhythm that supports the atmospheric pressure. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats, such as "a complex web of emotions and experiences, a topography of the soul," which slightly blurs sense with abstraction. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is lush but suffers from overwriting: figurative language is pervasive ("shimmering veil," "celestial map"), leading to synonym churn and a loss of propulsion. Template cadence appears ("As she worked...", "As the seed took root..."). While beautiful, the density obscures clarity and momentum, particularly in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with good rhythm, though minor repetitive phrasing ("accumulated silence") appears. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. No major figurative muddles or scaffolding issues, but a slight template cadence in describing silence prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Sentences are purposeful and advance atmosphere and character. Information density is high. A single minor artifact: the phrase "methodically curious" feels slightly label-like upon its introduction, though the trait is demonstrated thereafter. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "sophisticated sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's likely lexicon in a moment of peak emotion. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "a tinkersong wonder that would linger"). No loops or scaffold artifacts, but a slight density of figurative language slightly mutes clarity at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight figurative density in the final paragraphs ("distilled into a poignant beauty," "glow with a soft, gentle light") which, while purposeful, slightly softens the clarity of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting is present, including a template cadence with repeated "As she..." sentence stems and a near-paraphrase loop between "spooled wholeness" and "fragments... coming together." This slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "fractally precise renderings" risks ornamentation). Figurative language ("mirror the sky") is coherent and supports closure. No significant loops or artifacts harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Rhythm varies naturally, breathing with the scene's calm intensity. A minor, hairline slip: the phrase "sociable isolation" leans slightly abstract for the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for slightly high figurative density in places (e.g., "driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright glow") which, while beautiful, occasionally borders on ornamentation that slightly slows momentum rather than advancing it with maximum efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight overuse of compound sentences and some abstract phrasing ("brambled hope," "strangely trustworthy nature") that, while purposeful, edges toward telling. The closure image, however, is clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. A minor -0.4 deduction for a template cadence run ("The hush that surrounded them...", "It was across this hush...") and slightly overripe diction ("bruised awe") in a peak beat, which slightly dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor template cadence emerges in a few sentences starting with "The caretaker..." or "She...", and a slight paraphrase loop occurs with "sense of connection" and "sense of determination." These are minor artifacts that do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear and concise with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor scaffold artifact exists: the phrase "the pieces began to fall into place" is a common template. However, this does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, it occasionally veers into slight overwriting ("mindfully scattered among the tomes") and uses soft, hedging language ("seemed," "appeared to") that slightly dulls the clarity and conviction of key beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly decorative phrasing ("stars were beginning to twinkle") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("smooth out the edges that had made them so painful" rephrases the core motivation). These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely lucid and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifactual issues include a paraphrase loop ("sense of timelessness it embodied" / "sense of kinship with it") and the slightly cliché "twinkled like diamonds," which slightly dull the closure image's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor paraphrase loop exists ("uncover the secrets" appears in consecutive paragraphs near the end), and some figurative language ("quaking reverie") feels slightly decorative rather than fully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly cliché "latent blaze" and a tendency towards summary in the final paragraphs ("she felt the weight of her discovery"), which slightly dull the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong and purposeful, but minor artifacts appear, including a slight paraphrase loop ("the music continued to flow" / "as the last notes faded away") and a register drift in "symphonically minded" which feels slightly academic for the POV's internal lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("silence was almost palpable, a living entity") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("The world was full of mysteries" appears twice).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but density of figurative language ("theatrical sincerity," "woven anew") in peak beats risks ornamentation and creates minor register drift. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush, precise, and purposeful, with high information density. There is minor overwriting in phrases like "the undercurrent of wisdom" which is repeated, and "wildflower hush" which, while beautiful, feels slightly decorative. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, maintaining momentum through its accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("whirling silence") is effective and consistent. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the pool's effect, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere effectively. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the investigative pace. A minor instance of near-synonym use ("converge in a singular convergence") is a slight artifact but does not harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is pervasive, nearing overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "unfetter the sculpted hush that lay dormant within the marble awaiting the sculptor's chisel"). This creates minor density issues that slightly obscure clarity without serving a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts include a repetitive stem in "the silence around her avalanchingly quiet" and "the avalanchingly quiet stillness," and a slight thesaurus-churn feel to "avalanchingly." These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight mixed metaphor ("swirling vortex" and "kaleidoscope" in close succession) and the label "lucid turbulence," which feels more declared than earned. These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. Deductions for minor overwriting: a stacked metaphor ("woven from the threads of memory and myth") and a slight paraphrase loop describing the pendant's effect on the locals and community. Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, purposeful, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("unvarnished and unfiltered") and a slightly abstract peak beat prevent a perfect score, but clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a tendency towards slightly ornate phrasing ("stoically sparkling thread," "melancholic reverie") and a paraphrase loop near the beginning describing the silence as both "impenetrable" and a "raveling silence." These are minor and do not obscure closure, but they slightly dilute the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "azure defiance," which is slightly contradictory and strains coherence, preventing a higher score despite otherwise clean line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing appear ("her senses reeling," used twice), creating slight repetition. The figurative language is mostly effective, though a few phrases ("kaleidoscope of images") edge toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with high information density. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in phrases like "luminescent ache" and the near-paraphrase between "deep and abiding sorrow" and "luminescent ache," which creates a small loop in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly controlled with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on light/shadow imagery in some beats and a few near-synonym phrases ("coalescing into a new reality"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong sensory detail and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly elevated diction ("valley-mist wonder," "iridescent caution") that occasionally feels decorative rather than fully integrated into the POV's voice. The closure image remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and propulsive, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is strong and varies naturally. A minor artifact is the phrase "mundane miracles," which borders on thematic echo and slightly disrupts the accumulative texture. Otherwise, clarity and concision are excellent, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor issues include a tendency towards slightly abstract language (e.g., "ethereal energy") and the repetitive use of "woven dawns" which, while thematic, edges towards a template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a cluster of filter verbs ("Elys felt," "Elys knew") and a slightly elevated register in the peak realization beat that slightly clashes with the established contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously, as in the description of the tea house's organic structure. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in some figurative clusters (e.g., "whispers of a forgotten lullaby") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative, but minor artifacts detract. "Comforting unease" is an effective oxymoron, but "heart quickened" is used twice. A slight paraphrase loop occurs with "determined" describing both father and daughter. The rhythm maintains good momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm, though it occasionally leans into decorative phrasing ("ethereal glow," "spectral light") that slightly inflates texture without advancing pressure. No major artifacts, but minor density issues prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts include near-duplicates ("inescapable callings" repeated) and a slightly over-written peak ("auroral sorrow," "otherworldly energy") that dulls clarity. No major loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is elegant and generally propulsive, with high information density. Minor instances of slightly elevated diction ("poignant reminder," "transience and beauty") create small register drifts in peak beats, slightly dulling the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("symphonies of truth," "glisten") and a tendency toward abstraction that creates a slight momentum drag. While purposeful for the tone, the pattern of synonym-like repetition ("muted vigor," "seasonally mute") acts as a minor text artifact, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "miniaturize the chaos" feels conceptually strained). A few synonym loops ("fragmented wholeness" repeated) and a clunky metaphor slightly obscure clarity at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, efficiently advancing character and plot. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "sandstorm calm" is a slightly strained metaphor that doesn't fully cohere with the established tone, but it's a isolated slip.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for some repetitive phrasing ("sense of...") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "gleaming silence" is used twice, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts include the slightly redundant pairing "tranquil atmosphere that seemed to smooth the hush" and the awkward compound "terrestrially cosmic." These create small drags on momentum but do not muddy the core action or obscure the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "words flowing like a river") and a template cadence in a few sentences, which slightly dull the immediacy without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. However, a repetitive phrasing artifact is present: "whispering seashell" appears ten times, creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. The phrase "through resonance structures" is a register drift that clashes with the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("utterly distinct" used twice) and occasional register drift into summary ("a sense of peace wash over her"). These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher band score.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward decorative figurative language creates minor density issues in high-pressure beats, such as the stacked metaphors in "webs of intrigue that crisscrossed the nexus begin to vibrate, like the threads of a spider's web in the morning dew." This slightly muzzles the clarity of propulsion without fundamentally obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A slight template cadence emerges in a few consecutive sentences starting with "Aria's..." or "The...", but this is a minor artifact that does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("scintillatingly somber") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("hidden patterns" is reiterated without added pressure). Clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear and propulsive, with good information density. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("Aria's curiosity was piqued, and she became more determined than ever to find the diamond" – a slight paraphrase loop). Figurative language is consistent and does not muddy clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor scaffold appears in repetitive sentence stems ("The visionary knew," "As she...") and a tendency toward summary. These artifacts do not obscure closure but slightly dull the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a minor deduction for a pattern of stacked modifiers and slightly overripe metaphors ("like a hesitant lover") that, while beautiful, occasionally verge on decorative rather than propulsive. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally lucid with strong rhythm and sensory density. However, "fleshly ethereal atmosphere" is a mixed metaphor that muddles clarity at a peak beat. Otherwise, minimal scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor scaffold is present in a few adjacent sentences ("The mapper knew... The mapper felt...") but does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor deductions for some repetitive phrasing ("watchfully calm" appears twice, "entangled memories/untangle" is repeated) and a filter verb stack in "Maya felt a surge of determination," which slightly dulls immediacy. No major artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacting appears, such as the slightly cliché "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" metaphor and a tendency toward elevated diction ("poignant reminder," "vibrant hush") that occasionally feels imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and sensory detail. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. Minor deductions for a few instances of near-synonym phrasing ("intricate mechanisms," "intricate web") and a slight over-reliance on "wonder" and "awe."

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences effectively advance atmosphere and character. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn around "absence" and "void" in the final paragraphs, and the phrase "digital detritus" feels slightly academic, though not enough to seriously harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("whispers of the frozen sea") and a near-paraphrase loop between "mapping empathy onto action" and "shifting landscapes of the heart," but these do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive with vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("serene," "solace," "peace") and a register drift in "a fold in patience," which feels more conceptual than embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of near-synonym churn ("deep and abiding truth") and a slightly elevated register in the final paragraphs prevent a higher score, though clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally concise and atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor thesaurus-itis is evident in the clustered use of "consecrate," "conjured," "manifestation," and "resonate" within a short span, creating a slight pattern artifact that dulls the peak beat's clarity without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with effective rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on the "sweet scent" and "sense of peace" motifs, creating a gentle paraphrase loop. The description "earnest whimsy" risks register drift but is isolated and does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and atmospheric with high information density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("sonically reflective," "red-rimmed") and a paraphrasing moment describing the method as "unorthodox, to say the least" which slightly scaffolds the prior description.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with virtually no scaffolding or loops. Sentence-level rhythm expertly supports the contemplative atmosphere. A minor instance of potential register drift ("a palpable entity") is slight, voice-motivated, and does not harm clarity. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clear and functional, with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a repetitive phrasing loop around "clock hand" and some abstract language ("luminous ache," "changelessly constant") that, while thematic, slightly dulls the concrete immediacy of peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor issues include a slight overuse of the word "soft" and some near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "gentle touch," "gentle choirs," "gentle cadence"). However, these do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum, and the closure beat remains clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("secrets of the cosmos," "mysteries of the universe") and a decorative phrase ("stars twinkled like diamonds") that slightly dulls the closure's charge without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("sense of purpose begin to take shape" / "sense of purpose and direction") and some elevated diction ("groundbreaking") that feels slightly out of step with the voice. No major obscurities.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lush and rhythmic, effectively building atmosphere. However, a tendency toward synonym churn ("soft luminescence," "gentle warmth," "soft, ethereal glow") and slightly stacked modifiers creates minor density without always advancing sense. The rhythm is purposeful, but the figurative language occasionally flirts with redundancy rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on the "honeyed hush" phrase and some near-paraphrase in the final paragraph ("a little lighter, a little freer"). These are minor artifacts that do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor synonym churn ("swirling hush of words") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely lush and purposeful, advancing atmosphere and story. Minor deductions for occasional thesaurus-churn ("verdant arbor," "ethereal light") and a template cadence in lists of Elara's traits ("whimsical tinkerer," "ingenious creations") that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and clarity. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat (e.g., "a power that resonated deeply with her own heartbeat" feels slightly redundant after the previous line). The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but minor artifacts exist. A paraphrase loop occurs with "wonder" ("wonder of it all," "store this wonder," "wonder of this place"). There is also a slight over-reliance on soft-focus adjectives ("soft," "faint," "gentle") that, while tonally consistent, slightly blunts sensory specificity in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple duties of advancing action, character, and atmosphere. Minor deductions for occasional moments where figurative language flirts with opacity ("whalebone reverie") and a tendency towards abstraction in peak beats, but clarity is never truly lost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lucid, precise, and possesses a read-aloud quality with varied syntax. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold to detract from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Minor deductions for a slight register drift in phrases like "negotiate with their own ghost," which edges toward abstraction, and a few near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "reconcile the eroded ambitions" echoed later). However, these do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in a run of sentences starting with "Maya" or "The" and a paraphrase loop near the end ("a sense of wonder, a sense of awe"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm, but suffers from minor repetition ("excruciatingly gentle" appears twice, "petrichor nostalgia" reappears). Some near-synonym churn ("soundless sanctuary," "glacial hush") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns ("upheaval," "clarity") in peak beats and a paraphrasing loop near the end ("serene upheaval" repeated). Information density is high, and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lucid and atmospheric with strong momentum. Minor artifacts include a template cadence run ("The collector's eyes narrowed... Her mind working...") and a cluster of filter verbs in the fulgurite glass paragraph, which slightly dull immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor line-level artifacts. A paraphrase loop occurs ("a sense of understanding wash over me, a comprehension"), and a filter verb stack ("I began to ponder," "I felt compelled," "I hoped to conjure") clusters in a key beat, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting occurs ("bitterly sweet nostalgia," "quaking reverie"), using slightly decorative phrasing that softens the peak beats. The final paragraph's density is effective but borders on summary, slightly dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sensory selection. A minor deduction for a template cadence in the final paragraphs ("She stood there...", "As the night wore on...") and a slight over-reliance on "sense of" constructions, which marginally dilute the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting risks appear ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but do not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is maintained, though some phrases lean slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, with high information density. However, minor scaffold issues emerge, including near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "intricate patterns" repeated) and a tendency toward elevated diction that occasionally flirts with ornamentation. These artifacts do not obscure closure but slightly dull momentum in mid-passages.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The sun's final rays dissolved into the ancient greenhouse's misty veil"). Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop exists ("a sense of peace" is used twice near the ghost's appearance), but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density, varied syntax, and a compelling read-aloud rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving character and atmosphere. A minor instance of synonym churn ("incremental absolution" / "incremental process of healing") appears but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of potential register drift exists in "velveteen gloom," which feels slightly ornamental, but it is a single phrase that does not harm clarity or momentum. Information density is high and propulsion is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often beautiful and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting is present (e.g., "groundedly imaginative intensity," "sustaining transformation"), employing slightly elevated diction that feels repetitive and abstracts the core concept. This creates a mild textural artifact but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifact: the phrase "thistled calm" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. However, this is a purposeful lyric reprise that supports the tone and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, accomplishing multiple jobs (e.g., "shattered porcelain shards" conveys object, texture, and theme). Sentence-level propulsion is strong, varying rhythm to match emotional beats. A minor instance of near-synonym churn ("sense of longing," "deeper understanding," "poignant reminder") in the final paragraphs prevents a 9+ score, though closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("rationally rebellious" appears three times) and a paraphrasing loop between "competing narratives" and "official story... truth." These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("sense of longing, a yearning") and the slightly precious compound phrase "traveled stillness," which dulls immediacy without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, effectively building an accumulative rhythm. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing ("a testament to forgotten dreams") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats prevent a higher score, though clarity is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on summary in the final paragraphs ("The memory... would stay with them") and a near-paraphrase loop between "revealed the truth" and "truth revealed." However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythm. Minor artifacts appear, including a paraphrase loop ("sense of quiet wonder" / "inexplicable connection to its inadvertently profound presence") and a tendency toward slightly abstract nouns in key moments ("profound discovery," "heightened awareness"), which slightly dull the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong sensory imagery. However, a pattern of repetitive sentence stems emerges (e.g., "The statue..." opens multiple paragraphs), creating a template cadence that slightly dulls momentum. The figurative language is largely effective, though the phrase "cascading revelations" is stated explicitly rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including a slight synonym churn ("boundless confinement," "endless steps") and a template cadence in a few sentences starting with "The dice...". These do not significantly harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "saffron quiet") which creates a minor artifact, but it does not obscure closure or causality. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("weight...settling upon them like a mantle") and the phrase "rosewater dread" feels slightly overwritten and tonally jarring for the otherwise measured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("neatly inventive mind" used twice) and some filter verbs ("felt," "knew"). These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Rhythm and clarity are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor overwriting and a template cadence in places (e.g., "The whispering advisor's voice..." is a repetitive stem). These artifacts are present but do not critically obscure the closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor tendency toward synonymous phrasing ("restless energy," "restless euphony") and a slightly over-stacked metaphor ("a tiny, shining jewel") prevent a higher score, but clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with strong information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively. There is a minor rhythmic stumble in the phrase "driven by her quietly driven nature," which creates a slight semantic loop. However, this is a isolated issue and does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in early atmospheric descriptions. A few mixed metaphors ("skeletal fingers," "pit of lies") slightly muddle clarity without major harm to momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the phrase "hushed blaze" feels slightly contrived and the description "interlaced absence" edges toward thematic echo. These are small blemishes in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor scaffold and synonym churn, particularly the repetitive use of "sense of" phrases. Rhythm is effective, though some sentences are overly complex, slightly muddying clarity in high-density beats. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, but slight overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats (e.g., "luminous torment that drove him to create, to shape, and to mold."). A minor deduction for figurative density that slightly blurs momentum, though clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory detail. The phrase "intangibly tangible" is repeated, creating a minor synonym loop. A few clunky phrases ("an intangibly tangible essence") slightly disrupt the rhythm, but these artifacts do not materially harm closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive. Deduction applied for moderate overwriting: a pattern of dense figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "stars beginning to twinkle like diamonds") creates minor texture without advancing pressure or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats and a few filter verbs. The closure beat, however, remains clear and propulsive, with no major loops or scaffold obscuring the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on the "mist swirling" motif creates a template cadence, and phrases like "recycle their mistakes into wisdom" edge toward therapy-speak, though they are quickly anchored back in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on the "as he [verbed]" construction and the phrase "merrily melancholic" feeling slightly label-like upon its reprise. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong atmospheric description. However, minor artifacts are present, including a slight synonym churn ("ethereal glow," "otherworldly light," "inner light") and a template cadence in sentences starting with "Lena felt" or "As she...". These do not severely harm clarity but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm, though occasional overwriting occurs ("cosmic harmony," "electric anticipation"). A minor synonym loop appears ("reluctant metamorphosis" then "dramatic turn"). No artifacts obscure closure; the final paragraph lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though a minor deduction for the slightly overripe "choking beauty" phrase, which borders on decorative in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing occur ("a deep sense of resolve," "a mix of emotions"), and a slight register drift in peak beats prevents a higher score, though clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("the texture of transformation begin to reveal itself") and a template cadence in lists (e.g., "the sound of the waves and the volcano"). These are minor artifacts that do not seriously obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and functional but is hampered by repetitive phrasing and synonym churn (e.g., "silent revolution" appears three times, "calmly inventive" is repeated). This creates a template cadence that dulls momentum and slightly obscures the closure image, though the core causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lush and purposeful, but it trends toward overwriting in high-pressure beats, with a density of figurative language that can obscure immediacy (e.g., "the borrowed dawn tone of the sky – a fleeting moment of beauty borrowed from the night"). This creates minor momentum drag without a clear pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for occasional dense figurative clusters ("maddening vortex of sound and sense") that slightly slow momentum in high-pressure beats, but clarity and propulsion are largely maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is elegant and generally concise, with good rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the significance of the sewing card, creating a slight paraphrase loop that reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Generally strong, purposeful prose with good rhythm. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on "the poet" as a sentence stem and some near-paraphrasing (e.g., "sense of purpose" / "newfound sense of purpose"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "like fireflies on a summer's night") which slightly dilutes density in a few spots, but it does not obscure causality or the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include slight redundancy ("vibrant landscape in bloom" followed by "blooming flowers") and the somewhat abstract phrasing of "luminous glow that seemed to embody the doubt," which slightly dulls immediacy at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with high information density. However, a template cadence emerges in a cluster of sentences starting with "He" or "Kaito" in the middle third, and the phrase "rhythmically placid" is repeated, creating a minor text artifact that slightly disrupts momentum.


== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and consistent, but conceptual repetition (“gradual change,” “preprocesses”) yields minor loops. Sentences often tell rather than compress multiple jobs via image. Line rhythm is steady to a fault, reducing propulsion. No major figurative muddle, just over‑articulation of thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level craft is clean and mostly grammatical, but paraphrase loops and abstractions reduce density and propulsion. Repetitions (“scorched testament,” “patterns,” “stillness”) recur without new torque, and modifiers sometimes veer purple. Momentum stalls in places due to summary‑like sentences. The final image is clear, though not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean, fluent lines with purposeful imagery and few hedges. Minor repetition and a couple of familiar constructions (“like ripples on a pond,” “symphony of silence”) soften freshness but don’t stall momentum. Information density is good; sentences often carry double duty (atmosphere and action). Cadence supports the accumulative lens without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean, comprehensible lines with occasional evocative phrasing. However, paraphrase/repetition loops and motif reiteration blunt momentum (e.g., repeated “stillness” and “rest” claims). Figurative density is restrained, but the final third leans declarative rather than image-driven. Tighter cuts and varied rhythm would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clear with occasional pleasing images (“distant clang of a pot being washed”). Some redundancy and template phrasing (“as she…”, repeated constructions) reduce density and momentum. Figurative language is restrained, avoiding muddle, but the line-by-line work seldom carries double duty. Overall polished but not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean and readable, but purple tendencies and synonym loops (“ethereal,” “otherworldly,” “glow,” “twilight”) soften impact. Several sentences restate similar sentiments about atmosphere and peace. Information density is moderate; momentum dips in reflective recaps. The closing image is lucid despite the ornamental layering.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level craft is lush and rhythmic, yet leans on repeated abstractions (“fabric of time/reality,” “essence,” “mysteries”) and paraphrase-like reinforcement. Information density is decent, but figuration sometimes piles without adding pressure. Momentum sags in explanatory lines that restate the premise. Clean mechanics and syntax prevent confusion, but the prose over‑tells at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Readable lines with some vivid images, but repetition and scaffolded phrasing recur (“the liberator…”) and several near‑duplicate sentiments reduce density. Abstract intensifiers (“staggering grace,” “beacon of hope”) replace concrete beats at the peak. Momentum sags as achievements are summarized rather than dramatized. Minor purple touches don’t obscure sense but dilute charge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are clean and rhythmic with vivid, sensate phrasing. Some repetition and paraphrase loops (“battered marvel,” “cells dividing,” aurora/forge re-mentions) dilute momentum. A few generalized statements reduce density near the end. Figurative logic holds, and syntax varies enough to carry the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line‑level craft shows redundancy and synonym loops (reiterated moonlight/ethereal/golden themes) that slow momentum. Figurative density is high without proportional escalation, blurring emphasis. Many sentences restate the same wonder, yielding a decorative glaze over propulsion. Syntax varies minimally, creating a steady, unpressured drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level craft is generally clean and rhythmic, with effective sensory layering. However, purple tilts and redundancy (“thawing heart,” cracked leather emphasis) create mild momentum drag. Some sentences paraphrase sentiment rather than advance it, and intensifiers outpace pressure. The final image lands but could be sharper with cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean mechanics with some redundancy and generic phrasing (“I felt a sense of purpose,” “I was ready to face whatever lay ahead”). Figurative language is sparse and safe; a few paraphrase loops slow momentum. The “smudged note” beat is summarized rather than dramatized, leaking energy. No major artifacts, but information density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are clean and mostly purposeful, but figurative density is high and sometimes redundant (“hush,” “silence,” “darkness” recur with near-synonymous modifiers). Some paraphrase echoes and intensifier stacking slow momentum. Still, syntax varies, images are largely coherent, and the final cadence lands. Minimal scaffolding; a trim could heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean sentences and few mechanical errors, but paraphrase loops and scaffolded statements recur (“remarkably composed,” “second chance program,” “frozen courtyard at twilight”). Many lines tell what the prior line implied, slowing momentum. Figurative density is restrained, yet the cadence is monotonous. The closure image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level compression.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level craft shows fluency, yet repetition (“resonant hush,” “mistrust and secrecy melted away,” “freed by honesty”) creates paraphrase loops and softens impact. Figurative density occasionally turns purple without adding new information. Momentum is slowed by restated insights rather than layered detail. Clarity is fine, but cuts could heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean sentences and purposeful imagery carry momentum, but redundancy appears in restated ideas and recycled stems. Abstract phrases (“mended deception,” “measurable luck”) are intriguing yet under‑specified, adding slight haze. Overall, density is respectable and the final line lands clearly. Trim loops to sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Readable and clear, but padded by repetition and purple flourishes (“ethereal glow,” “kaleidoscope of colors”), with paraphrase echoes of awe and energy. Figurative density sometimes stacks without adding new information, softening momentum. Minimal scaffolding overall; grammar and sequencing are clean. The final image lands but could be sharper with leaner lines.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is clear but repeats motifs and phrasing, creating paraphrase loops and soft redundancy. Abstract feeling statements (“she felt a surge of inspiration,” “a sense of peace”) reduce information density at peak beats. Imagery is serviceable yet occasionally generic, with limited syntactic variety. The prose propels gently but lacks the compression and precision needed at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, fluent lines with purposeful imagery and a steady music. Some paraphrase and conceptual redundancy (“truth… provisional and ephemeral”) and occasional abstractions blunt momentum. Figurative language remains coherent, though it leans ornamental at times. Information density is solid, if not cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and readable flow, but there’s paraphrase looping and stock phrasing (e.g., repeated “The explorer…,” “felt a sense of…”). Figurative and sensory lines do work, yet momentum sags where summary repeats prior content. The final third repeats the valve‑wheel clutching without adding pressure. Overall concise but not maximally efficient or texturally varied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean syntax and evocative phrasing, but paraphrase loops and near-duplicate sentiments recur (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “crumbling peace,” “regenerative silence”). Information density dips as lines restate mood rather than advance pressure. Imagery is clear without metaphor muddle, yet momentum drags. Final third repeats motifs, dulling the closure image’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Readable, rhythmic prose with vivid moments, but noticeable redundancy and abstraction (frequent “as” clauses, restated premises) slow momentum. Occasional telliness and generic formulations (“ordinary magic,” “softly adaptive”) lessen line-by-line charge. Figurative language stays coherent but risks purple edges. Tightening would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and sensory detail carry momentum, but repetition (“bronze quiet,” “whispers,” “dust”) and paraphrase loops reduce density. Figurative language remains coherent, yet several lines restate the same state rather than advancing it. The final third is readable but soft from redundancy. Cutting duplicative phrasing would sharpen the close.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.0)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops are frequent (“direct the flow,” “transpose,” “open secrets,” “mysterious lighthouse”), reducing momentum. Figurative language is generic and reused rather than sharpened; information density suffers. Many sentences restate stakes without adding pressure or image, dulling the closure cadence. The final third reiterates earlier claims rather than crystallizing them in action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level repetition and paraphrase loops recur (“silence as presence,” “underlying truths,” “whispers of the unknown”), reducing momentum. Figurative language leans generic and often restates rather than layers new information. Sentences are clean but carry padding; escalation passages rely on intensifiers. The final image is clear, yet verbal redundancy blunts its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line‑level craft is competent and musical, but repetition and abstraction (“testament,” “beauty,” “magic,” “silence”) create mild synonym loops. Figurative density is high with limited variation, occasionally veering into purple and dulling momentum. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea (reflection/symmetry/inspiration) without added pressure. Clarity holds, yet propulsion and economy could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clean sentences and imagery, but repetition and paraphrase loops (“glow,” “labyrinth,” “fractured timelines”) dilute momentum. Abstract phrasing often substitutes for specific action; intensifiers replace concrete turns. Some purple tilt (“periodically eternal existence,” “darkening brightness”) lacks fresh vehicle grounding. Propulsion lags in the midsection where summary outweighs scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is lush and often effective, but phrase loops and synonym churn recur (“faint rustle of turning seasons,” “mirrored hush,” “enthrall”), sapping momentum. Occasional purple generalities replace action in crucial moments. The final third repeats motifs rather than sharpening them, dulling the closure image. Line-level density could be cut and focused for greater charge.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean, mostly clear prose with pleasant sensory lines, but redundancy and small errors drag (“poured” for “pored,” repeated “message tube still clutched in her hand”). Several sentences rephrase the same state (tranquility and resolve) without adding pressure. Elevated abstractions occasionally replace concrete action. Momentum softens in the midsection.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.6)
    Frequent paraphrase and motif reiteration create drag (multiple near‑identical sentences about UV patterns and the vial’s glow). Purple tendencies and scaffold phrasing dilute impact. Line‑level density could be halved for greater propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line‑level craft is clean and sensorial, but paraphrase loops and template stems dilute momentum. Recurrent structures (“As she…,” “The world… a canvas…”) and abstract reiterations blur edge. Figurative language is mostly coherent but trends toward redundancy. The final third continues patterns rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are clean and often musical, with strong sensory verbs and concrete images. However, there’s mild paraphrase looping and motif overuse (“chronic hush” reiterated) that could be cut for density. Figurative language stays coherent, if occasionally purple. Momentum holds, with only minor redundancy drag.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and imagistic, with purposeful sensory layering. There is some paraphrase and scaffold repetition (“As…”/“The dealer…”/“The grotto…”) that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid muddle, but line-by-line propulsion is modest. The final lines land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean, fluent sentences with a few textured images; minimal errors. Repetition of abstract phrasing (“cycles of compassion,” “kindled,” “blossomed”) creates a mild echo and summary feel. Momentum softens under exposition near the end. Figurative choices are safe and coherent, if not highly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean grammar and clear sequencing, but paraphrase loops (“webs of kinship,” “luminescent ache,” belonging) reduce density. Figurative language trends purple without escalating insight in later beats. Many sentences do single duty (telling theme) rather than layering action, image, and implication. Momentum softens under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is often graceful and image‑rich, but repetition of motifs (cadence, rhythm, echoes) creates mild redundancy. The conspicuous syntax error and occasional purple phrasing dull precision. Momentum droops in explanatory sentences about legends and calculations that could be rendered with sharper economy. Line‑level craft is solid but not razor‑clean.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and imagistic clarity carry the scene, but redundancy and paraphrase loops recur (“The conjurer…” openings; restated aims and discoveries). Abstract phrasing and modest purple creep (“hidden harmonies,” “realm of possibility”) flatten impact. Rhythm stays mid‑tempo without strategic compression/expansion to propel the climax. Tightening and cutting duplicative lines would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is clean, with purposeful imagery and concrete verbs; sensory specificity often does double duty. Minor redundancies and favored phrases (“sapphire hush,” “hidden”) recur, risking slight purple tint but not muddling clarity. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density. No major scaffold or metaphor collisions.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“mossy trellis,” “storm season,” “transformation”) sap momentum. Abstractions substitute for scene pressure, and several sentences restate the same idea without added texture or cost. Figurative language is safe rather than fresh, and information density is modest. The final third continues the loops, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences and clarity are strengths, but repetition and scaffolding appear (“haggard awe” twice; several lines paraphrase earlier claims). Figurative choices tend toward cliché, and exposition crowds scene energy. Momentum dips in summary passages that could carry conflict in scene. Rhythm is even, rarely accelerating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences and competent rhythm, but paraphrase loops and abstraction (“unseen forces,” “vibrations,” “bright darkness”) recur without new information. Figurative density is steady and occasionally purple, softening propulsion. Information density is moderate; several lines tell what images already imply. The final paragraph leans into explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean, grammatical lines with steady cadence; few mechanical errors. Some paraphrase and conceptual repetition (“beacon,” “remembrance,” “fragments”) dull momentum. Telling dominates pivotal beats, limiting density and propulsion. Imagery is competent but rarely surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level repetition (“the mist,” “trembling certainty,” declarative summaries) creates scaffolding and slows momentum. Figurative density is mild but leans purple without sharpening stakes. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar content, dulling propulsion. Final beats rely on telling rather than image‑driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.6)
    Readable, with some vivid images, yet the prose leans on repeated abstractions and recycled phrases (“unheard symphony,” “fabric,” “tapestry,” “alchemy”). Paraphrase loops and intensifiers appear without adding new pressure. Figurative density occasionally blurs specificity. Momentum is steady but not sharply honed.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with steady momentum, though it leans on repetitive syntactic stems and conceptual phrasing (“the colors…,” “the energy…”) across adjacent lines. Figurative language is controlled and not contradictory; no major purple flares obscure causality. Redundancies (“As the storm…”, “With each passing moment…”) could be tightened for greater force. The final image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean sentences with sensory specificity; rhythm is generally smooth. Redundancies and near‑loops (“waited actively,” “mathematics of a fair trade,” multiple “seemed”) dilute force, and some metaphoric phrasing leans purple. Information density is acceptable but could cut scaffolding to sharpen momentum. Final image is clear but not linguistically surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is clean and often lovely, but paraphrase loops and formulaic openings (“The stationer’s… The air was… The pencil…”) reduce momentum. Figurative density sometimes feels decorative rather than load-bearing. The final third reiterates effects (“textures,” “essence”) without adding new pressure. Line-level craft is competent but not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and template stems depress momentum (“The survivor…,” “The labyrinth…,” “The tide…” recurring without added pressure). Abstract phrasing (“texture of memories”) substitutes for concrete action. Information density is low relative to repetition, especially in the final third. Clarity holds, but propulsion suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level craft leans into repetition and modifiers (“whispers of the past,” “gloomy cheerfulness”) that loop without adding pressure. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase prior content; the crescendo repeats with near‑synonyms. Figurative density is high but not always doing double duty, softening propulsion. The final third keeps clarity but carries these loops, dulling the peak image’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is clear but repetitive, with paraphrase loops (“As the graffiti spread…,” “As the threat… drew closer”) and summary scaffolding. Limited variance in syntax and a reliance on abstract nouns dull momentum. Few lines do double duty with image and implication. No major grammatical faults, but density is low.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line craft shows evocative moments, but repetition and paraphrase loops (“stillness… almost palpable,” “dawning hush” reappears) reduce density. Some modifiers blur rather than sharpen, and a few mixed or strained images sap momentum. The final image is clear though not razor‑cut. Overall readable but over‑embroidered.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean sentences and purposeful images carry momentum, with occasional paraphrase loops (“beacon of calm,” mist refrains) and mild purple lean. Information density is adequate; some lines do one job where two would sharpen. Rhythm is steady, perhaps too uniform for peak turns. Copy is clean with clear action order.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing, but paraphrase loops and familiar formulations (“silence palpable,” repeated crunching snow) sap momentum. Figurative density is moderate and sometimes generic; the “worrying tranquility” refrain does extra telling. The code‑cracking is summarized, missing a propulsive line‑level turn. Overall readable but not tight.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clean sentences and a steady cadence, but there’s paraphrase/reiteration (“The rhythm…,” “The pattern…”) that loops without new pressure. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, though some abstractions dilute impact. Information density is fair; a leaner pass could tighten momentum. Final image is clear despite minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft suffers from repetition and purple lean—phrases like “lonesome splendor,” “gathered hush,” and “as time runs short” recur without adding pressure. Sentences frequently restate content in near-synonym loops; cadence varies little. Imagery is clear but often generalized, diluting propulsion. Clean mechanics prevent deeper penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clear, rhythmic, and image-forward, but repetition and synonym loops reduce momentum. Figurative density sometimes outstrips action, and several metaphors are reiterated rather than evolved. The cadence risks sameness across beats and relies on similar sentence constructions. Still, the lines generally carry sense without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level craft is clear and serviceable, but redundancy and purple leanings (“ethereal light,” “bathed,” “otherworldly”) sap momentum. Several paraphrase loops and intensifier reiterations appear, especially around the awakening/fading beats. Information density is adequate, yet sentences often do one job where two were possible. The final image is intact, if familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are generally clean and musical, but paraphrase loops and formulaic reiterations (“path from ruin to reverence,” “power of art to transform”) dilute momentum. Figurative density is steady without egregious muddle, yet several modifiers feel purple. Information density is acceptable; more cut-to-the-nerve specificity would lift propulsion. Final image is clear despite the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are clean and readable, with sensory specificity and minimal errors. Some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“purposeful wandering,” “cautious enchantment”) recur without adding pressure. Figurative language stays coherent but leans familiar. Information density is adequate, not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line craft shows polish and clarity, but paraphrase loops and repetitious formulations (anticipation, journey, beauty of surface mail) sap momentum. Figurative texture leans purple at times without advancing pressure. Syntax varies modestly yet feels patterned. Grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level clarity holds, but paraphrase loops and template stems (“The embroiderer…,” “As…,” “They knew…”) slow momentum. Intensifiers (“otherworldly,” “just in time”) substitute for concrete turns, and some purple phrasing edges toward redundancy. Rhythm could vary more to reflect rising pressure. Clean mechanics, modest density.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly efficient, with good sensory layering. There’s some purple drift and repetition (“singing spirits,” “mist,” “unsent letters”) that creates mild loopiness and softens momentum. Figurative language holds together without mixed metaphors, and the final image is clean. Slight over-decoration in mid-beats dulls pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level repetition and abstract diction (“anxieties,” “graft new meaning,” “lotus-hearted ache”) dull momentum and specificity. Many sentences restate similar ideas, and cadence often defaults to parallel openers. Figurative language is consistent but veers purple in the final third, slightly blurring impact. Information density could be higher with tighter cuts and more concrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clean sentences and effective sensory detail carry momentum, though some lines paraphrase adjacent content and lean on familiar formulations. Figurative language is tasteful and not overstacked. Minor repetition and declarative scaffolding in reflective beats slightly dull sharpness. Ending image reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.6)
    Evocative lines and images carry momentum, but paraphrase loops and intensifiers recur (noise/color vortex described in similar terms). A noticeable copy slip (“had bewitch the mural”) breaks polish. Some purple phrasing blurs edges at peak beats. Tighter cutting and varied syntax would lift the line‑level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level craft is clean but padded by repetition (“beacon of resistance,” “spark of defiance,” legacy refrains) and summary loops. Figurative choices are safe and sometimes redundant, dampening momentum. Information density could be higher if exposition were dramatized in scene. Rhythm remains uniform, with few sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lines are clear and musical, but repetition and ornamentation slightly drag momentum (multiple restatements of the desire to transform pain; recurring set phrases). Figurative density is high with some redundancy; still, syntax is varied and readable. Minor pruning would tighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line‑level craft is clear but leans into repetition and ornamental phrasing (“deserted marvels,” “foxglove regret”) without always adding new pressure. Some paraphrase loops and redundant image restatements slow momentum. Figurative density is high in calm beats without a patterned payoff. The final third remains legible but could be tighter and less repetitious.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    Readable and occasionally musical, but repetition (“symphonies of truth,” “cautious exuberance”) and synonym loops soften momentum. Figurative density sometimes outpaces action, flirting with purple prose. Many sentences restate mood rather than advance situation. The final image is clear despite the ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and intensifier churn (“compassion and unity,” “as the building breathed,” repeated trembles and warmth). Figurative density often exceeds function, blurring momentum. Sentences are grammatical, but many do single duty and could be cut without loss. The final paragraphs reiterate rather than sharpen the image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentences are clean, sensory, and copy‑tight with only light scaffold. Some redundancy (“musty scent,” “soft cooing,” recurring dust phrasing) slows momentum and creates mild loops. Figurative language stays coherent but safe; propulsion is limited by summary lines. The final image is clear and unblurred by overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line craft is clean but padded: paraphrase loops (“necessary distances,” “sacred thresholds”) and reiterated insights slow momentum. Figurative density edges purple without layered payoff, and several sentences restate prior content. The final third repeats earlier claims instead of sharpening image or cost. Readability remains sound, but tightening would lift charge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.0)
    Repetition and paraphrase loops (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) reduce density and momentum. Figurative language often floats without fresh vehicles; lines do single duty and restate prior content. Syntax and cadence show sameness across paragraphs, flattening propulsion. The final third continues the summary tone, softening the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but paraphrase loops and stock-ish modifiers appear (“glow with an inner light,” repeated motifs). Several adjacent lines restate similar emotional states, softening propulsion. Purple-leaning phrases skirt excess without collapsing sense. Information density is adequate, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clean sentences and sensory balance, but paraphrase loops and abstract lexis (“calculated wilderness,” “strategic randomness”) dilute immediacy. Figurative loading is safe rather than incisive; few lines do more than one job. The final third reiterates rather than sharpens, muting closure. Overall clear, seldom propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is fluent with sensory density, but redundancy and purple inflections appear (“moonstone cabochon dust speck” repeats, several lines paraphrase prior claims). Some abstractions summarize effect where image could carry it. Cadence is pleasant yet occasionally uniform. Clean mechanics and a clear final image sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level control is competent, but paraphrase loops and abstraction churn (“hidden patterns,” “clear complexity,” “illuminate value”) recur without added pressure. Figurative language is safe and sometimes generic; moments verge on purple without crossing into incoherence. Information density could rise by cutting redundant statements of theme. Final beats repeat earlier sentiments rather than reframing them.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    Readable sentences, but paraphrase loops and stock phrases (“universal language,” “gentle glow,” “hard softness”) recur. Figurative density is mild yet unadventurous, and several lines restate without adding pressure. The mirror/box image does work, but momentum sags under redundancy. No major grammar or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and readable but leans into repetition of concepts and phrases (“trial balloons,” “grotto,” “patterns”) without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is safe and occasionally purple, with low information density in some lines. Momentum drifts during reiterated abstractions. Still, mechanics are sound and clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and template phrases (“It was said…,” “The estate, it seemed…”) reduce momentum and density. Figurative language is safe rather than fresh; several sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Syntax and rhythm remain uniform, dulling propulsion. Line-level economy could be sharply improved.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level craft shows rhythm but repeats structures and phrases, creating drag. Multiple sentences begin with “As…,” and adjacent lines paraphrase similar content (colors dancing, dusky harmony re‑stated). Figurative density is high with limited progression, veering into ornament. Clarity holds, but momentum softens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“ritual significance,” “slow dance,” “price of redemption”) reduce momentum. Figurative language trends purple and often restates rather than advances stakes. Sentences frequently tell instead of layering new information, blurring escalation. Rhythm is competent but sameness dulls the closure image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clean sentences with clear sequencing, but line‑level redundancy and paraphrase loops (“barren, cracked expanse”; repeated thesis phrases) slow momentum. Some abstract labels (“destructive power of greed”) substitute for image under peak stakes. The rhythm is pleasant yet uniform, dampening propulsion. Overall clarity holds, but density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clear and readable, but prone to redundancy and adjective stacking (“soft, ethereal light”; “alarming serenity”) and repeated scaffolds. Paraphrase loops summarize emotional states rather than embody them, and the “as she” cadence recurs. Figurative language rarely surprises at the line level. Momentum holds, yet density could be tightened considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean syntax and readable cadence, but paraphrase loops and scaffold recur (reiterations of serenity, mission, and hush). Figurative texture is pleasant yet sometimes generic, with limited multi-function lines. Momentum is adequate for a quiet scene but could be tightened with sharper, embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft offers pleasing images, yet repetition and purple-leaning abstractions (“otherworldly light,” “blushing stillness,” “testament”) dilute force. Several sentences restate the same idea, slowing momentum. Information density and propulsion are moderate; fewer modifiers and more concrete action would sharpen effect. The final third repeats “testament” and similar diction, dulling closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing, but noticeable redundancy and purple phrasing (“snowmelt ardor” repeats; several near‑duplicate lines assert purpose). Some scaffolding (“The process was painstaking… but Akira was undeterred”) tells what the next line shows. Figurative density is moderate and sometimes generic, blunting momentum. Tightening would increase charge.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean with occasional strong images, but redundancies and abstraction drag momentum (“The dreams were not just random firings...”). Figurative density sometimes becomes generic rather than scene‑specific. Syntax varies enough to remain readable, yet several paraphrase‑like statements could be cut for tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.6)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and cadence sameness (“As…” openings, cosmic abstractions) flatten momentum. Figurative language leans purple without sharpening action; many sentences restate expectancy and harmony. Clean mechanics, but density-to-advance ratio is low in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is readable but padded by repetition and abstract intensifiers (“soft, golden light,” “gentle reminder,” “shifting grace”). Several paraphrase loops restate the theme without adding pressure. Figurative language is safe/purple-adjacent and often interchangeable. Momentum sags where summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery is often striking and the line work largely clean. There are paraphrase loops and formulaic returns (“shimmer,” “erasing boundaries”) that create faint drumbeat monotony. Purple tendencies hover but do not obscure sense or closure. Momentum holds, though density could increase by trimming redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clear and grammatical, with a calm cadence suited to the mood. Redundancy and abstraction (reiterations of “deciduous,” generalized summaries of change) sap momentum. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent, though it sometimes states theme instead of letting images carry it. Line‑level propulsion is adequate but rarely propulsive or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear and serviceable with occasional luminous images (“blossoms shimmering like stardust”). Some redundancy and label phrases (“brightened disquiet,” “philosophical breakthrough”) flatten peak beats. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent; momentum holds. Minimal scaffolding remains but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lines are generally clean but rely on repeated abstractions and echoing phrases (“unheard symphony,” “carefully resourceful,” “labyrinthine”) that create mild loopiness. Figurative language trends purple in places without adding causal texture. Momentum softens due to summary and redundancy, yet grammar and clarity hold. Information density is moderate rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    Readable and largely clean, but paraphrase loops and scaffolding recur (“She knew that she had to…,” “As she…” repetition). Several sentences summarize interior shifts instead of embodying them, slowing momentum. Figurative language is safe and sometimes clichéd, with minimal syntactic variety at peak beats. The final image is clear but not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics, but noticeable scaffold and repetition (“merge,” “threads,” “clarity,” “fables”) reduce density and momentum. Several adjacent sentences restate similar content without adding pressure. Imagery is consistent but leans generic in peak beats; the final third’s abstractions dull impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing, but paraphrase loops and stock stems (“The mapkeeper…”) recur and thin momentum. Figurative language is controlled, yet repetition reduces density and propulsion. Some phrasing leans abstract rather than concrete embodiment in peak beats. The final cadence is gentle but not particularly compressed or surprising at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm is smooth, but redundancy and purple tilt creep in (“With the shard of hush still clutched in their hand” repeats; several “as they…” openings). Figurative language clusters without added pressure, diluting impact. Many sentences restate mood rather than add new information, softening propulsion. Line clarity holds, but density could be higher with fewer near‑duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences and evocative images, but repetition (“crystal whispering forecourt,” “collective memory”) and near‑duplicate sentiments blunt momentum. Occasional purple phrasing and summary declarations supplant scene pressure in key beats. Information density is decent, yet several lines could be cut without loss. Final image lands, though the line‑level music does not intensify it.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and near‑duplicate sentiments slow momentum (multiple lines restating calm chants, ambient sensing, and inspiration). Figurative texture is mild and safe; specificity sometimes gives way to generalities. Sentences do not always multitask, reducing density. The final image is clear but not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean sentences and imagery, but paraphrase loops and near‑duplicate assertions (“transition periods,” “texture of time,” “contemplative silence”) slow momentum. Figurative language is controlled yet occasionally generic (symbol named outright). Information density is moderate with some padding. The final image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level compression.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean and image‑forward with good cadence; minimal errors. Some redundancy and told summarization slightly dampen momentum in the final third. Figurative language is coherent and not overstacked. The final line ties motif without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line craft is clean and readable, but paraphrase loops and scaffold recur (“As she…” repetitions; restating mission and vial behavior). Figurative language trends purple without additional pressure, and several sentences duplicate function. Momentum sags in the middle due to near‑duplicate beats. The final image is clear, but accumulation could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lines are clear and largely clean, yet modifier density and repeated cadences (“she knew,” “as she…”) create mild purple overhang. Several phrases are stock (“sweet scent of blooming flowers,” “reached for the stars…brought low by hubris”), dulling freshness. Momentum holds, but scaffold-like reiterations of destiny and restoration could be trimmed for tautness. The final paragraph tells what the images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft shows rhythm and image, but repetition and abstraction (“loaded emptiness,” “teach suffocating to breathe”) recur without new pressure. Some sentences paraphrase prior content, softening momentum. Figurative density verges on purple in places, with limited concrete, embodied action. Clarity holds, but propulsion suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line‑level craft contains redundancies and mild purple phrasing, alongside small errors (“an sudden,” “an new”) that disrupt polish. Several sentences summarize rather than carry pressure, blunting momentum in the middle build. The “glitchy text/quantum promise” language loops without added precision. Information density is adequate but rarely multi‑tasking.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line‑level craft suffers from synonym/idea loops and stock intensifiers (“secrets of the universe,” “hidden truth”) that reduce density. Repeated sentence stems and near‑duplicate phrases slow momentum, particularly in the final third, muting the closure image. Figurative language trends purple without fresh vehicles. Many sentences restate functionally identical content.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level loops and synonym churn (“As reality shifted,” “the mystical energies,” “shivering bliss”) recur, dulling momentum. Several adjacent sentences restate the same development with minimal new pressure. Figurative language trends generic and stacked, edging toward purple in the climax. Syntax variety is limited by repetitive openings and similar sentence lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line-level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and abstract diction, producing mild purple drift (“tapestry of unknown histories,” “gentle glow of remembrance”). Information density is adequate but momentum slows under repetition. Strong verbs and concrete actions are outnumbered by nominalized summaries. The final third repeats prior claims, dulling the closing image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and often musical, with recurring images that create continuity. Yet repetition (“tyranny of indifference,” “revised histories,” night/stars) and paraphrase loops dilute momentum. Figurative density sometimes trends purple without adding new pressure. The final third remains clear but not sharp with line-level surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line craft is clean but redundancies (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid” echoes) and paraphrase loops flatten momentum. Figurative density occasionally tips purple without adding new information. The cadence lacks sharper pivots, softening impact at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean and readable, with some luminous phrasing, but it relies on adjective stacks and phrase loops (“soft, ethereal radiance”; repeated “As she worked…”/“As she…” openings) that dilute momentum. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same content (working, decoding, transformed), reducing density. Purple‑leaning modifiers outpace concrete embodiment in peak beats. Final third repeats ideas rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean and readable with credible rhythm, but redundancy and abstraction accumulate (“felt a sense of,” “was driven,” “seemed”) and several near‑duplicates flatten momentum. Occasional purple touches and stock constructions (“the air was filled with the scent of possibility”) reduce density. The closing cadence is serviceable but not cutting. Mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lines are clean and grammatical with steady cadence, but abstraction and repetition create mild drift. Several paraphrase loops and stock formulations flatten impact (“true beauty lay not in perfection,” “test the boundaries”). Information density is adequate yet could be sharper with more concrete, scene‑level moves. The closing image is clear but not freshly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and readable with a steady cadence, but repeats images/phrases (“mist swirled,” harp’s notes) without added pressure. Occasional tell-y lines and abstractions (“sense of purpose,” “modestly fearless”) dilute density. Figurative choices are coherent, if safe. Momentum holds, though minor redundancies could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean but leans on repetition and abstract telling (“she was beginning to understand...,” “the memories came flooding back”). Several paraphrase loops and similar sentence stems reduce momentum. Figurative density is low but also low in specificity, relying on generalized sensations. The final image is clear yet not texturally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are generally clean and musical, but paraphrase loops and motif repetition dampen momentum (“As she…,” “She knew…,” reiterated anchors/instant). Figurative language is tasteful yet occasionally generic or redundant. Information density is decent, though a few lines tell what others already show. The final image lands, but line‑level pressure never sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line‑level clarity is solid and the prose carries mood efficiently, but there are paraphrase loops (“secrets,” “weightless burden”) and a few stock phrases. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent; minor purple notes and redundancy slow momentum. Syntax variety is adequate, with some same‑stem sentence runs. The final image is clean despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and imagistic, with strong noun-verb choices in key images. However, paraphrase loops and purple drift (“soft, golden light,” “swirling clouds”) dilute momentum. Figurative density occasionally stacks rather than sharpens. Clarity remains, but propulsion softens at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean sentences and controlled rhythm with some strong images (“time… a mantle,” shard as talisman). Minor redundancy (“burnished sorrow,” “words flowing like a river”) and a few summarizing lines dampen momentum. Figurative language stays legible; no major mixed metaphors. Overall polished, if slightly over-declared in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are polished and grammatical, with vivid images and purposeful cadence. Some redundancy and ornamental phrasing (“mend what wasn’t torn,” “reclaim the light stolen by midnight”) recur without adding pressure. Figurative density occasionally blurs edge clarity but does not impede closure comprehension. Momentum holds, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    Strong sensory lines are offset by paraphrase loops and stacked modifiers (“luminescence… luminescent fungi,” “otherworldly energy,” “subtle frequencies”). Several sentences restate state-of-mind without adding pressure, slowing momentum. The “deciphered the symbols” summary skips dramatization at a peak beat. Clean mechanics, but density and propulsion could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clean syntax and few surface errors, but redundancy and abstraction creep in—several sentences rephrase the same ideas (“layered meanings,” “hidden patterns and connections”). Figurative language sometimes feels generic rather than embodied, flattening momentum. Information density is adequate yet could cut scaffolding to sharpen turns.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences and consistent grammar are offset by paraphrase loops and repeated formulations that reduce density (“The postcards…” recur with similar function; “umbral tenderness” and “dawning hush” echo). Figurative language is serviceable but occasionally purple, and a minor error (“a absence”) slips through. Momentum lulls as descriptions restate mood instead of adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean grammar and clear sequencing, but there’s noticeable scaffolding and repetends (“As she…” stems, reiterated purpose and atmosphere). Figurative language stays in safe, sometimes purple registers without fresh torque. Momentum sags where sentences restate mood or motive. Still, no major muddle or syntactic confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but paraphrase loops and template stems slow momentum. Figurative density stays safe; limited mixed metaphors. Several near‑duplicates (“the alchemist’s eyes… the alchemist’s eyes…”) and summary weaken propulsion, especially around the ending. Information density is modest for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops recur; many sentences restate the same content with minimal new pressure. “Velvet disquiet” and similar phrases reappear without development, and the cadence is often uniform. Information density and propulsion are modest, especially in the final third where pattern reiterates rather than tightens. Clean mechanics, but overwriting and rhythm monotony dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clean sentences and fluent flow, but repetition of structures (“She knew…,” “The seed saver…”) and abstract nouns create mild redundancy. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent; occasional purple or platitudinous lines blunt impact. Information density is decent though several sentences restate purpose without adding pressure. No major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and readable with a steady cadence; key images (bell, wind, hush) carry weight. Some paraphrase and scaffold loops (“As she…”, reiterations of routine and listening) reduce momentum and density. Figurative language is modest and coherent; no mixed-metaphor tangles. The final image is clear though slightly overexplained just before it.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“flourishing stillness,” “strength in vulnerability”) dilute momentum. Figurative language is safe and sometimes purple, with stacked abstractions that reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences do single duty. Mechanics are clean but the cadence becomes predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level craft is clean and readable, but paraphrase loops and template stems recur (“The recluse…,” “their gaze…,” “the box…”), dulling momentum. Figurative density stays manageable, yet some phrasing leans purple or generic. Information density could tighten by pruning near‑duplicates. The final cadence lands, though sentence variety could better charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level repetition and paraphrase loops are frequent, diluting momentum (“As the…,” “The timekeeper’s…,” “The world…” stems recur). Abstract phrasing and summary replace scene texture; images sometimes repeat without additive information. Minimal syntactic variety and over-reliance on declarative statements blunt cadence. Clean grammar, but density and propulsion are low.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line craft is graceful but leans into purple repetition (“burnished hush,” “woven”) and synonym loops that could tighten. Sentences often do one job where they could do two; momentum occasionally stalls in restatement. Figurative language is largely coherent, if lush. Clean mechanics and sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level clarity is solid, but repetition (“gently systematic,” “brazen calm,” restated motives) introduces paraphrase loops and reduces information density. Syntax and rhythm skew uniform, limiting propulsion. Strong images (living stone pillars, copper harmonics) lift texture, yet the prose often tells what it already showed. Tightening would sharpen momentum and concentrate charge.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clean mechanics and some striking images, but paraphrase loops and template stems recur—especially the repeated “The skeptic…” structuring and intensifier restatements (“heavier,” “deepening,” “anticipation”). Figurative density edges purple without fresh turns of thought. Information density is moderate; momentum slackens through redundant descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line craft is clean and rhythmic, but redundancy and generic modifiers accumulate (“sweet scent,” “vibrant and alive,” repeated “blooming”). Figurative density trends safe rather than sharp; little multi‑tasking per sentence. Momentum lulls via paraphrase‑like reiterations of harmony and promise. Clarity is intact; compression could heighten charge.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are clean and fluent with some effective images, yet repetition and generalities appear (“deep sense of belonging,” “wild hush”). Several beats tell rather than show key pressure, reducing momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent but seldom surprising. The final paragraph lands clearly if somewhat pre‑packaged.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clean and readable, but redundancy and stock phrasing dilute impact (“echoed silence,” “gentle breeze,” reiterations of stillness/movement). Several sentences restate similar content without new pressure. Figurative density is mild but not cutting. The final cadence lands clearly despite softness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Readable, often graceful lines, but there’s repetition (“cautious abandon,” “sacredly playful”) and filler scaffolding that could be trimmed. Intensifiers stack without adding new pressure, and some phrasing leans purple. Momentum softens during exposition of lore and mission. No major artifacts, but density/propulsion could improve.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and mostly economical; some conceptual redundancy (“luminous absence,” “unbind the past”) softens momentum. Images are coherent and not over-mixed; syntax is steady but can verge on inert. A few lines do double duty, yet concrete embodiment is limited. The cadence supports mood more than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is fluent but over-saturated with modifiers and abstractions, risking purple prose and slowing momentum. Some paraphrase/idea loops (e.g., repeating transformation and threshold notions) reduce density. When pressure should crest, metaphoric stacking diffuses force. Clarity survives, but propulsion is dampened.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is smooth and readable, but leans on repeated constructions and motifs (“woven hush,” “fabric of time”) that blur edge. Some paraphrase and intensifier loops stall momentum. Imagery trends purple without fresh turns in later beats. Rhythm is steady yet monotone, softening peak cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    Musical cadence and image patterns please the ear, but repetition and synonym loops (“mist,” “spire,” “refract”) verge on redundancy. Figurative language sometimes stacks without adding new pressure, softening momentum. Lines generally remain clear, but a few could compress without losing sense. The closure image survives, though purple tendencies limit precision.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is generally clear and propulsive, but paraphrase loops and motif reiterations (“kintsugi intentions,” “conjure meaning”) create drag. Purple lean in the finale blunts the charge. Sentence rhythm varies, yet redundancy dims momentum in peak beats. Clean mechanics and imagery keep it readable.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean sentences with some lovely images, but redundancy (“melted away,” “temporary eternity,” “intimately aloof”) and mild purple tint reduce density. Several adjacent lines restate states rather than advance pressure. Cadence stays similar across beats, dampening propulsion. Overall readable, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft shows polish and sensory density, but redundancy and purple-leaning abstractions accumulate (“gentle whisper,” “vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness” recur without new torque). Several nearby sentences paraphrase the same state, slowing momentum. Figurative choices sometimes stack without sharpening meaning, softening the crescendo’s edge. The final third retains clarity but not maximal concision.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean, readable lines with some evocative phrases, but redundancy and cliché (“open wound,” “beacon,” “brighter future”) dampen freshness. Repetition of structures and summary reduce momentum and density. Figurative language is safe and occasionally stock; limited syntactic variation creates a mild drumbeat. Overall clarity holds, but the prose seldom surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lines are clear and largely clean, but repetition and abstraction (“their rational mind,” “truthful nature,” “psychological safety”) sap momentum. Information density is decent; some scaffold and summary could be cut or made scene. Figurative language is controlled, if safe. The final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and an even cadence support clarity, but paraphrase loops and reiterated concepts (“witnessed isolation,” “mist swirling”) reduce momentum. Figurative language is serviceable, not overblown, yet redundancy dampens line-level propulsion. Information density is moderate; some lines restate without adding pressure. The final image is clear but could be sharpened with tighter cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops reduce momentum (“blooming flowers,” “glimmer,” “As…” leads). Abstractions (“lingering promise,” “doorway of decisions”) are stated rather than embodied, and several beats tell what trials occurred instead of showing. Modifiers and stock phrasing flatten specificity. The final third continues summary diction, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level craft shows overwriting and loops: “bleeding starlight” recurs without fresh inflection; “lacy” repeats awkwardly; multiple sentences restate menace without adding information. Filter verbs and “as if” clauses dilute immediacy. Momentum stalls in paraphrase‑like reiterations, especially near the ending where specificity is most needed. Syntax and paragraph rhythm are uniform, limiting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vivid lines sit beside redundancy and purple abstractions (“density of presence” repeats; “quiet alchemy”). Several paraphrase loops state the same progression of wonder without adding pressure. Sentence openings and structures echo, creating mild syntactic monotony. Clarity holds, but momentum sags.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clean sentences and grammar, but notable looped phrasing and conceptual redundancy (“distilled chaos,” repeated motif claims) reduce propulsion. Figurative language tends generic rather than precise; rhythm flattens into uniform cadence. The final third continues to tell rather than sharpen image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clean mechanics and some graceful lines, but redundancy (“ordinary miracles,” “trembling calm,” “read between the lines”) creates paraphrase loops. Abstraction outweighs concrete action, reducing momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than incisive. Cutting repeated assertions and sharpening images would concentrate force.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clean, readable lines with sensory texture; sandalwood, whispers, and scratch of quill carry momentum. Some purple redundancy and abstract phrasing create mild drag (“mystical forces,” repeated stillness motifs), limiting propulsion. The final image is crisp despite modest overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Evocative lines and clean mechanics, but purple drift and conceptual redundancy appear (“imperfect miracles” restated, similar cadences), softening propulsion. Figurative density is high without always adding new information, and some abstractions could be compressed. Still, the crucial beats read clearly and the final cadence lands. Minor scaffold remains but doesn’t obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level shows repetition (“hush,” “stillness,” “unity”) and paraphrase loops that dilute momentum. Figurative density leans purple without fresh vehicles, and several sentences restate prior claims. Information density is modest; key beats are summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and reiterations that don’t add pressure (“the counting continued,” “ever vigilant,” “fjords quiet” mood restated). Figurative language is restrained but sometimes generic; several sentences do single duty. Rhythm lacks variation, leading to a lull that flattens the ending’s charge. Concision and specificity could sharpen both momentum and image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is clear and often beautiful, but redundancy and purple turns recur (“quiet wildfire,” multiple near-duplicate realizations). Several sentences restate similar insights with minimal new pressure. Figurative language clusters without adding precision. Momentum softens in the middle as images loop rather than build.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean grammar and clarity prevail, but there’s scaffold and repetition (“seemed,” “glow,” “resolve,” “determined”) and mild purple notes (“clover melancholy,” “ethereal”). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar sentiments, slowing momentum. Tighter cuts and fresher verbs would improve density without losing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clean sentences and coherent cadence, but paraphrase loops and repeated adjectives (“haunting,” “hum,” “loop”) dull propulsion. Information density is adequate, yet several sentences restate prior content with minor variation. Figurative language is consistent but not progressive. Line‑level momentum flags in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but paraphrase loops and stock modifiers flatten momentum. Phrases like “haunted euphoria,” “weight of small moments,” and repeated sentence stems create a template cadence. Figurative density is mild but repetitive. Information‑per‑line is modest, with several sentences restating prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences and few grammatical issues, but line‑level often tells and doubles ideas (“desperation and despair… giving way”), with low information density. Paraphrase/repetition appears (“As the night wore on” recurrence; iterative crowd descriptions) which slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is safe; no muddle, but little propulsion. Cutting redundancies would tighten the piece considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and often luminous, with strong sensory economy for a lyric mode. There is some repetition (“quiet blaze,” similar sentence openings) and a touch of purple in generalized declarations. Information density is decent, but momentum softens with paraphrase‑like restatements of awe. Final image is clear despite the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and largely free of errors, with a gentle cadence that carries the piece. Some paraphrase/idea loops and stock phrases reduce density and edge. Figurative language remains coherent but safe; moments invite sharper concrete detail. The final lines land cleanly without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft is clear, but repetition and scaffolded statements dilute momentum (“It became clear…”, “The advisor’s… gift was a reminder…”). Figurative texture tends to restate theme rather than discover new angles. The prose avoids muddle yet relies on generic modifiers and summary. The final third repeats motifs without fresh compression, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean mechanics, but repetition and paraphrase reduce density (“trail of artistic creations” recurs with near‑duplicates; “testament” appears multiple times). Figurative choices trend purple and general, blurring edge and momentum. The final third includes summary‑like declarations that dull the closure image. Cutting redundancies and sharpening verbs would markedly improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line‑level craft shows repetition and mild purple tendencies (“hush of the universe,” “she knew that” scaffolds), plus paraphrase echoes that slow momentum. Sentences often restate similar emotional beats without new pressure. Rhythm is readable, but density sometimes blurs acuity. The closing cadence is clean, if a touch over‑ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lines are clean and readable with some evocative images (“howling… like a chorus of restless spirits”). Repetition of “labyrinth” and explanatory phrasing add mild scaffold. Figurative density remains controlled but not uniquely sharp. Momentum is steady, with a few near‑echo sentences that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level craft is clean but padded by repetition and abstract labels; phrases like “stillwater tension” and “silent empathy” recur without adding pressure. Figurative density leans purple, with synonym loops and restated beats (gaze, calm, connection). The final image is clear, yet momentum suffers from redundancy. Greater compression and fresher, embodied specifics would heighten force.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetition and near‑loops (“mist,” “unspoken words,” “amplified quiet”) dull momentum, and several sentences restate the same beat. Figurative density crowds clarity at times without deepening pressure. Syntax patterns repeat, producing a lulling cadence that undercuts turns. The prose is clean but often padded and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line‑level density tips into purple at times, with loops and stock abstractions (“true nature,” “freedom,” “essence”) and repeated stems. Several adjacent sentences restate sensations (pull, unlocking, peace) without adding specificity. The whale and scrimshaw images carry; trimming redundancy would sharpen momentum. Mechanics are clean, but overwriting dampens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean sentences and effective images avoid purple excess, with good cadence and repetition used purposefully. Some conceptual repetition (“remade hush,” “cultivating lightness in grief”) and tell‑leaning phrases slow momentum. Information density is decent but not razor‑tight; a few lines could be cut without loss. Final image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Imagery is lush, but frequent paraphrase loops and stacked modifiers slow momentum (“testament to the power of art,” “lantern‑moth hush” reprise without new pressure). Several adjacent sentences restate transformation in similar terms, thinning density. Grammar/mechanics are clean; clarity remains, but purple saturation blurs edge. Cutting redundancies would sharpen cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lines are clean and grammatical, but there’s redundancy (“imperfection” celebrated repeatedly) and summary patches that drain momentum. Figurative language is restrained; no major mixed metaphors, yet several platitudes flatten texture. Sentence variety is modest; propulsion is limited by telling. Information density could be higher at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line-level redundancy and paraphrase loops are frequent, with stacked modifiers and repeated constructions dulling momentum. Figurative language is often generic and static rather than building pressure. The final meta line reads as a scaffolding artifact, blunting the closure image. Clarity holds, but propulsion suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is fluent, but figurative density and synonymic loops create mild purple wash and momentum drag. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar sentiments (illumination, renewed purpose) rather than compounding pressure. Information density is moderate; more action‑grounded specifics would sharpen. The final third includes tell‑phrases that soften the closure’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elegant lines and strong images, but redundancy and synonym loops sap momentum (“the cartomancer” repeated; similar sentences reiterate purpose). Abstract formulations and stacked modifiers drift toward purple in places. The final third reiterates insights instead of compressing to a sharper image‑action beat. Clarity is intact, density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lines are generally clean, but purple drift and abstraction recur (“atoms of nostalgia,” “true potential”) with mild paraphrase loops in the closing paragraphs. A noticeable typo (“poured over” for “pored over”) and redundancy around transformation soften precision. Momentum is maintained, yet density could rise with sharper, more concrete turns in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush and clear but edges into redundancy (recurrent “luminescent orbs,” “softly deliberate,” and parallel sentence stems). Abstractions occasionally substitute for concrete pressure, softening propulsion. Rhythm remains readable yet uniform in places, with paraphrase loops that could be cut for density. Figurative language is coherent but sometimes safe.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is clean, but paraphrase loops and repeated phrasing reduce momentum. Figurative density leans purple and recycles motifs without fresh angles, softening impact. Several sentences redundantly restate her purpose and the atmosphere. Rhythm is steady but risks monotony rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line craft is competent with strong sensory detail, but repetition and softeners (“seemed,” “as if”) dilute force. Some paraphrase loops and ornate choices (“meteor hush”) feel decorative rather than clarifying. Figurative density is high without always paying off in precision. Momentum holds, yet trimming redundancies would tighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level clarity holds and images are coherent, but redundancy (“enduring power of love,” “unused love”) and template stems reduce propulsion. Figurative density skews purple in places without adding new information. Rhythm is steady rather than dynamically varied, and a few paragraphs paraphrase prior content. Clean but not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line craft offers luminous images, yet repetition (“stardust,” “whispers,” “tracing”) and near‑duplicate sentiments slow momentum. Figurative density stays high with limited variation, flirting with overwriting. Information density could improve via cuts that keep only images that shift pressure. The final cadence is clear, but a leaner line would hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line‑level craft is clean and often musical, with concrete images like sand shimmer and ticking clock. Some redundancy and purple phrasing (“fractured lullaby,” “essence,” “glow…disorienting”) lightly inflate texture without adding pressure. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, though several sentences rephrase similar effects. Clarity holds at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and formulaic repeats (“The wind rustled…,” “The hum of insight…”) reduce momentum and density. Figurative layering is safe but occasionally redundant, with little propulsion shift at high‑pressure lines. Sentence patterns recur, creating drumbeat cadence. Clarity holds, but tightening is needed to avoid self‑echo.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is polished and readable, but paraphrase loops and repeated stems modestly dull momentum. Several near-duplicate lines and phrase recurrences signal scaffold (“their footsteps quiet,” “gentle persistence,” “shoreline lullaby”). Figurative language is controlled and clear; no mixed metaphors. Information density is adequate but could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    Several strong images (cobalt fortress, slight discoloration) sit beside repetitive, generalized phrasing and thematic paraphrase loops. The prose occasionally over-explains what the images already imply, slowing momentum. Syntax is clean but drifts toward summary in the final third. Higher compression and cutting redundancies would sharpen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level writing is clear and mostly clean, with evocative details. Redundancies and template stems (“As the…,” “With each passing night…”) create mild loopiness that slows momentum. Some purple touches and abstract intensifiers flatten pressure in peak beats. The final image is effective, but sentence rhythm is monotone across the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean and readable, but repetition and echoing stems dilute momentum (frequent “rhythm,” “eternal,” “whisper” motifs). Some purple, generalized lines reduce information density and specificity. Paragraphs often restate mood rather than advance pressure, creating mild loopiness. Final beats are clear but not sharpened by line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean mechanics and some strong lines, but paraphrase loops and template stems reduce propulsion (repeated “margin of daylight,” reiterations of hum/resolve). Figurative density is mostly coherent yet occasionally redundant. Information density could be higher with tightened phrasing and varied syntax. The final third retains clarity but not maximal compression.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is clear and readable but drifts purple: frequent modifiers and similar figurative moves create redundancy without adding pressure. Paraphrase loops (“she knew…she knew”) and repeated symbolic vocabulary reduce information density. The final third keeps clarity but offers few hard, specific actions to counter the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft offers vivid images but leans into repetition and purple tendencies: frequent “seemed,” echoing phrases (“a sense of peace settle over her”), and metaphor stacks. Some synonyms and near-duplicate sentiments create loopiness and slow momentum. The prose remains clear but could be tightened for density and propulsion. Cutting redundancy would markedly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft shows musicality and image density, but repetition (“luminescent ache,” “forgotten library,” “necessary darkness”) approaches paraphrase loops. Figurative language is frequent, sometimes generic, risking purple haze over precision. Momentum holds, yet several adjacent sentences reiterate concept rather than advancing pressure. Clarity remains, but trims would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing keep momentum, but repetition (“Kael…” sentence stems; reasserted states) and telling reduce density. Imagery is serviceable; some lines loop concepts without advancing pressure. The final paragraphs lean into summary cadence. No major artifacts, but the line-level lacks the compression and torque for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and mostly fluent, but contains paraphrase loops and generic intensifiers that add little (“the world above the library would never be the same”). Abstraction substitutes for specific action at pivotal beats, and rhythm sometimes flattens under repetitive structures. Figures and motifs recur without fresh reweighting. Clarity holds, yet momentum softens where summary replaces scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions sap momentum. Key phrases recur without new charge, producing mild purple overtones. Information density is adequate but could compress and vary rhythm more. Final lines repeat established insights rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clear sentences and clean mechanics, but line-level redundancy (“As the night wore on” recurrence; echoing structures) slows momentum. Figurative language is apt yet occasionally generic (“magic that lay just beneath the surface”). Information density is adequate, though several sentences paraphrase prior ones without adding pressure. The final image is clear despite minor loops.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean sentences and readable flow, but repetition (“orbits of regret,” “mist,” “truth”) and scaffolded assertions accumulate. Some purple touches and generic formulations (“no matter the cost”) reduce precision. Momentum drifts with summary lines that duplicate prior content. The final image is clear but leans on declarative uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lush prose with clear imagery, but paraphrase loops and repeated stems (“The tattooist… she…”) reduce momentum. Occasional purple tendencies and redundant intensifiers (“both calming and unsettling”) blur precision. Line-level economy could tighten without losing music. The final image is clear despite the density.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft shows control but suffers from paraphrase loops and repeated sentences (e.g., “The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world” appears twice). Figurative density at times edges purple (“lilac unease” reiterated), reducing propulsion. Syntax patterns recur without purposeful escalation, flattening momentum. Clarity holds, but economy and variation would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line‑level craft shows fluency but slides into redundancy and purple abstractions (“warm coldness,” “beacon of warmth,” restated hope), with paraphrase loops across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without always advancing the moment, and several sentences state what the image already implies. Momentum softens in the final third due to explanatory moralizing. Clean mechanics, but tighter compression and specificity would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lines are clean and mostly grammatical, but purple tendencies and synonym loops (“as if,” “seemed,” “the garden…”) recur. Several sentences restate outcome rather than showing it, reducing momentum. Rhythm leans uniform with many “As…” or cumulative clauses. The final image lands but is dulled by prior redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful images (scented air, tingling skin) and workable cadence. Redundancies and on‑the‑nose scaffolding (“Her motivation was clear”) slow momentum. Repetition of key nouns without variation and some generalized abstractions create mild density bloat. The final sentence lands, though the lead‑up could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line‑level contains paraphrase loops and stock formulations (“full of secrets,” “at peace,” repeated “she smiled,” “float on a tide of emotions”). Figurative density leans purple without adding pressure, and several near-duplicates stall momentum. Syntax often repeats similar openings, muting propulsion. Readable but in need of precision cuts and fresher images.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and some strong sensory lines, but paraphrase loops and repeated formulations (“raw possibility,” “shared wisdom,” “unearthed silence”) reduce propulsion. Modifiers stack into purple territory in places, softening clarity and momentum. Sentence rhythm is relatively uniform, with limited variation at peak beats. Density is decent, yet several sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean grammar and readable flow, but paraphrase loops and stock formulations dampen momentum (“a sense of…,” “The mist swirled…” repeats). Figurative density is safe rather than surprising; some modifiers feel generic. Information density could be higher with tighter cuts around repeated sentiments. Final third retains clarity but leans on summary cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level texture is often lovely, but the prose trends toward purple and repetition (e.g., multiple “soft lapping,” layered abstractions). Many sentences carry similar cadences and stacked modifiers, which slow momentum. Some metaphors feel over‑selected without adding pressure. Tightening would heighten propulsion without losing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line‑level craft is clear and largely clean, but paraphrase loops and repeated phrasing (“faded lantern glass,” “thrum,” multiple “As the…” entries) dilute momentum. Figurative choices are harmonious, though occasionally purple and redundant. Variation in sentence structure could better pace the accumulation. The final third maintains clarity but doesn’t sharpen language under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line craft is polished, with strong image economy and few mechanical issues. Some paraphrase/reiteration slightly slows momentum and skirts purple (“weaving a spell of protected vulnerability”). Overall clarity holds and sentences carry multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean if a bit plush.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean syntax and copy, but paraphrase loops and near‑duplicate phrases (“hum of the stone circle,” “brittle awakenings”) recur without new pressure. Figurative language remains safe; information density could be higher. Momentum lulls due to reiteration rather than progressive revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean sentences and pleasant rhythm, but redundancy appears (“As she…” openings; repeated abstractions like “connection” and “thread”). Figurative language is controlled, yet some lines paraphrase prior content without adding pressure. Momentum softens as the ending explains meaning directly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line‑level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold (“she felt,” “sense of,” “as”) that dilute momentum. Abstract phrasing and stock formulations (“restore balance,” “electric with possibility”) crowd out concrete action. The climactic beat is summarized rather than dramatized, dulling impact. Syntax and openings repeat, producing drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Fluid sentences and clear sequencing, but occasional purple density and synonym loops (organ reverberations/melody references recur without new pressure). Some abstractions (“vitality,” “underlying structure”) tell where image could carry. Rhythm remains readable, yet momentum softens around thematic statements. Overall clean, if occasionally over‑embroidered.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics with a controlled, gentle cadence, but reliance on abstractions and repeated motifs (“mist,” “essence”) creates mild redundancy. Several sentences paraphrase the same insight, softening momentum. Figurative choices (“lance the boil”) spike then retreat to generalities. Information density is moderate without line‑level spark.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops (“As the night wore on…”, “The copper nail…”) and reiterations drain momentum. Figurative language is serviceable but generic, with occasional purple phrasing. Information density is modest and propulsion weak in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level craft is clean but leans into repetition and purple phrasing; several lines repackage the same claim (art transforms, secrets lift). Figurative density outpaces scene pressure, and slogan‑like motifs recur without new angles. Momentum softens in the middle, though clarity remains intact. Cutting redundancies would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and readable, with a measured rhythm; however, motif repetition and paraphrase drag momentum. Several sentences restate similar insights (“rise and fall,” “not in destination but stories”), tipping into summary. Imagery is stable but occasionally generic; density could be sharper. No major grammatical or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and steady rhythm; atmospheric lines do multiple jobs. Repetition and paraphrase loops (“shared burdens,” “midnight solace,” “stars shone bright”) reduce density. Some telling leans on platitudes rather than image-driven insight. Still, mechanics are sound and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line‑level shows repetition and scaffold (“The druid” stems; restated aims), with paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Figurative language occasionally works, but the prose often tells what it just showed. Information density is modest; several sentences do single duty. Final beats avoid muddle but remain prosaic, with limited propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line craft is clean and musical, but paraphrase loops and adjective density dilute momentum. Several near‑duplicate assertions restate wonder and boundlessness without adding pressure. Figurative language is coherent yet overpresent. Information density would improve with pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean mechanics and readable flow, but line‑level density trends purple with synonym loops and repeated structures. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same interior state (darkness receding, peace settling). The reliance on modifiers and abstract nouns (“energy,” “destiny,” “resolve”) reduces precision. Rhythm could vary more to sharpen turns.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line-level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and stock phrasing (“washed over him,” “spark of a new beginning,” repeated “silence” refrains). Information density is modest; several sentences restate prior sentiments without new pressure. Figurative language trends generic, softening propulsion. Tighter cuts and image-specific verbs would help.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.6)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“reestablish the connection” appears often) sap momentum. Abstract phrasing and stacked modifiers tilt purple without adding new information. Many sentences restate intent rather than advance situation, reducing propulsion. The final third keeps summarizing rather than sharpening images.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Polished sentences and pleasant rhythm, but redundancy and generalized phrasing recur (“gentle, relentless passage of time”; reiterated mission statements). Figurative language trends uniform, with little propulsion. Line‑level remains clear but not particularly taut.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lines are clean and grammatical but often paraphrase themselves (reiterating “latent radiance,” “vessel,” “confessions”) and lean on stock metaphors (walls around the heart). Figurative density trends purple in places without new information. Momentum softens under repetition and summary diction (“It was a task she undertook with trepidation”). The final third retains clarity but continues the abstract vocabulary rather than tightening sensory leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    Redundancy and paraphrase loops dull momentum (“forgiveness was a journey, not a destination” appears twice in essence; “the world, it seemed” recurs). Several lines restate stakes without adding pressure. Figurative language is serviceable but rarely surprising, and repetition in the final third blunts the closure image. Tighter cuts would sharpen cadence and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line craft is clean and rhythmic, but purple tendencies and paraphrase loops appear (“forever changed,” echoing mist/fade beats). Several sentences restate similar insights, reducing momentum. Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent; information load per line could be tightened. The final third remains clear but not razor‑economical.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are generally clean and musical, with strong sensory cues. There’s some redundancy (“midsummer sun dipped” echoes; assertion loops like “she was determined”). Figurative density occasionally borders on purple without adding pressure. Momentum holds but could be tighter with trimmed reiterations.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are clear and rhythmic, but redundancy (“soft,” “radiant,” “gentle,” repeated “threshold of stillness”) dulls momentum. Figurative texture occasionally tips purple without adding pressure. Despite that, information density is decent and sequencing is clean. The final image lands without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and reiterated motifs drain momentum (“vineyard hush,” cycle statements, repeated assurances). Figurative language skews purple at times without adding new information. Many sentences do single duty and could compress. The closure image is clear but underpowered by the line‑level redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line‑level repetition and summarizing scaffolds (“The conscience…”) slow momentum and dilute images. Figurative language is safe and occasionally redundant (“sincerely insincere” recurs without new torque). Many sentences restate aims and outcomes rather than advancing scene. Rhythm is uniform, with few syntactic shifts to mark turns.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but paraphrase loops and scaffold prose (“she began to…,” “as she…,” “the researcher knew…”) sap momentum. Figurative texture is safe and repeated rather than deepening. Information density is modest; multiple sentences restate the lesson’s nature. The final third maintains sameness of cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Imagery is strong and purposeful, but paraphrase loops and repeated scaffolds (“As the dust continued to fall…”, “a reminder…”) sap momentum. Some abstractions (“secrets of the universe”) blur sharpness at peak beats. Syntax is mostly clean with good sensory density. A trim for repetition would lift line‑level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean but padded by repetition and synonym loops (e.g., recurring “lingering luminance,” reiterated realizations). Figurative density sometimes approaches purple without new information, slowing momentum. Many sentences restate prior content rather than adding pressure or texture. The final image is clear but arrives via told scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean mechanics and some strong images, but redundancy and stock formulations accrue (“almost palpable” appears twice; “echoing off” repeats; frequent “he felt”). Several sentences restate discovery/resolve without adding pressure. Figurative language is safe and occasionally purple, softening propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is clean but padded by paraphrase loops and familiar modifiers, leading to mild purple tilt. Several sentences restate fulfillment and alignment without adding pressure. Rhythm is steady but lacks propulsion through the middle. Strongest lines center on the apparatus and droplet; weakest on thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    Line-level craft is clear but prone to redundancy and purple tonal drift (repeated “echo,” “sacrifice,” and similar sentence openings). A few paraphrase loops and stock formulations sap momentum. Imagery is often strong, yet could compress to reduce sameness and heighten turns. Final images land despite some overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lines are clean and mostly economical; sensory images pull double duty. Some paraphrase and conceptual repetition (“brittle devotion,” “plausible impossibility,” “balance/harmony”) create mild loopiness. Figurative language remains coherent and supports cadence. Momentum holds with minimal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level craft features repeated stems and concept loops that dilute momentum (multiple iterations of “The warden’s thoughts turned…” and restated purpose). Some purple phrasings (“morbid perfume,” “mirrored hush”) stack without new information. Sentences often do one job instead of two, and paraphrase‑like echoes slow propulsion. Clean mechanics, but information density and variety could improve.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and pleasantly textured, yet it repeats constructs and abstract labels (“wonder,” “harmony”) and occasionally leans purple. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar sentiments, softening momentum. Imagery is consistent, but the final third includes summary statements that could be dramatized. Line‑level craft is solid but not razor‑tight.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is clear but padded by paraphrase loops and repeated motifs that do the same work (“soundless echo,” re‑asserted burden/trust). Figurative density leans purple at times without new angles, sapping propulsion. Many sentences restate intent rather than advance pressure. Cadence varies, but momentum drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.5)
    Paraphrase loops and near-duplicate assertions recur, especially around purpose and clarity; several sentences do single-duty. Abstract diction and intensifiers (“very fabric of reality”) drift toward purple without adding precision. Rhythm is monotonous with similar openings and clause structures. Mechanics are clean, but density and propulsion are low.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clear and readable, with steady cadence and clean syntax. Redundancy and motif overuse (“flow,” “storm‑born,” repeated abstractions) create mild loopiness and dilute impact. Figurative language tilts purple in spots without adding precision. Line‑level economy could be tightened to increase momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level overwriting and repetition occasionally dull momentum; the hourglass sentence contains a visible duplication error. Several near-duplicate phrases and intensifiers (“haunting,” “mournful”) create synonym churn. Figurative density is high without always earning it, though basic clarity survives. Trimming would heighten propulsion and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is evocative but leans purple and repetitive (mist/statues motifs recur without new pressure). Several near-duplicate assertions slow momentum and dilute impact. Syntax is clean and readable, yet density sometimes becomes decorative rather than propulsive. A tighter verb economy and fresher figurative range would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean mechanics and some strong images, but purple tendencies and repetition (“penny drops,” “frozen bloom,” abstract intensifiers) slow momentum. Several sentences paraphrase preceding ideas without adding pressure. Figurative density occasionally blurs edges of action during peak beats. Clarity holds, but line‑level economy and freshness need tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line craft is clean but trends toward overwriting and paraphrase loops, with thematic reiterations that dilute momentum. Figurative density occasionally outpaces pressure, softening clarity at key beats. Strong nouns and sensory verbs do work, yet several sentences restate prior content. The final third’s explanatory tone dulls the closure image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level craft shows some evocative turns, but repetition and paraphrase loops appear (“flowing like the sands,” reiterations of wonder/trepidation). Figurative density sometimes leans generic and stacks without deepening meaning, softening propulsion. Several sentences tell what the image already shows, creating mild drag. Clean mechanics but moderate overwriting in the final third dampens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“ever‑shifting,” “texture of connection,” “rational enchantment,” “erupt”) dilute momentum, including in the final third. Figurative language is coherent but overused, with limited new information per sentence. Several adjacent sentences restate the same beat without added pressure. The prose is clean syntactically but could be pruned for density.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and near‑duplicates (“benthic city once dark now beacon,” “unfolded horizons”) dilute momentum. Figurative language is conventional and sometimes purple without deepening sense. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme. Line‑level clarity holds, but propulsion and compression are undercut by redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean mechanics and a readable flow, but paraphrase loops and stock formulations (mist/hum repeats, generalized comfort language) dilute line density. Figurative texture remains safe and sometimes inert. Rhythm is even, verging on monotone, with limited modulation at the turn. Tighter cuts and fresher verbs would lift momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean, mostly concise lines carry momentum; sensory choices are apt. Some summary repetition (“determined to uncover its secrets,” reiterated motivations) and tell‑leaning scaffolds flatten peak beats. Figurative language stays controlled, though a few phrases recur without new charge. Final image is clear but not linguistically sharpened to elevate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and often graceful, but leans into ornamental repetition and near‑duplicates that could be tightened. Figurative density occasionally flattens into synonyms for “mystery/solace” without adding new information. Several sentences restate the same emotional state, softening momentum. Final image lands but with mild purple overcast.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Evocative diction, but paraphrase loops and near‑duplicate stems (“The storyteller…,” “As the birds…”) slow momentum. Abstract nouns (“whispers,” “patterns,” “essence”) stack without fresh concrete pivots, edging toward purple in places. Rhythm seldom varies at turns, dulling the closure’s punch. Line‑level density is high but not always doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.0)
    Readable and mostly clean, but there’s redundancy and purple abstraction—key phrases repeat without adding pressure (“harmony untamed,” “frostbitten hope”). Several lines tell what the images already imply, dulling momentum. Figurative language is safe but mixed at times, and the syntax can flatten into parallel structures. The final image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lines often double back on the same idea, and adjective stacks/purple notes creep in, softening momentum. Repetitions of key phrases function more as redundancy than pattern with payoff. Syntax remains clear, but density sometimes displaces specificity of action or cost. The final image is clean, though not sharpened by line‑level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, generally concise, and image-forward; the “brittle hush” cadence supports mood. Minor repetition and a few abstract declarations soften momentum, but clarity holds. Figurative language is consistent, with no muddled metaphors. Sentences vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is smooth with varied rhythm and clear sequencing. Repetition of key phrases (especially “misting hush”) borders on looped scaffold and reduces information density. Figurative language is controlled and not contradictory, but some sentences restate prior content. The final third retains clarity, if a touch redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean, grammatically sound lines with occasional lushness; however, paraphrase loops and repeated constructions reduce momentum. Several sentences restate the same idea of tending/mapping/reawakening without adding pressure. Figurative language is controlled and not contradictory, but density sometimes approaches purple. The final image reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are clean and grammatical, with a pleasing rhythm, but repetition (“vitalize,” “luminous absence,” “cipher”) and near-paraphrase loops dull momentum. Abstraction sometimes supplants concrete texture, blurring impact. Density is decent, yet several sentences do the same job. The final third maintains clarity but doesn’t sharpen language under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft is clear and grammatical, but purple tendencies and paraphrase loops (“hush of cosmic possibility,” recurrent “the locksmith…”) sap momentum. Figurative density is high without patterned payoff, and several sentences restate stakes already established. The click and drift beats are clean. Trimming redundancies would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is evocative with strong sensory choices but occasionally drifts toward redundancy and purple tint. Recycled openings and paraphrase loops (“She knew… She was determined… She felt…”) slow momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent, yet high‑level abstractions sometimes substitute for scene pressure. Rhythm varies but lacks a decisive tightening at the climax to propel closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are generally clear and textured, with purposeful sensory selections and minimal mechanical clutter. Some repetition (“the hush,” restated motivations) and mild purple tendencies slow momentum. A few sentences tell what the images already imply, reducing density. The final third remains legible and clean, though the prose could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line‑level craft exhibits repetition and paraphrase loops (“weave,” “essence,” “color of wonder,” “radiant hush”) that reduce information density. Figurative language saturates most sentences, creating purple overgrowth in lieu of propulsion. Syntax patterns recur, and several sentences restate the same content with new adjectives. Momentum lags despite clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft is clean but repetitive; several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (silence accumulating; needle glinting), creating momentum drag. Modifiers stack into purple patches without adding new information, and cadence often defaults to similar structures. The loops persist into the final third, softening the closure image’s impact. Cutting redundancy and varying syntax would markedly lift propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and few errors, but paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing (“more than met the eye,” “secrets hidden in plain sight”) dilute intensity. Information density could tighten, and metaphor stacks repeat without new angles. Momentum is steady but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear, sensory‑dense, and mostly economical; images do more than one job. Minor repetition and aphoristic turns create slight drag in places, but momentum largely holds. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled. The final lines resolve via charged image rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean and largely clear, but paraphrase loops and generalized modifiers (“mystical nexus,” “otherworldly hum,” “charged with electricity”) dilute force. Figurative density clusters without escalation payoff, and several sentences restate prior content. Momentum sags in the middle due to reiterated intent statements. Stronger verb choice and cut scaffolding would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clear, mostly clean, and readable, but leans on scaffold and near‑duplicates (“sense of peace,” “gentle,” “soft”) with paraphrase echoes. Figurative burden is light, yet diction trends generic at peaks (“poignant beauty,” “enduring power”). Momentum drifts in descriptive loops. Still serviceable line by line.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line‑level craft is clean but leans purple and repetitive (“spooled wholeness,” “empty spaces remembered,” “dusty starlight”), creating mild loop and density drag. Figurative language often stacks without adding new pressure. Momentum softens in reflective passages that restate premise. Still, sentences are grammatical and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear with steady momentum and selective imagery; sentence rhythms vary enough to avoid drumbeat. Occasional redundancy and mild abstraction (“an otherworldly light,” “unique skill”) soften edge and density. Figurative language is tasteful and coherent, though not especially surprising. The final image lands cleanly without purple stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are clean and sensorily specific, with purposeful repetition of motifs. Some scaffold and cadence loops (“As…” sentence starters; repeated “the scratch of their pen”) slightly dull propulsion. Figurative language remains legible; no muddled metaphors. Information density is decent, though a few sentences restate mood without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentence mechanics are clean and the imagery is often striking. There are paraphrase/echo loops and stacked modifiers (“hauntingly bright,” “soft hush,” “glittering frost”) that edge toward overwriting. Momentum softens in descriptive redundancies, but clarity holds. Information density is adequate without precise, pressure-synced propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean lines with occasional evocative phrases (“brambled hope,” “pulsing pathways”), generally clear syntax, and few technical slips. Some redundancy and abstract summary dampen momentum, but no major loops or figurative muddle. Information density is moderate; sentences often do one job. The final image is clear yet not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean syntax and few mechanical errors, but redundancy dulls momentum (multiple near‑duplicate sentences about hush deepening and balance). Figurative language clusters without variation, risking purple overtones. Several paraphrase loops could be cut to tighten impact. Rhythm is pleasant yet uniform, with limited propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and readable with a few strong images (ethereal glow, frost veil). There’s mild redundancy and stock phrasing, and the standout oddity (“offhandedly exact”) reads label‑ish. Momentum is maintained, though density could increase by cutting scaffolding. No major figurative muddle, but the line‑level rarely surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    Clean mechanics and readability, but paraphrase loops and stock abstractions (“sense of peace,” “purpose and direction,” “messy and beautiful place”) dilute density. Figurative language (music/melody) repeats without escalation; several sentences restate prior content. The final third relies on summary uplift rather than image‑driven propulsion. Stronger verb/noun choices and cuts would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean and often musical, with strong image craft (“refracting,” “shimmer”). Minor loop artifacts and abstraction (“sense of purpose,” “clarity”) recur, and repetition of phrases (“mindfully scattered,” “as she”) slows momentum. Figurative density stays coherent; no mixed metaphors obscure meaning. Tightening redundancies would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear and often evocative, but redundancy and template cadences recur (“The desert fortress stood resolute…” bookending, repeated sensory pairings). Some telling phrases and reiterative constructions slow momentum. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled, yet information density could be higher at the climax. Overall polished but not knife-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean syntax and punctuation; the prose flows. Yet modifiers and abstractions recur (“sense of wonder and magic,” “majestic presence”), and several lines paraphrase prior sentiment, slowing momentum. Figurative density leans purple without generating new pressure. The final assertion reads like exposition rather than image‑driven payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft shows controlled sentences and some striking images, but repetition and abstraction (“otherworldly energy,” “fabric of reality”) blunt precision. Several paraphrase-like restatements slow momentum. Figurative density is high without corresponding escalation, flirting with purple patches. The final paragraph’s clarity holds, yet sharper cuts could improve propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clean, readable lines with a steady rhythm, but repetition and scaffold (“the archivist…” sentence stems; restated stakes) reduce density. Figurative language is mild and coherent; no muddle, but some generic phrasing (“intense urge,” “secrets she had uncovered”). Momentum occasionally stalls in near-duplicate beats. The final cadence is clear but not sharply compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and purposeful with pleasing image economy and minimal scaffolding. Minor repetition and some tell-forward lines (“They believed that by doing so...”) reduce density. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Momentum holds, though a few sentences could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean sentences and few mechanical slips, but repetition and purple tendencies (“otherworldly energy,” “fabric of the universe”) dilute force. Several adjacent lines paraphrase similar content (purpose/hope reiterated). Information density dips as motifs loop rather than advance. The final cadence is clear, yet line-level tightening would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line‑level craft is lucid but veers purple and redundant (multiple iterations of “stillness/silence,” stacked modifiers like “soft, ethereal light”). Several sentences paraphrase the same emotional state without adding pressure. Figurative density is high in calm beats without earning added meaning. The final image is clear, yet scaffolding could be trimmed for potency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and largely efficient, with evocative sensory choices and minimal scaffolding. Some purple/repetitive phrasing (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “essence”) introduces mild redundancy and abstraction. Sentences pull forward without template cadences, and the bloom scene reads clearly. The final coda summarizes impact neatly, if a bit declaratively.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear with a consistent cadence, but repetition (“Lyra…” sentence starts; explanatory scaffolding) slows momentum. Some telling substitutes for vivid embodiment, especially at the realization beats. Figurative choices (“whirling silence”) are effective but underused to deepen conflict. Information density is even but could cut redundancies for sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean mechanics and clear sequencing support readability. Redundancies and mild purple tilt appear (“singular convergence,” repeated “silence… seemed”), and some sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Figurative texture is serviceable but not doing multi‑layered work. Momentum dips in reflection patches that summarize rather than pivot tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is lucid and musical, yet repetition and abstraction recur, slightly sapping momentum. Figurative density clusters without always adding new pressure. Redundancies around mission and hush could be trimmed. Still, syntax is clean and the climax reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line‑level craft is clear and rhythmic, but there’s some purple tint and redundancy (reiterated “canyon hush,” “avalanchingly quiet”). One copy edit error (“uncase”) and a few near‑duplicate sentiments slow momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, and sentences generally do multiple jobs. The density works, yet trims could heighten propulsion and reduce echo.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line‑level craft is generally clean with evocative images, but some redundancy and familiar constructions soften impact (“exhilarating and terrifying,” “the true work was just beginning”). A few paraphrase‑like reiterations of aim and method could be tightened. Figurative density stays legible and rarely muddies action. Momentum holds, if slightly cushioned by abstraction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is clean and musical but leans into repetition and paraphrase loops (“as if,” similar sentence openings) and mild purple phrasing. Several sentences restate the same idea (pendant calming, community germination) without new pressure. Still, clarity holds and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. The final cadence lands smoothly if lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.0)
    Frequent repetition (“profound truth,” “truthful lies,” “world alive with emotions”) and synonym loops slow momentum. Abstract phrasing and stacked modifiers create a soft focus that dulls impact. Many sentences restate the same insight without new pressure or image. Line‑level craft feels overwritten rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is clear and fluent, but repetition and synonym loops occur (“Through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” recurs; several sentences restate purpose). Adjective density and abstract intensifiers dilute force. Momentum holds, yet pruning could heighten precision and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean mechanics and readable cadence, with some arresting images (silk patterns “shift and writhe”). Purple notes and paraphrase‑adjacent repeats (“sweet scent,” reiterated motifs) reduce density. A few abstract formulations pad momentum. The line work is pleasant but safe, with limited compression under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line‑level repetition (“The map maker… The green glass shard…”) and paraphrase loops sap momentum. Filter‑verb stacks (“felt,” “knew,” “began to”) dull immediacy, especially in peak beats. Information density is moderate but summary‑leaning, with minimal multi‑function lines. The prose is clean but mechanically patterned and low on propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean, rhythmic lines with efficient concrete detail carry momentum for a quiet piece. Some paraphrase/adjective loops and motif reiterations (“glow,” “luminescent ache”) soften impact. Figurative language stays coherent and within the narrator’s lexicon. The prose could cut a few near‑duplicates for tighter propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics overall, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions reduce momentum (“beam slicing,” “coalescing,” “shadows” recur without new torque). One typo (“an soft”). Figurative density is moderate and coherent, yet several sentences do single duty. Line-level propulsion plateaus during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lines are generally clear and polished, with vivid yet controlled imagery. Some redundancy and adjective stacking (“soft, pulsing glow,” “valley‑mist wonder,” repeated “iridescent”) create minor purple overtones and momentum drag. Sentence patterns trend similar, producing a lulling cadence. The final paragraph reiterates prior insights rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong image economy overall, yet there are paraphrase/echo loops (“The storm may have passed” repeats; several moonlight affirmations) that blunt momentum. Figurative density stays legible, but some lines explain what images already show. Sentence rhythms lean uniform in stretches, muting propulsion in the middle. The final third’s repetition slightly dulls the closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Readable with clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and intensifier repetition (“pulsing,” “gentle,” “hope,” “beacon”) flatten momentum. Figurative language clusters without fresh turns, trending purple and redundant. Information density is moderate; some lines restate stakes rather than advance them. The closure image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences are clean and grammatical with decent rhythm, but there’s scaffolding and repetition (“as unobtrusive,” “whispers,” multiple time‑strike beats) and some tell-y summary. Information density is moderate; several lines paraphrase prior content without adding pressure. Figurative language stays safe, avoiding muddle but also avoiding surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean and readable with some evocative lines, but it leans on abstractions and light paraphrase loops (“tenuous absolution,” “beauty and wonder”) rather than fresh image under pressure. Sentences are balanced but rhythmically safe. Information density is fair; some repetition could be cut for momentum. No major artifacts, just mild genericity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished and image-rich, with recurring motifs (“quartz hush,” “mist,” “luminous”) creating cohesion. Some purple lean and paraphrase loops dilute momentum (“as she worked…” recurrences; frequent generalities). Figurative density stays legible but occasionally feels redundant. Mechanics are clean and the final line resolves image-first.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and clarity, but line‑level freshness is limited: repeated beats (“her heart quickened”), abstractions (“tension was palpable”), and summary claims. Some redundancy in restating the mission and The Shadow’s impact. Rhythm is steady yet safe, with modest sensory integration doing much of the work. No major artifacts, just low‑grade cliché drag.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clean mechanics and coherent sequencing throughout. However, paraphrase loops and stock scaffolds (“she felt,” “as she”) and layered modifiers edge toward purple, dulling propulsion. Several sentences tell what is already shown, reducing density. The finale still lands, but line‑level tightening is needed for elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Readable and mostly clean, but there’s overwriting and abstraction (“auroral sorrow,” “inescapable calling”) and some paraphrase‑style reiteration of the same insight. Figurative language leans generic rather than idiosyncratic to Elara. Momentum is steady yet safe; density could be higher with tighter lines. Final image is clear but not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clean, readable sentences with some evocative turns (“palimpsest,” “misty rain continued to fall”). Repetitive scaffolds (“As she…,” “The…”) and summary loops slightly dull momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, but density and propulsion are mid‑range. Final lines are clear but could compress and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some luminous images, but leans into redundancy (“glistened,” “symphonies of truth”) and declarative scaffolding. Figurative language trends toward generality rather than precise, embodied detail. Momentum softens due to loops and summary. Still, clarity survives and the cadence is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops reduce momentum (e.g., consecutive sentences reassert “contain chaos/miniaturize” without new pressure). Figurative language leans on vague intensifiers rather than precise verbs; mechanics of action are glossed. Rhythm is steady but monotonous, limiting propulsion. Clean grammar, but density is diluted by scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clear and grammatical, but scaffold and synonym loops appear (“tranquility,” “hum of morning activity,” repeated explanations). Figurative language is safe; the “sandstorm calm” line feels imported rather than grown. Momentum dips with tell‑heavy passages summarizing investigation and emotion. Information density is moderate without sharp compression.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean mechanics and clarity, but there’s paraphrase and motif reiteration that create mild loops. Figurative density is steady and occasionally repetitive without new information. Rhythm is serviceable, with limited syntactic variation. The final beats are clear but not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences and legible sequencing, but scaffold and light synonym loops appear (reasserting serenity, glow, silence). Figurative density is moderate and safe; propulsion sags in the mid‑tunnels passage. Repeated structures and generic abstractions (“mysterious forces”) blunt peak beats. The final image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level turn.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level craft shows repetition and synonym loops (“silence,” “hush,” “tranquil”) without new pressure, creating drag. Several phrases verge on purple or tautological (“tranquil blaze,” “smoothed hush”), blurring sense. Sentences often duplicate function across adjacent lines. Momentum softens in the midsection as figurative density outweighs progression.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean, grammatical lines with occasional cliché (“twinkling lights,” “magical glow”). Some paraphrase-like redundancy and summary patches dampen momentum. Information density is moderate; sentences often do one job. The final image lands clearly but without a sharpened, line‑level charge.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.7)
    Line-level craft shows paraphrase loops and synonym churn (“whispers,” “resonance,” “velvet,” “memory” recur without added nuance), creating drag. Figurative density leans purple without fresh vehicles; several sentences restate the same turn. Information density is modest, and momentum slackens in the middle reflection. The final image is clear but dulled by prior redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft shows polish but leans into repetition and paraphrase loops (“both faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct” recurs in idea and phrasing). Many sentences share similar stems and stacked modifiers, dulling propulsion. Figurative density is high without consistent escalation payoff. Clarity holds, but momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is musical and image‑rich, but it overuses reiterated phrases and near‑duplicate beats, creating paraphrase loops that dilute momentum. Figurative density remains coherent yet occasionally leans purple. Several sentences restate functionally similar developments (“she sang…the shell whispered…the hum…”) without added pressure. Line‑level tightening would sharpen the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line‑level writing is clean and often musical, but redundancy and purple drift recur (“borrowed starlight,” “ethereal,” stacked “The…” openings). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas, softening momentum. Figurative density is high without always sharpening stakes. The final cadence is clear but could be tighter and less expository.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level clarity is solid, but redundancy dulls momentum (repeated invocations of “hidden patterns,” “fireflies danced,” “soothing/serenade”). Modifiers pile up and verge on purple in places without adding new pressure. Sentences often restate mood rather than advance it. Still, syntax is clean and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear and coherent, but repetition and scaffolding (“As she walked,” “As she worked,” “As she continued”) dull momentum. Several lines summarize where specificity could carry pressure, and figurative texture is generic. Information density is acceptable; line‑level risks are minimal. Final image lands, though diction is familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.0)
    Significant paraphrase loops and summary repetition (“the visionary knew,” “as the days passed,” “the prophet’s message”) slow momentum. Figurative diction is safe and sometimes vague, with stacked abstractions and few vivid particulars. Sentences often do one job and repeat content across adjacent lines. Line-level variety and compression are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is fluent and musical, but redundancy and adjective-stacking dilute impact (“positively wistful air,” repeated construction with “As…”). Some paraphrase-sum lines tell what images already convey, softening momentum. Still, sentences generally do more than one job and the final cadence lands cleanly. Trimming summary assertions would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Readable and mostly clean, but paraphrase loops and adjective stacking (“ethereal” recurrences; similar creak images) slow propulsion. Figurative density sometimes outpaces pressure, edging toward purple. Information density is modest; several sentences restate purpose or mood. The final image is clear, yet the line‑level lacks compression and sharpened verbs that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean grammar and clear sequencing, but line‑level redundancy and template cadence reduce energy (“The mapper knew…,” “She stood…,” “As she…” cycles). Many sentences restate intent without adding pressure or image. Figurative texture is serviceable yet safe; few lines do more than one job. The final paragraph lands cleanly but repeats earlier assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line‑level craft is clear and mostly clean, but repetition (“lantern’s light,” “reverberate,” “watchfully calm”) creates paraphrase loops. Abstractions (“memories… untangle,” “sense of liberation”) are favored over concrete action in peak beats. Figurative density stays moderate, avoiding muddle, yet momentum is dulled by summary phrasing. Trim and sharpen would heighten charge.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and readable cadence, but redundancy and purple-ish clusters dilute momentum (e.g., stacked modifiers and repeated motifs without new pressure). Several lines tell what’s already implied. Figurative language is safe and sometimes mixed toward the generic. Information density is adequate, not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and template openings (“As she…,” “Throughout…”) slow momentum. Abstractions outnumber concrete, embodied moves at key beats. Figurative density is moderate but often generic, reducing sharpness. Final third retains redundancy, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clear with some evocative lines, yet repetition (“the numbers… appeared everywhere,” “echo…”) and synonym loops reduce momentum. Several statements paraphrase the same idea (obsession, void, recurrence) without adding pressure. Figurative language is controlled but not particularly fresh; some clichés creep in. Line‑level economy could be tightened to heighten propulsion and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean sentences with a smooth cadence, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions (“weighted breath before reply,” “glinting like shards”) accumulate. Figurative density sometimes turns purple, softening edge and momentum. Still, clarity holds and action remains traceable. Tighter cuts could heighten charge.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level has clear sentences and some strong images, but repetition and abstraction recur (“sound of approaching endings,” “fragile/beautiful world”), creating slight purple overtones. A few paraphrase loops restate realizations without adding pressure, and modifiers occasionally substitute for concrete action. Momentum holds, yet density could rise with sharper, less generalized phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line work is clean but repetitive, with paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing that dilute impact (“gentle persuasion,” “intersubjective understanding,” restated realizations). Figurative density is steady yet safe; few sentences do double‑duty under pressure. Momentum stalls in late reiterations of the thesis. Strong images exist, but scaffolding remains.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level craft is clean but over‑reliant on repeated phrases (“echo of wisdom,” “whisperfield calm”) and near‑duplicate sentiments, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density sometimes turns purple and static rather than advancing pressure. Momentum stalls in places where sentences restate interior calm. The final third repeats prior beats rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences with clear imagery, but there’s paraphrase looping and scaffold (“The air was filled…”, “As she…”, repeated serenity formulations). Some purple drift and redundancy dull momentum. Information density is moderate; lines often do single duty. The final image is serviceable yet unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line‑level craft is clean, with strong sensory economy and minimal scaffolding. A few near‑loops and adjective echoes (silence/hush reiterated; “sonically reflective” repeated) slightly blunt momentum. Syntax varies, and images carry multiple jobs. The final image is clear and un-muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean sentences with consistent rhythm and clear sequencing; images pull their weight. Some conceptual redundancy (“the hush…,” “tidal longing”) and thematic restatement slow momentum. Figurative language remains coherent; purple tendencies are restrained. The final image is crisp and well-lined.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Noticeable paraphrase loops and motif reiteration (“luminous ache,” “harness the ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”) create redundancy. Figurative language trends purple and abstract, reducing information density. Momentum flattens when key beats are summarized rather than dramatized. Clarity holds, but the line‑level lacks compression and fresh turns.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean mechanics and clear sequencing, but there’s paraphrase looping and purple drift (frequent abstractions, repeated modifiers). Several sentences do one job where two would serve density, and motifs are reiterated rather than developed. The closure image is clear but somewhat cushioned by familiar phrasing. Overall readable, not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but repetition (“clockwork automaton key”) and paraphrase loops slow momentum. Abstract statements (“underlying order of the universe”) blunt image‑driven energy. Information density is fair; few lines do double duty. The final image is clear if low‑voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are clean and readable, but there’s redundancy (“the changeling’s baby tooth still in hand” recurs; nostalgia/innovation is reiterated). Abstractions and modifiers often substitute for concrete action, reducing momentum. Figurative language is restrained but also safe; information density is moderate. Tightening loops and sharpening images would lift propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Line-level craft shows competence but suffers from repetition and purple echoing (“soft,” “gentle,” “bloom,” “luminescence,” “misty veil”). Several paraphrase loops restate the same sentiment without new pressure, particularly in the final third. Figurative choices are safe and duplicative rather than fresh; information density could be higher. The closure image is clear, but the language leading to it is over-cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clear and mostly economical, with pleasing images (“honeyed hush,” “icicle pattern”). Redundancies and familiar constructions recur, especially in the ending, softening impact. Figurative language is controlled, but a few abstractions flatten momentum. Overall competent line craft with room to sharpen specificity and cut summary phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line‑level density is undermined by loops and purple tendencies (synonym drift, repeated “swirl,” and abstract nouns). Many sentences restate similar states without new pressure. Figurative language is frequent without sharpening causality. Momentum stalls in reflective churn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clean and readable with image‑driven texture. Some redundancy (“gathering hush,” “essence,” “forgotten songs”) and paraphrase‑like affirmations slightly slow momentum. Figurative language is safe, not muddled, and mechanics are sound. Line‑level density supports mood but rarely does double duty to advance conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    Vivid lines and sensory specificity are strong, but repetition and synonym loops (“stillness,” “held its breath,” “glowed”) dull momentum. Some purple phrasing and summary statements appear in high‑pressure beats, slightly blurring edge and urgency. Clarity remains intact, yet the prose would improve with cuts to redundancies. Information density is decent but not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level writing is clean with occasional lovely phrasing and sensuous detail. There is redundancy (“as he worked...”) and a tendency toward purple, generalized abstraction in the middle blocks. The rhythmic variety is moderate; several sentences echo structure and content. Momentum softens due to summary and reiteration of the same moods.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean, but there’s noticeable redundancy and abstraction (“weights of different burdens,” “balance” recur without new pressure). Occasional stock metaphors (“ripples on a still pond”) and decorative modifiers soften propulsion. Figurative density is moderate and coherent, if sometimes ornamental. Momentum is gentle rather than driving.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean sentences and pleasant rhythm, with purposeful sensory detail. Some paraphrase loops and abstraction (“harvest lessons,” “hauntingly practical”) reduce density, and repeated constructions soften propulsion. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, but momentum stalls in mid‑paragraph reiterations. The final image lands despite modest line‑level redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean syntax and coherence, but redundancy (“testament,” “fractured stillness,” “regret”) and summary‑leaning lines reduce momentum. Figurative density occasionally trends purple without adding pressure. The final image is clear, yet paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing sap charge. Overall readable but not razor‑tight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    Readable, but there’s paraphrase looping and intensifier churn (hope/possibility/rebirth repeats) that saps momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than precise; many lines restate rather than advance. Limited sentence‑rhythm variety and template openings (“As the…,” “As she…”) create a drumbeat. The final third leans on telling, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft is clean and image-rich, but repetition and intensifier stacking create mild purple overgrowth. Several phrases recur without new pressure, and some metaphors feel ornamental rather than functional. Momentum sags in reflective summaries near the end. Syntax and grammar remain sound.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean mechanics, but repetition (“serene upheaval,” “silence of the morning radio,” “thoughtfully clear,” “hindsight clarity”) creates paraphrase loops and slight purple tilt. Information density is adequate; some lines restate mood without adding pressure. Momentum drags in mid‑beats where imagery clusters without new consequence. Final image is clear despite the over‑lyric sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean, mostly precise lines with strong sensory detail; minimal errors. Redundancies (fog, hush, lapping) recur without added pressure, and modifiers pile up at times. Cadence varies modestly but trends toward sameness. Information density is fair, yet some sentences restate mood rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vivid, musical lines with good sensory density, though some redundancy and adjective stacking slow momentum (“vividly descriptive,” “morbid perfume,” reiterations of silence/shadow). A few paraphrase loops summarize feelings already embodied. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat, and the final image is clean. Trim could heighten propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean mechanics, but line‑level shows repetition and overwriting (“quaking reverie,” “mechanical heartbeat” reiterated). Template cadence and paraphrase loops slow momentum, especially in the middle. Figurative density occasionally blurs freshness rather than sharpening specifics. Readable, yet not lean.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and sensory texture, but redundancy (“as the night wore on,” “unyielding compassion”) and abstract assertion slow momentum. Figurative density borders on decorative in places without adding pressure. Sentences often do one job where two were possible. The line’s music is agreeable more than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing; information density is adequate. Some repetition and adjective-led phrasing (“luminous,” “forgotten,” “whispers”) soften propulsion. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid purple, but a few phrases feel templated. No major line-level artifacts or clarity breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level craft is clean but leans into redundancy and purple abstraction (“infinite beauty,” “otherworldly energy”) without fresh turns. Several sentences reiterate the same idea across adjacent lines, slowing momentum. Figurative clusters (flowers/petals/echoes) are coherent but overused. Rhythm is smooth yet uniform, muting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing; imagery is coherent. Repetitive stems (“The carver…”) and summary abstractions near the end slow momentum. Occasional purple-ish phrasing and paraphrase-like reiteration dampen density. Overall readable but not sharply cut.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean mechanics and coherent flow, but repetition and paraphrase loops occur (“pendulum bob,” “incremental absolution,” “emerge into the light”). Figurative language is safe and sometimes generic, with limited multi‑tasking lines. Momentum survives, yet density could be higher with tighter cuts. The final third reiterates ideas rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean sentences, steady cadence, and vivid nouns anchor the prose. Some redundancy and decorative phrasing (“uncharted echoes” repeated; lush modifiers) slightly slow momentum. The “chess clock” and “velveteen gloom” are strong images but can feel over-curated. Overall clarity holds with moderate density.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clean sentences and some strong images, but there’s notable redundancy and conceptual repetition (spire as constraint, poised pen, probabilities swirling). Figurative density leans purple in places without new information. Cadence lacks variation, and several adjacent lines paraphrase one another, sapping momentum. The final image is clear but not sharpened by line‑level compression.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line‑level craft is polished and mostly efficient, with good verb choice and sensory layering. There is some paraphrase/redundancy (mist, “thistled calm,” glow/dial) and a slight purple tendency in stacked modifiers. The crescendo scene stays clear and uncluttered. Overall momentum holds, but tighter cuts would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetition (“mirage of safety,” “somber,” “powder”) and paraphrase loops reduce momentum, and several clunky phrases/typos dent polish. Figurative language is safe and sometimes mixed or generic; moralizing in the final third dulls the closing image’s charge. Sentences often restate similar points rather than layering new pressure. Readable but not distilled.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong sensory density and clean syntax, but repetition and paraphrase loops appear (“rationally rebellious,” recurring sentence openings). Figurative language is safe and sometimes generic, with mild redundancy that slows propulsion. Momentum flags in middle reflection patches before the ending image re-centers focus. Overall legible, if occasionally over-insisted.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean and readable with strong imagery, but redundancy and abstract summaries recur (“a way of life,” “a shared experience of beauty,” “a beacon of hope”). Figurative density edges purple in places and loops ideas without deepening them. Momentum softens due to paraphrase-like reiterations. The final image is clear but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clean syntax and mostly precise sentences, but redundancy and mild overwriting sap momentum (“reverence” appears twice in close proximity; several lines paraphrase prior claims). Intensifiers and abstractions substitute for concrete complication at times. The prose carries atmosphere yet could cut 10–15% to sharpen force.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level clarity is good, but repetition (“The toll keeper…” stems) and some ornamental phrasing slow momentum. Figurative language is pleasant yet sometimes generic, reducing information density. Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony. No major artifacts, but tightening would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are clean and largely fluent, but abstractions and repeated formulations (“hush,” “energy,” “alive”) dilute precision. Some paraphrase-like restating slows momentum (“sensed,” “realized,” “understood”). Imagery is competent yet sometimes leans purple without adding actionable detail. No grammatical issues, but density could do more work per sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft is clear and readable, with a few pleasing images (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”). However, paraphrase loops and template stems (“The statue…”) recur, and key beats are told rather than shown. Figurative density occasionally veers toward generic uplift. Momentum is steady but seldom propelled by syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops recur (“the stairs seemed to...,” “I felt...”), and several sentences restate premise without new pressure. Figurative density is moderate but sometimes clichéd (“rabbit hole,” “fabric of reality”), softening precision. Momentum drags in the middle as similar beats reappear with near‑synonyms. The final image is clear, but the path there is padded.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elegant lines, but repetition and ornamental phrasing (“saffron quiet,” “smog-choked,” “ethereal glow”) recur without new pressure, creating mild loop drag. Figurative density sometimes outpaces action, softening propulsion. Clarity stays intact, yet the line‑level economy could tighten. The final paragraph reiterates achieved sentiments rather than adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing, with occasional purple notes (“rosewater dread”) and repetition of phrases about “stories beneath the surface.” Some telling scaffolds could be cut to sharpen momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though a few redundancies dampen charge in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    Readable, but repetition and synonym loops (“latent radiance,” “beyond fate’s design,” “as he…”) sap momentum. Figurative density skews purple without fresh vehicles, and several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same beat. Syntax is often uniform, producing a drumbeat cadence during high‑pressure moments. Final paragraphs reiterate transformation instead of sharpening image or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line level shows redundancy and cliché (“siren’s call,” “black as coal,” “gentle breeze”), plus paraphrase loops that don’t add pressure. Figurative density sometimes muddies rather than sharpens. Mechanics are clean, but momentum stalls under repeated stems and intensifiers. The climax image is clear but not cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elegant lines and strong imagery, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions (“a tiny, shining jewel,” “restless euphony,” multiple near‑duplicate closing beats) slow momentum. Figurative density occasionally turns purple, diluting impact. Rhythm is pleasant yet could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean, readable lines with clear action order, but there’s scaffold and synonym loops (“felt a sense of dread,” repeated “watchers… looming/silence”). Template cadence (“She [verb]… She [verb]…”) reduces propulsion in peak beats. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, yet the repetition dulls momentum. Tightening redundant sentences would markedly improve pace.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    There are nice textures (“morbid perfume,” “skeletal fingers”), but paraphrase loops and reiterations dilute momentum (“rescue truth,” “noble lies,” and “illuminated letter” are repeated without new pressure). Figurative language is serviceable but occasionally purple and static. Sentences often restate purpose instead of advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft suffers from repetition and abstract phrasing; several adjacent sentences restate mood without advancing pressure. Figurative language leans purple and generic at key beats, blunting impact. Information density is moderate but not propulsive. The final third repeats motifs rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clean mechanics and clear sequencing, but paraphrase loops and filter‑verb stacks (“felt,” “began to”) reduce density and propulsion. Occasional purple leaning and reiteration (“reclaimed stillness,” “alternative hypothesis”) sap momentum. The final image is clear, yet line‑level energy could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    Line-level craft is polished but occasionally overwrought, with stacked modifiers and echoing phrasing (“luminous torment,” recurrent glow language). Syntax varies and mechanics are clean. A few paraphrase-like reiterations slow momentum. Clarity holds, yet density sometimes blurs edge and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetition and scaffold are evident (“unused potential” and “awakening” recur with minimal new information). Phrases like “intangibly tangible” and “bleak exhilaration” feel slogan-like, diluting precision. Syntax remains clear but often generic, with summarizing sentences where scene could carry weight. Information density is moderate; momentum is dampened by conceptual loops.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean and often musical, yet leans into repetitive constructions and safe abstractions (“sense of anticipation,” “soft whisper”) that could be cut for density. Occasional purple-leaning phrases and reiterations (“brilliant dimness” reprise, multiple wonder notes) slow momentum. Information flow is clear; tighter verbs and fewer near-duplicates would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line work is mostly clean and image‑rich, with strong sensory verbs and recurring objects doing double duty. Some paraphrase loops and scaffold (“As she…”) and a few purple stretches lessen propulsion. Figurative language holds together with minimal muddle. Pacing remains readable, though momentum softens mid‑section.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Polished sentences with rhythmic control, but paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing recur (“mist swirling,” “delicate balance,” “weight”). Imagery clusters without evolving pressure, slightly dulling momentum. Clarity is never lost; density could be higher with more concrete action. Minimal error-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clean grammar and clarity, but noticeable paraphrase loops and thematic repetition dampen momentum (“backlash of regrets,” “align heart and actions,” “when expectations collapse” recur). Figurative language is safe and familiar; information density could be higher. Rhythm is steady yet monotonous, with minimal sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    Line‑level craft is clean but padded by paraphrase loops and purple modifiers; several sentences restate similar feelings (“jaded wonder,” “otherworldly glow,” “journey beginning”). Template stems sap propulsion, and figurative language rarely adds new information. Momentum drifts because description often repeats function without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and often musical, but relies on repeated abstractions and intensifiers (“cosmic,” “otherworldly,” “kaleidoscope”), edging toward purple. Some paraphrase redundancy appears in describing the metamorphosis and the orchard’s glow. Information density is adequate, and sequencing is clean. Greater specificity and fresher figurative choices would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lush prose delivers vivid sensory work, but paraphrase loops and template stems introduce drag. Repetitions of construction and key phrases (“The cartomancer…”, “cloudbound repentance”) reduce propulsion. Figurative choices mostly cohere, yet density occasionally tips purple. Clean mechanics and clarity keep it afloat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line‑level craft is clear and often musical, but paraphrase loops and purple echoes appear (“faint shimmer of long‑dried tears” recurs; “felt the weight… settling” repeats). Several sentences do similar work without new pressure, slowing momentum. Figurative density occasionally dilutes precision, especially near the climax. The final cadence is clean, if a touch ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetition of key phrases (“whispering hush,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”) becomes loop-like, especially in the final third, reducing momentum and freshness. Abstractions and near-duplicate sentiments cluster (“drawn to the mysterious,” “unusual and the unknown”), producing scaffolding. The prose is clean but often tells where image could carry weight. Musicality is present but marred by redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level craft is clear but prone to redundancy and intensifier loops (e.g., “new era,” “whispers,” “glow” recurrences without new pressure). Figurative density edges purple without deepening sense. Momentum remains, yet several sentences paraphrase earlier claims rather than advancing. Final third leans on abstract summary over image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean but repetitive: similar sentence stems and abstract phrasing recur (“sacred patterns,” “fabric of reality”). Occasional purple tilts and paraphrase‑like reiterations dampen propulsion. Imagery is clear, just over‑declared.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong, musical lines with purposeful repetition and a clean final cadence. Some synonym loops and abstraction (“cartography of scars,” “hidden patterns”) recur without adding new pressure. Figurative density skews high but remains coherent. Readability and momentum hold.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean but leans on repetition and summary (“dignified chaos,” “hidden overture,” reiterated serenity vs. clash). Key beats are told rather than shown, sapping momentum. Figurative language is safe but generic, and several adjacent lines paraphrase the same content. Information density and syntactic variety are moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line‑level clarity is solid, but paraphrase loops (“rebuild,” “beacon of hope,” reiterated purpose) slow momentum. Figurative choices occasionally turn purple or familiar, dulling precision. Information density is moderate with summary dominating action. Cadence varies, yet peak beats could cut deeper with concrete, priced detail.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is often striking but occasionally tips into purple or redundancy (recurrent “flickering,” “mist,” and platitudinal clusters like “possibility and promise,” “mystery and wonder”). Minor paraphrase loops and stock constructions sap momentum in the final third. Syntax remains clear; information density is decent. Tightening modifiers and trimming generic abstractions would lift the line work.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line‑level craft is clear but padded by paraphrase loops and stock phrasing (repeated “warm sunlight,” “gentle hum,” assertions of urgency without new pressure). Figurative language trends toward purple without advancing causality. Sentences often restate prior content rather than deepen it, flattening momentum. The final third retains readability but not compression.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic with purposeful imagery; sensory details carry weight. However, paraphrase loops and repeated sentence stems (“He [verb]…”) slightly slow momentum. Figurative language remains coherent, with few purple excesses. Line‑level economy could tighten by trimming reiterations in the final third.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant conceptual looping and redundancy. The core ideas of "gradual change," "incremental steps," and "accumulated patterns" are restated multiple times using slightly different phrasing, which stalls momentum and dulls the impact. This paraphrasing of the central thesis across several paragraphs makes the writing feel padded and demonstrates a lack of trust in the story's images to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a lack of syntactic variety and a reliance on repetitive sentence structures ("She felt...", "The canyon was..."). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, creating conceptual loops that slow momentum, particularly in the final third's reflective summary. The heavy use of abstract nouns (harmony, resonance, purpose, stillness) in place of concrete embodiment dulls the narrative's immediacy and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a lack of concision and a reliance on abstract summary over concrete action. Phrases like "reflected the depth of Eli's emotions" tell instead of show, and there are repetitive sentence stems ("The survivor watched," "The survivor sat down"). These prose artifacts, combined with stock metaphors like "ripples on a pond," slow the momentum and dull the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and grammatically sound. Its primary weakness is a lack of propulsion, stemming directly from the summary-based structure. Sentences often report on events rather than rendering them, and there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy ("The weary undertaker, worn down..."). The rhythm is steady but lacks the syntactic variety needed to build tension or reflect the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but lacks momentum due to a reliance on abstract nouns and summary over dramatized action. Several sentences exhibit paraphrase-loops, restating an idea for emphasis rather than advancing it (e.g., the arbor as a "symbol" and a "physical manifestation"). This tendency to explain dilutes the information density and slows the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language ("surreal canvas," "ethereal light," "pilgrim of sparks," "unfurl like tiny stars") that can feel decorative rather than propulsive. Some phrasing, like "chambers of your own heart," veers into cliché. While generally clean, the density of descriptors occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from significant overwriting, relying heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual summaries ("the unfolding narrative of time," "the intricate patterns that underlay the passage of time"). Many sentences tell rather than show, using scaffold phrases like "Elian felt" or "they realized" to describe internal shifts instead of dramatizing them. This clogs the momentum and dulls the immediacy of the otherwise potent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive sentence structures and conceptual loops, especially in the latter half. Phrases like "a testament to," "a reminder of," and "a symbol of" are used as boilerplate scaffolding. The final paragraphs repeatedly rephrase the same abstract ideas about hope, resilience, and the future, creating a sluggish, didactic rhythm that drains the story of its narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, but it is hampered by moments of redundancy and a tendency to summarize in the final third. Phrases like "eerie, ethereal glow... otherworldly light" are overwrought. The final paragraphs lose momentum by explaining the story's theme and impact, rather than letting the climactic image of the humming prototype carry the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a high density of generic, romantic adjectives ("fleeting golden," "soft, ethereal," "quietly savvy"). There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different words, which slows momentum. This accumulation of text artifacts, particularly the reliance on clichés to evoke a magical atmosphere, significantly dulls the narrative's impact and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is overwrought and repetitive, dulling momentum. There are multiple paraphrase loops, such as restating the world's awakening and Elian's role in it. The density of figurative language ("morbid perfume that clung to the skin like a damp shroud") often slows the pace without adding significant new information, and repeating the phrase "weighty lightness" diminishes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is hampered by recurring scaffold sentences ("I was," "I felt") and paraphrase loops ("I was determined to decrypt it... I was determined to outwit the encryption"). Word choice tends toward cliché ("shaken me to my core," "shiver run down my spine") and abstraction over concrete detail. This lack of line-level propulsion and density makes the narrative feel sluggish and overly summarized, particularly during the pivotal code-breaking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting that undermines its otherwise evocative quality. The phrase "flaking gold leaf booklet" is repeated five times, and the reliance on "as if" constructions (nine instances) becomes a distracting narrative crutch that weakens the story's authority. These template cadences and repetitions create loops that stall momentum and prevent the line-level craft from reaching a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetition and paraphrase loops, which severely damages momentum and dilutes the impact of the conclusion. Key phrases ("remarkably composed," "second chance program") and the core thematic realization are restated multiple times with only minor variations. This creates a sluggish, inefficient narrative that explains itself repeatedly rather than trusting in the power of a single, well-crafted statement or image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and template-cadence artifacts. The phrase "resonant hush" is used three times, and the stem "sense of..." appears seven times, creating a monotonous rhythm that dulls momentum. This looping of abstract concepts ("mistrust and secrecy melting away") in slightly different phrasing replaces sharp, concrete progression with a circling summary, a critical flaw in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.5)
    While often elegant, the prose is undermined by significant structural repetition and scaffolding. Multiple sentences are built on the "a testament to," "a reminder of," or "a symbol of" template. The phrase "a truth that was both simple and profound" is repeated verbatim. This looping and abstract summary language, especially in the final third, dulls momentum and clarity, obscuring the story's concrete images with unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum. A pervasive template cadence ("As she worked... As she tightened... As she watched...") makes the rhythm monotonous and mechanical. The story also leans on clichés ("kaleidoscope of colors and lights," "coursing through her veins like liquid fire"), which, combined with the structural repetition, severely hampers the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is hampered by repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "As the lanterns flickered" is used as a crutch, and several sentences paraphrase the one preceding them (e.g., the redundant explanation for her inspiration). This creates a sluggish rhythm and reduces information density, obscuring the story's strong atmospheric potential with imprecise and looped phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual repetition. Phrases like "weight of the swallowed truth" and "auroral sorrow" are conceptually dense but lack sensory grounding. Several sentences function as pure summary of the theme, which stalls momentum, particularly in the final third where the story pivots from showing to telling ("In the end, Aria's findings were not a fixed or definitive answer...").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the prose contains some evocative imagery, it is marred by repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "The explorer..." stem, which creates a monotonous, template-like cadence. There are also moments of overwriting that feel slightly clichéd, such as "the weight of the swallowed truth was finally beginning to reveal itself." These line-level issues create drag and detract from the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely hampered by extensive repetition and paraphrase loops. Key phrases ("chronicle keeper," "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace") are repeated to the point of becoming robotic scaffolding. Sentences frequently restate the content of the previous one, as in "to bear witness... To witness change without judgment was their motivation," which critically drains momentum and dilutes the story's atmospheric power.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but is weakened by repetitive sentence structures, particularly the recurring "As [event], [character action]..." template, which creates a monotonous rhythm. Several phrases verge on cliché ("celestial ballet," "threads of the evening's tranquility," "wash over her"). These prose artifacts dull the momentum and specificity of key moments, preventing the story from achieving a higher degree of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by pervasive text artifacts that would require heavy editing before publication. The story suffers from significant paraphrase-looping and synonym churn (e.g., repeating the idea of "uncovering secrets" and the image of the clutched tapestry fragment). This repetition, combined with a templated cadence ("As she pondered... As Emilia read on... As the hours passed..."), creates momentum drag and gives the piece a mechanical feel, dulling the impact of its strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is critically flawed by extensive and mechanical repetition of key phrases ("spycraft microdot film specs," "transpose their life into a new key," "directing the flow," "mysterious lighthouse," "open secrets"). These text artifacts are not used for deliberate, patterned effect but function as scaffold, creating loops that halt momentum and give the story a robotic, checklist-like quality. This core craft issue significantly degrades the reading experience and clarity of action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and paraphrase loops. Phrases like "illuminate hidden assumptions and reveal the underlying truths" and "plumb/plumping the depths" are reused, creating redundancy that kills momentum. This synonym churn and conceptual looping makes the writing feel padded and static, undermining the narrative's forward progression and giving it a boilerplate quality despite the poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose establishes a strong rhythm, but is hampered by a reliance on abstract conceptual phrases ("chronologically homesick aura," "topography of memories") and recurring sentence structures that create a looping effect. Several passages in the latter half paraphrase earlier ideas, particularly regarding the theme of blurred reality, which slows momentum. The final emotional beats rely on stock phrasing like "heart swelled with a sense of purpose," dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant structural repetition and conceptual looping. Key phrases like "ancient clay tablet with runes" and "conquer the labyrinth of self" are repeated to the point of becoming artifacts. The final paragraph critically fails the read-aloud test, stating "her journey through the labyrinth of self complete" and then, two sentences later, "...she had conquered the labyrinth of self." This severe redundancy in a climactic moment drains the ending of its propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant vulnerability. While aiming for a lyrical quality, it suffers from repetition and scaffold-like phrasing ("The faint rustle of turning seasons," "enthrall"). Several sentences are adjacent paraphrases, such as "Aria's presence was a mirrored hush, reflecting the stillness of the cavern." The reliance on abstract, figurative language ("filament of hush," "womb, nurturing the growth") often obscures concrete action and dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is grammatically functional but is marred by significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum. There is a persistent use of a repetitive sentence template ("the storm recorder's..."), creating a monotonous rhythm. Several passages are overwritten with piled-on adjectives ("long, ominous shadows that stretched and twisted"), and abstract phrases like "layered tranquility" and "spirit begin to soar" replace concrete, specific imagery, ultimately dulling the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but weakened by repetitive sentence structures and conceptual loops. The phrase "Elara felt a sense of..." appears three times, creating a monotonous rhythm. Several adjacent sentences restate the same information, such as the vial glowing as a vessel for memories, which slows momentum. Overwriting in key moments, like the vial seeming "to symbolize the fragility and beauty of memory," explains the image instead of trusting it to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is burdened by severe repetition and paraphrase loops, which stall momentum. The near-verbatim repetition of the line about the world being a "canvas waiting to be filled" is a critical flaw. Key thematic phrases are churned to the point of becoming boilerplate, draining them of their power and making the piece read like a template. This structural redundancy significantly harms the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is evocative and strong in the opening passages, but the final third is weakened by significant repetition. The concept of the "chronic hush" being transformed is stated in three separate, near-identical paraphrase loops across different paragraphs. This redundancy dulls the impact of the closure, over-explaining the story's resolution and slowing the final momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is hampered by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Several core ideas—about the nature of her crafted emotions or her professional philosophy—are stated and then restated in slightly different terms within a short span. These artifacts dull the narrative momentum and betray a lack of concision at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    While grammatically clean, the prose leans heavily on cliché ("dissolved into the evening air," "friendship blossomed") and summary. The story suffers from "telling" over "showing," with key emotional shifts and decisions narrated abstractly ("Moved by Sophia's tale, Lena felt a desire to..."). Repetitive sentence structures ("As...") also create a monotonous rhythm that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetition and conceptual loops, particularly with phrases like "webs of kinship" and "glimmering obsidian arbor." Several sentences state the same idea in slightly different ways, slowing momentum. The final paragraphs are a cascade of summary and redundancy, demonstrating a lack of trust in the story's events to convey meaning on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it's marred by occasional flaws that disrupt momentum. A notable grammatical error ("was being sculpts time itself") breaks the flow at a key descriptive moment. Some phrases are overwrought ("accommodate the borrowed chronology"), creating moments of slight opacity where clarity and propulsion are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "mathematics of emotion," "gently inventive," and "hidden harmonies" are looped multiple times, dulling their impact. Several adjacent sentences merely paraphrase each other, creating a sluggish rhythm and low information density that significantly weakens the story's momentum and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but prone to overwriting and cliché, and it contains several paraphrase loops (e.g., describing the smile twice). The primary flaw is the final paragraph, which devolves into thematic summary and abstraction, abandoning scene-work. This scaffolding seriously damages momentum and the integrity of the closing image, reading like an authorial note to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is severely hampered by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops that kill momentum. Key ideas—such as the trellis as a guide, the leaf as a symbol, and the need for transformation—are restated multiple times in slightly different phrasing. This repetition pads the word count without adding new information or deepening the emotional impact, making the narrative feel sluggish and overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally clean but marred by repetitive phrasing and a reliance on abstract nouns to convey feeling. The phrase "haggard awe" is used twice, diminishing its impact. Several sentences follow a similar template ("The [noun] [verb]..., its [noun] seeming to..."), creating a monotonous rhythm. The primary issue is a lack of information density; many sentences state feelings or ideas that could be shown more effectively through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstraction ("unseen forces," "fabric of reality," "intricate web of energies"). This tendency to label concepts rather than render them through concrete, sensory detail keeps the narrative at a distance. There are also moments of summary where showing would be more powerful, such as "she felt her abilities expanding," which flattens the momentum of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and summary that stalls momentum. Sentences frequently tell instead of show (e.g., "She felt a spark of recognition," "Its presence sparked a sense of nostalgia"), and the story's core developments are recounted rather than dramatized. This lack of immediacy and concrete action creates a narrative distance that prevents the reader from fully engaging with the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy and paraphrase loops, repeatedly stating the mysterious nature of the vault and Emilia's motivation. Key moments, like the climax, are told via summary ("The secrets of the vault unfolded like a map") instead of being shown through concrete action and imagery. This lack of information density and reliance on abstract language ("otherworldly," "ethereal") dulls the narrative's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from overwriting and a reliance on abstract, intangible concepts ("alchemy of memory and imagination," "topography of the mind"). Several phrases feel like prompt-ese or therapeutic jargon ("sculpt space for reflection," "courageously kind determination"), creating a register drift that distances the reader. The momentum is often slowed by these ornate descriptions rather than propelled by concrete action and sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively. The piece is held back from excellence by occasional reliance on generic descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "dark power") and minor syntactic repetition that slightly flattens the rhythm in places. Overall, the craft is solid, with no major artifacts to impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally competent but is weakened by several instances of cliché ("heart quickened," "warmth spread through her chest") and overwriting ("vibrate with a deathly vitality, as if the very act of waiting was infusing it with life"). These artifacts, appearing in high-pressure beats in the story's final third, dull the impact and prevent the piece from achieving top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    While often elegant, the prose is marred by repetition and scaffold phrasing. There are clear instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing the pencil "capturing the subtleties" in two separate scenes with nearly identical phrasing. Direct statements of motive ("The stationer's motivation was...") also undercut the principle of showing, slightly weakening the overall craft despite its many strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetition and scaffolding. Key concepts ("labyrinth," "tides," "layering stories," "texture of memories") are restated in near-identical phrasing throughout, creating paraphrase loops that stall momentum. The language is clean but overly abstract, relying on conceptual nouns rather than concrete, sensory verbs and images to carry the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops. Key terms ("whispers of the past," "ephemeral compass," "universal riddle," "painted seashell") are repeated to the point of feeling mechanical. This text-artifact pattern dulls momentum and gives the story a template-like quality, reducing the information density and propulsion of the lines.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically correct but lacks momentum and specificity. It relies heavily on abstract summary ("a sense of unity and purpose," "the depth of feeling") and repetitive sentence structures. The story consistently tells rather than shows, which is a significant flaw at the line level, keeping the reader at a distance from the events and robbing the climax of its potential power.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is fatally undermined by redundancy and looping. The verbatim repetition of "The stillness of the scene was almost palpable, a dawning hush that seemed to reverberate..." is a critical flaw. Additionally, the piece is littered with paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("fleeting moment," "fleeting beauty," "transience of life"), which significantly dulls momentum and reads as unedited.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is often elegant, it suffers from redundancy and paraphrase loops, particularly in the final third. Several sentences restate the successful outcome and its symbolic meaning, which dulls the impact of the closure. For example, the drone's success is described as a "testament to her skill," then a "symbol of her craft," and finally a "demonstration of Emilia's skill," creating a loop that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is undermined by significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops and repeated phrases ("palpable silence," "subtly confident"). The reliance on a template cadence ("As she walked," "As she explored") becomes mechanical and dulls the impact of key scenes. These issues, combined with some genre clichés, prevent the prose from achieving a professional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marred by a recurring template cadence. Several sentences follow the structure "The [noun] was [description]; it was [elaboration]," (e.g., "The sound was a solitary beat...", "The pattern was not random..."). This repetition, along with conceptual paraphrasing like "The synchronization was not coincidental; it was a deliberate act," creates a prose artifact that dulls momentum and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "crystal perfume vial," "lonesome splendor," and "touches memories" are reused to the point of becoming text artifacts, dulling momentum and information density. This looping quality, especially across different paragraphs, severely hampers the line-level craft and creates a sense of reading the same beats multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from scaffold-like repetition and paraphrase loops, which severely impede momentum. Phrases like "thread the labyrinth with his own story," "chasing the hush," and "uncover the secrets/truth" are reused to the point of becoming artifacts. This redundancy, especially where similar ideas are restated in adjacent sentences, creates a sluggish pace and overwrites what could have been a taut, atmospheric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the prose can be evocative, it is severely hampered by repetition and paraphrase loops. Key phrases like "resonant awakenings," "carved stone bead," and "repay a debt" are reiterated to the point of becoming inert. The final two paragraphs in particular restate the same information multiple times, draining the closure of its momentum and demonstrating a classic scaffolding artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is clean grammatically but is severely weakened by pervasive conceptual loops and redundant phrasing. Key thematic statements like "carve a path from ruin to reverence" and "broken precedents" are repeated almost verbatim. The final few paragraphs are particularly repetitive, restating the same conclusions without adding new information or pressure. This textual artifact significantly dulls momentum and reads as unrefined scaffolding rather than deliberate, impactful prose.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding. The recurrent "Maya felt a sense of..." or "As she worked, she began to feel..." creates a monotonous, template-like cadence. This looping structure slows momentum and reduces information density, making the prose functional but uninspired.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, abstraction, and repetition. Conceptual phrases are looped, such as the multiple mentions of "discover meaning in the margins." Sentences are often dense with generic, high-level descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "pulsate with an energy all its own") instead of concrete images, which dulls momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the prose is grammatically clean, it is hindered by a reliance on abstract nouns ("wisdom," "precision," "urgency," "purpose") over concrete imagery, which keeps the narrative at a distance. There are instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences convey the same idea without adding pressure, particularly in the final paragraphs. The frequent use of a "Subject + verb" template cadence ("The embroiderer's fingers moved," "The flame seemed to dance") dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, but it is hampered by several instances of overwriting and reliance on abstract emotional summary. Phrases like "rose to a crescendo," "fever pitch," and "swirling vortex" are clichés that slightly dull the impact of the climax. Additionally, there are paraphrase-loops where emotional states are restated with different words ("unspoken apologies and unresolved conflicts," "consumed by regret and yearning") rather than deepened through action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose achieves a dreamy rhythm, it is severely hampered by recurring flaws. Paraphrase loops are common (e.g., the "unknotting" metaphor is stated twice in nearly identical terms). The story also uses a template cadence to repeatedly explain its own symbols ("The brain coral fragment... a testament to... a symbol of... a reminder of..."), which feels mechanical and overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally graceful and clear, but it suffers from minor scaffolding and redundancy. The repetition of the "lost joy" motivation in both the setup and the conclusion is a notable paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. While evocative, the language doesn't consistently achieve high information density, with some sentences summarizing what could be implied.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally evocative and clear, with strong imagery. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by phrases that lean toward cliché ("kaleidoscope of possibilities") or summarizing emotional beats rather than showing them. The ending, in particular, contains some overwritten sentiment that slightly dulls the sharpness of the final, wondrous image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is clean but suffers from significant repetition and abstract language. Several passages paraphrase the same ideas, such as the greenhouse being a hub of activity or the nature of Lyra's message. Phrases like "converging chaos of thoughts and emotions" are told rather than shown. The lack of sentence variety and a tendency towards summary over scene work creates a sluggish, declarative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative, but its momentum is impeded by noticeable repetition. The phrase "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is repeated almost verbatim in consecutive paragraphs, and words like "ensconce" and "reef-shadow joy" are reused. These loops function as prose artifacts that dull the impact of the otherwise strong imagery and create a sense of stylistic stutter rather than intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a persistent pattern of paraphrase-loops, where an idea is stated and then immediately restated with slightly different phrasing (e.g., "preserve the sound of forgotten names, to keep alive the echoes of a past"). This redundancy pads the text and slows momentum. While the language is often lovely, this structural tic prevents the line-level craft from achieving the density and propulsion required for top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but is significantly hampered by overwriting and conceptual loops. Abstract phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "threads of meaning" are repeated without adding new information, functioning as scaffolding rather than propulsive detail. This reliance on high-concept jargon in place of concrete imagery dulls the narrative momentum and makes key moments feel abstract and ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant line-level artifacts, particularly paraphrase loops and synonym churn. For instance, the creaking stones create "eerie music" and later a "soothing melody." Multiple sentences describe Kaelin's heart trembling in nearly identical terms. This repetition, combined with overwriting ("symphony of purpose"), dulls momentum and reads as unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally graceful and evocative, with strong imagery like "a blooming withering" and the "fragile dance of the dust." However, momentum occasionally slows due to abstract phrasing and conceptual restatements ("a reminder of the world beyond the bookshop, a world Emilia often felt disconnected from"). The final paragraphs become more declarative and less imagistic, which flattens their impact slightly compared to the rich texture established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is clean but marred by significant repetitive artifacts. The overuse of "I felt..." as a sentence stem creates a monotonous, scaffold-like cadence that dulls immediacy. Conceptual loops are frequent (e.g., repeating the mystery of the world or the function of the logbook), draining momentum and information density from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is marred by significant conceptual loops and repetitive phrasing. Key terms from the prompt ("luminous respite," "captivate the essence," "softly ingenious") are recycled verbatim across paragraphs, which stalls momentum and reads as scaffolding. While grammatically clean, this redundancy dulls the impact of otherwise evocative language, particularly near the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from noticeable repetition and conceptual looping that dulls its momentum. Phrases like "cheerful gloom," "transliterated emotions," and the object "crater glass" glowing are repeated almost verbatim. This creates a sense of scaffold or template-based writing rather than organic development. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea, for instance, identifying the memory and the symbols as the "key" in separate paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically sound but suffers from abstraction and conceptual redundancy. Key ideas are restated with slight variations ("ordering randomness," "strategic randomness," "calculated wilderness") creating paraphrase loops. The story relies heavily on telling and summarizing pivotal moments, such as the performance itself, rather than grounding them in concrete, propulsive action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and redundancy that slightly dull its momentum. For example, "a swirling vortex of movement that seemed to capture the cosmic verse" is a bit abstract and summary-like at a climactic moment. A few phrases feel slightly clichéd ("seep into her bones," "lost in thought"), preventing the otherwise excellent line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and scaffolding. Multiple paraphrase loops occur where adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different words. Furthermore, the reliance on template cadences, particularly the "She felt a sense of..." and "She knew that she had to..." constructions, creates a monotonous rhythm that dulls the story’s momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. The story's central idea of pain becoming a "universal language" is restated multiple times in slightly different ways, stalling momentum. The language often defaults to abstraction ("deep, abiding movement," "heart of existence") and overwrought phrasing ("hard softness") instead of grounding the experience in concrete, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but marred by abstraction and redundancy. It suffers from paraphrase loops where adjacent phrases or sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms (e.g., "test the limits of her understanding and push the boundaries of what was possible"). The reliance on high-concept, intangible nouns ("serene upheaval," "equations for hope") often substitutes for concrete, sensory detail, which slightly dulls the story's momentum and immediacy despite the vivid setting.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and paraphrase loops that stall momentum. Key phrases ("corridor echo cartographer," "film negative strip") are recycled to the point of becoming incantations rather than descriptions. The piece is laden with scaffold-like sentences that restate the same idea, such as describing the work as "not just about documenting... but about capturing the essence," a pattern that makes the writing feel padded and sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant line-level issues that impede momentum. There are numerous instances of paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same information without adding depth. Key phrases ("perceptively calm demeanor," "dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeat") are repeated verbatim, creating a looping, scaffold-like texture that feels formulaic and reduces the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by text artifacts, particularly paraphrase loops and synonym churn. For example, the clipboard is first "a symbol of his authority and a reminder of the weight of his responsibility," then soon after "a tangible representation of his commitment." This pattern of restating the same idea with different abstract words appears throughout, killing momentum and betraying a lack of confidence in the initial phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clean but weakened by redundancy and scaffolding. Several paraphrase loops occur, such as stating the character is not given to emotional displays right after showing her hide a feeling. The final section loses momentum to summary, repeatedly describing the effects of the water rather than letting the initial image resonate, creating a sluggish and repetitive cadence at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is stylistically consistent but suffers from significant overwriting and a reliance on abstract, unoriginal figurative language ("lullaby of conformity," "web of societal norms"). There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing the constraints on her in three different ways in one sentence. This lack of concision and specificity creates a dense but ultimately hollow texture that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from mild repetition and scaffolding. Phrases like "uncommonly serene atmosphere" and variations of "Amaranth felt" appear multiple times, creating a slight looping effect. There is an over-reliance on filter verbs which dulls the immediacy of key moments of inspiration. The sentence structure could benefit from more variety to enhance its rhythm and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but weakened by repetition and redundancy, particularly in the final third. There are several paraphrase loops, such as describing the structures as a "testament" to an idea in two very similar sentences. This repetition dulls the momentum and impact of the closure, making the ending feel overwritten and less potent than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic but is hampered by scaffolding and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "The task was not merely a technical exercise; it was a labor of love" state what should be inferred. The core idea of preserving memory is restated in similar terms multiple times, slowing momentum rather than deepening meaning, and giving parts of the narrative a slightly padded feel.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from abstraction and a tendency to summarize internal states rather than dramatize them. There are instances of overwriting and conceptual loops, such as "To transcend was not just to overcome but to understand..." The rhythm is deliberate but can feel ponderous due to sentence structures that favor telling over showing. The overall effect is clear, but lacks the concision and propulsion of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant overwriting and repetition. Phrases like "encrypted devotion," "celestial and terrestrial," and "dusky harmony" are used as recurring motifs but become prose loops that dull momentum. The reliance on abstract nouns and stacked modifiers ("soft, ethereal glow," "deep and abiding sense of wonder") often tells rather than shows, and several sentences paraphrase the content of the preceding one, creating redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual nouns over concrete imagery. There are instances of redundancy and near-synonymous phrasing ("bending, warping") that reduce precision and momentum. The sentence structure, while clear, lacks variety, creating a placid rhythm that doesn't modulate with the rising intensity of the magical event.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but is hampered by significant redundancy. There are several paraphrase loops, such as stating the motivation to "capture a runaway dream" and then immediately restating it as needing to "recreate the dream." The recurring phrase "Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" feels more like a heavy-handed repetition than an elegant refrain. These loops and repetitive sentence structures slow the momentum and create a sense of being told the same thing multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the prose is clean, it relies heavily on abstraction and summary, especially in pivotal moments. Actions are often followed by sentences explaining their symbolic meaning ("The act was not just a gesture of hope but a tangible expression of her commitment..."). The final paragraph abandons scene work entirely for an expository wrap-up, and there are instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without advancing the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant structural repetition, particularly the overuse of "The curator..." as a sentence opener, which creates a monotonous, template-like cadence. Several key phrases ("brightened disquiet," "inquire into") are repeated without sufficient variation, and adjacent sentences often paraphrase the same idea, which drags the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is clean but relies heavily on summary and abstraction, particularly during action sequences. There is a persistent pattern of telling over showing ("embarked on a series of rescue missions," "navigating treacherous shelves"). The line-level craft is further weakened by cliché ("thick with the scent of old parchment") and a lack of sentence variety, which dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by several artifacts that dull its impact. There is noticeable repetition in sentence structure ("Lyra felt..."), telling instead of showing ("her trained mind was able to recapture..."), and a near-verbatim paraphrase loop ("recapture the essence of the narrative threads..."). These issues create drag and reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is burdened by significant lexical repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. Key terms ("fables of absence," "diplomat's wax seal impression," "merge the threads") are recycled verbatim, creating a mechanical rhythm and reducing information density. The piece reads as if assembled from a list of required elements, with these keywords serving as structural boilerplate rather than organic language.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant redundancy and paraphrase loops, slowing momentum. For instance, the disruption caused by the energy beings is described in two consecutive sentences that restate the same information. This pattern of repetition pads the narrative and dulls the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is functional but suffers from overwriting and a tendency toward ornate, abstract phrasing ("a sliver of silence that seemed to hold the very essence of the stillness"). There are instances of repetitive sentence structures and near-duplicate statements that slow momentum. Phrases like "thistle-blown optimism" feel forced and self-conscious, contributing to a prose style that strains for poetic effect at the expense of crisp, impactful storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, it suffers from occasional conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops that dull its momentum. For example, the idea of her identity being "sculpted" is stated and then restated in nearly identical terms, and her "method" is described in two consecutive, slightly repetitive sentences. These minor scaffolding artifacts slightly mar an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding ("As she wandered," "As she walked," "With every step"). There is a recurring pattern of stating an abstract concept ("ambient awareness," "creative process") and then describing the action, which dulls momentum. This paraphrase-looping and reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs gives the prose a soft, slightly vague quality that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual redundancy. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea in slightly different terms (e.g., "discover the texture of time, to understand the intricate web of moments"). This looping quality, combined with a tendency to tell rather than show ("she began to sense the underlying rhythms of the universe"), flattens momentum and makes the prose feel sluggish and overly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear but leans on abstractions and slightly overwrought phrases like "intangibly tangible." There is some conceptual redundancy and synonym churn around the core ideas of silence and gildedness. The line "like seeds taking root in fertile soil" is a stock simile that weakens a pivotal moment, and the overall rhythm feels a bit too smooth and declarative, lacking sentence-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is undermined by significant textual artifacts, primarily conceptual loops and synonym churn. The character's mission is restated three times with minor variations, and other key ideas are paraphrased across adjacent sentences. This repetition severely impedes momentum and gives the piece a padded, overwrought quality despite its brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and functional, with moments of strong imagery. However, it relies on several well-worn phrases ("mere shadow of its former self," "coursing through her veins," "weight of her quest"). There are also some repetitive sentence stems ("Aria felt," "she knew that"), which create a slightly mechanical rhythm. The piece avoids major errors but lacks the line-level precision and propulsion of top-tier writing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels generic or stacked ("ashen charcoal sanctuary," "dark tentacles"). There are minor paraphrase loops, such as describing the sanctuary stirring twice in one sentence. The central phrase "teach suffocating to breathe" is a significant line-level artifact that is conceptually muddled and obstructs clarity rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is functional but lacks precision and propulsion. It relies on vague descriptors like "strange occurrences" and "strange energy," and key moments are summarized rather than shown through concrete detail. Some phrasing is overwrought ("manipulated the very fabric of reality"), which clashes with the otherwise simple sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is hampered by significant structural repetition and overwriting. A recurring template cadence ("As the light danced...", "As they turned...", "As the evening deepened...") creates a monotonous rhythm. Sentences are often burdened with abstract nouns and redundant phrasing, which slows momentum and states meaning rather than evoking it through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and scaffold phrases that dull momentum. The recurring sentence stem "As the reality shifted/continued to shift..." creates a mechanical, template cadence. Several key moments are summarized ("the knight's withdrawn nature began to dissipate") rather than shown, and phrases like "a factually mystical atmosphere" are clunky and overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from repetition and overwriting. Core concepts ("forgotten," "unknown," "remembrance") are looped throughout, dulling momentum. Several phrases are clichés of the genre ("trove of forgotten memories," "beacon of a story untold"). There is a notable paraphrase loop: "...these stories, though unknown, were not entirely lost. The dust patterns... told a story of their own," which restates the same idea without advancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from significant redundancy and paraphrase-looping, particularly around the core themes. The same ideas about erasing history and resisting indifference are restated in slightly different terms across adjacent sentences and paragraphs, slowing momentum. This lack of concision and information density makes the writing feel padded and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from significant repetition and paraphrase loops, especially in the final third. Key phrases ("radiant grotto," "prism atrium," "vested hush," "haunting melody") are reused to the point of diminishing returns. The last five paragraphs restate the same outcome repeatedly, creating momentum drag and dulling the closure image. This redundancy is a major flaw preventing the piece from reaching a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is marred by significant structural repetition and looping, which deadens momentum. The story leans heavily on a "As she [verb]..." template cadence, creating a plodding rhythm. Key phrases like "emerges transformed," "mossy delight," and "hush where past meets prophecy" are repeated verbatim, reading as scaffold rather than purposeful motif, and diminishing the power of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by repetitive sentence structures and conceptual loops. The "Elian felt a sense of..." template cadence appears three times, creating a monotonous rhythm. Similarly, the core idea of uncertainty and navigation is rephrased multiple times without adding new information. These artifacts significantly slow momentum and reduce the information density of the lines.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, suffering from overwriting and repetition. Phrases like "factually mystical," "weight of names," and "luminous regret" are used as incantations rather than meaningful descriptors. There are numerous paraphrase loops, such as restating how flaws tell stories, which stall momentum and dilute the impact of key ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and a template-like cadence, particularly with phrases starting "The collector...". There are several instances of telling over showing ("She was modestly fearless"). The late-story insertion of abstract thematic declarations reads like scaffolding left in the text, disrupting momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear but often falls back on telling instead of showing ("she was determined," "the memories were painful, but Elara knew..."). It relies on clichés and scaffolding, particularly in moments of high emotion. The climax is marred by generic, grandiose phrasing ("the underlying code that governed the universe"), which undermines the specificity of the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is grammatically clean, it is severely hampered by conceptual loops and repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "elusively tangible," "unfasten the anchors," and "eternal instant" are each used three times, creating a distinct text artifact. This repetition, combined with multiple paraphrases of the core theme in the final third, causes the narrative to stall and lose momentum precisely when it should be culminating.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, with good momentum in the scene. The primary weakness is a tendency toward conceptual looping in the final section. Phrases and ideas concerning "secrets," "stories," "uncovering," and "cracks" are restated multiple times, creating redundancy that slightly diminishes the impact of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    While individual sentences are often lyrical, the prose is severely hampered by repetition and conceptual looping, particularly in the final third. Key phrases like "rustling awakenings" and "compress eternity into a moment" are reused to the point of becoming scaffolding. The last five paragraphs devolve into a summary that restates what has just been shown, killing momentum and reading as an unnecessary explanation of the story's own effects.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and scaffold-like phrasing that dulls its momentum. Key phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "words flowing like a river" are repeated, and the central thematic statement is stated almost identically twice. These loops feel like authorial insistence rather than purposeful lyric refrains, creating prose artifacts that detract from the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and a density of abstract concepts that can obscure the action. Phrases like "whispers of a thousand midnights" or "fabric of silence" are stacked closely together, reducing their individual impact. There are also several paraphrase loops where Erebus's skill is described in different ways ("coax music from lifeless boxes," "repair the unbroken," "mending what isn't torn"), which slows the momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally lyrical but is weakened by a reliance on abstract labels for emotional states ("palpable sense of expectation," "weight of her quest"). There are also moments of cliché ("the very fabric of reality was bending"). This tendency to summarize feeling and use familiar mystical phrasing dulls the immediacy of the otherwise strong atmospheric writing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from conceptual looping and a reliance on abstract jargon over concrete imagery. Phrases and ideas ("intricate web," "hidden patterns") are restated multiple times without adding new information, slowing momentum. While grammatically sound, the sentences are often overwritten and dense, prioritizing lush description over the propulsion and clarity needed to make the internal journey feel immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely undermined by conspicuous repetition and paraphrase loops, which is especially damaging in a piece this short. Key phrases like "umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush" are recycled verbatim, functioning as labels rather than earned descriptions. Sentences frequently restate the content of the preceding one, creating a sluggish, padded feel that drains momentum and signals a lack of precision at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but lacks momentum due to several craft issues. There is a frequent use of filter verbs ("Naomi felt," "Naomi watched") that dulls immediacy, and key moments of interaction and discovery are summarized rather than shown. Some sentences are redundant, restating ideas without adding new information or pressure, which contributes to a static, descriptive quality that undermines the story's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from a reliance on abstraction and summary, especially in the final third where the entire resolution is told instead of shown. This robs the ending of any momentum or impact. There are also instances of paraphrase loops ("The task was daunting, but the alchemist was undaunted") and conceptual redundancies that slow the pace. The language is clean but lacks the specificity and propulsion required for top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is clean but significantly weakened by repetitive phrasing and paraphrase loops. The phrase "velvet disquiet" is repeated, and the description of the field trip memory and the children's joy is restated almost verbatim, creating a looping effect that stalls momentum. A template cadence ("The scribe's...," "The atmosphere...") further flattens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains moments of lyricism but is hampered by a reliance on abstract nouns ("energy," "purpose," "clarity," "serenity") and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Several sentences restate the previous one's content in slightly different terms, creating a repetitive, declarative cadence. Figurative language is sometimes generic, and the overall texture could be sharpened by replacing high-level descriptors with more concrete, sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear, but it suffers from occasional scaffolding and redundancy. Phrases like "Her motivation was to favor listening over noise, to tune into the subtle rhythms of the sanctuary and understand its hidden patterns" use multiple clauses to state a single idea. The final paragraphs drift into abstraction and summary, which dulls the impact of the otherwise concrete imagery built earlier in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant structural repetition and conceptual loops. Key phrases ("a deep connection to the universe, a sense of primal elegance") are repeated almost verbatim, and adjacent sentences often paraphrase each other, slowing momentum. This pervasive redundancy and overwriting obscure clarity and make the piece feel labored rather than elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is hampered by overwriting and redundancy, which slows momentum. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops ("unspoken words that lingered... words that held the secrets") and synonym churn ("decay and desolate sorrow"). The consistent use of long, complex sentences creates a uniform, sluggish rhythm that doesn't modulate with the story's minor shifts in tension, reading as a stylistic tic rather than a purposeful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and conceptual looping, particularly in the first half. The core ideas (timelessness, searching for patterns, the silo's new purpose) are restated multiple times with slight variations, which slows momentum. Sentences rely on abstract nouns ("stillness," "quality," "significance") rather than concrete, sensory details, and pivotal moments are often told ("Their efforts were rewarded") instead of shown.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is marred by redundancy and paraphrase loops, especially concerning the theme of connection and harmony. Phrases like "a soothing melody that seemed to harmonize" and "a soothing melody that seemed to echo" repeat concepts without adding new information. This, combined with a tendency towards abstract, overwritten sentences, dulls the momentum and impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "gently systematic," "brazen calm," and "botanical diary" are looped excessively, creating a sense of mechanical construction. The piece relies heavily on transitional phrases like "As they worked" and "With each passing day," resulting in a monotonous, list-like rhythm that tells a story rather than immersing the reader in it.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("The skeptic's eyes," "The skeptic's thoughts," "The skeptic's footsteps") and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea using different abstract nouns, such as the descriptions of anticipation and stillness. While evocative, the figurative language is often dense and overwrought, choosing high-level descriptors over concrete, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is lush but suffers from significant redundancy and overwriting. Key phrases are repeated almost verbatim (e.g., "scent of blooming flowers," "sound of bird calls"), and a template cadence ("As he drove...", "As he reached...", "As he worked...") flattens the rhythm. These prose artifacts create momentum drag and dull the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is generally clear but is marred by abstract, clunky phrasing and a tendency to tell rather than show. Lines like "a sudden jolt of tinted revelations, as if the leaf was revealing a hidden truth" are vague and overwrite the moment. There is also a reliance on template sentence stems centered on "feeling" ("Lyra felt," "Kael felt"), which dulls momentum and creates a monotonous rhythm. The craft lacks the precision and information density required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is weakened by repetitive scaffolding, particularly the frequent use of "felt a sense of..." which tells the emotion rather than showing it. Redundancies like "The silence surrounding her was almost palpable, an echoed silence" and the repeated phrase "twinkling like diamonds" slow momentum and reveal a lack of line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it lacks momentum and information density. It suffers from over-telling and cliché, such as "embracing the unknown with open arms" and a sense of accomplishment "wash[ing] over them." Several sentences state abstract conditions ("the air grew thick with an otherworldly energy") instead of grounding the reader in concrete, sensory details that would make the experience immediate and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it leans on abstractions and some clichés ("the air was thick with the weight of unspoken words"). There's a slight overwriting tendency, with ornate phrases doing work that more concrete imagery could accomplish more effectively. The rhythm is steady but lacks the sentence-level propulsion needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, hindering momentum with excessive abstraction and redundant phrasing. A key example of a paraphrase loop occurs with the feather: its power is described, then immediately restated in more abstract terms. This pattern of stating and then restating with synonyms or abstractions ("a heady aroma that seemed to seep") adds lexical density without advancing meaning, ultimately softening the impact of the story's powerful images.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and grammatically sound, but it is marred by a recurring template cadence, particularly the heavy use of "As he..." clauses to begin sentences ("As he fidgeted," "As he worked," "As he walked"). This syntactic repetition creates a monotonous rhythm that dulls momentum. There are also moments of conceptual redundancy, such as "expectant hush... woven hush" and "expectant silence... fierce repose," which feel slightly overwritten rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose in the first half is competent, but the story's conclusion is severely damaged by extensive paraphrase-loops and repetitive phrasing. The final paragraphs churn through the same thematic keywords ("price of forgiveness," "power of art," "refract the truth") to the point of killing momentum and undercutting the climax. These prose artifacts in the crucial final beats are a major structural flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy and looping. Multiple key thematic and descriptive phrases are repeated verbatim three times across the short narrative, which halts momentum and reads like authorial scaffolding. This synonym churn and conceptual repetition ("creaked and groaned") demonstrates a lack of concision and polish at the line level, obscuring the story's more compelling images under a layer of clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.5)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from significant repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. The line "As she worked, the world around her melted away" is used twice verbatim, as is "felt a sense of peace settle over her." The repetition of key phrases like "temporary eternity" and "vivid colors and textures" creates a looping effect that drains momentum and reads like a narrative template rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is undermined by significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum. A repetitive template cadence ("Elian felt...") appears multiple times, creating a monotonous rhythm. Concepts like "vibrations of intent" are recycled without development, and abstract, overwrought phrases like "screaming tenderness" are used as a crutch, dulling the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains striking images, but is weakened by a reliance on abstract conceptual phrases and some redundancy. A paraphrase-loop occurs in the line "to reclaim the past, to rediscover the contours of a world that had been lost." The final paragraph also tends to summarize the navigator's new state ("she was ready to move forward") rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the change, dulling the closure's impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is clean but lacks immediacy and propulsion due to its reliance on summary and abstract language over concrete, sensory detail. There are instances of repetitive sentence structures and phrasing that slow momentum. The piece consistently tells the reader what the forager feels and realizes, rather than showing it through embodied action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from significant redundancy and scaffolding, especially in the second half. Phrases like "witnessed isolation" and "opal dock" are repeated to the point of momentum loss. There are clear paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea ("the lighthouse was a repository... a keeper of memories... absorbing the memories... storing them"), which clutters the narrative and dulls the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally clear but marred by repetition and scaffold-like sentence structures that create a monotonous rhythm. Several key moments are summarized instead of dramatized ("each one testing her resolve"). There are also direct paraphrastic loops, such as describing the "scent of blooming flowers" in the cavern twice in nearly identical terms, which slows momentum and suggests a lack of line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant structural artifacts. There are pervasive paraphrase-loops ("fabric of reality begins to unravel" / "was beginning to fray") and a monotonous template cadence of declarative emotional statements ("she felt a sense of..."). These redundancies and scaffolding constructions severely inhibit momentum and clarity, dulling the impact of the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic but suffers from repetition and abstraction. Key phrases are looped ("revalue its significance"), and the narrative relies on abstract nouns over concrete verbs, which can slow momentum. There are no major grammatical errors, but the sentence-level craft lacks the propulsion and information density of top-tier work, often re-stating concepts instead of advancing them through new images or actions.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is hampered by significant redundancy and looping. Several key phrases and sentences are repeated almost verbatim, such as the description of feral nostalgia's transformation. There are also numerous paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, which dulls momentum and creates a templated feel, particularly in the story's second half, which weakens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstraction. There are several paraphrase loops where the same idea (e.g., her ability to perceive emotions) is re-stated in slightly different terms, which stalls momentum. The reliance on abstract nouns and declarative statements about meaning makes the prose feel static and less propulsive than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it's held back by several prose artifacts. There are instances of overwriting ("etched into the annals of history") and synonym churn ("The tea ceremony platform continued to drift, a tiny, serene world unto itself"). The key phrase "saturated hush" is repeated at the end, feeling more like a forced thematic bookend than a natural recurrence, slightly dulling the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains some elegant, atmospheric descriptions, particularly in the opening. However, it is weakened by moments of conceptual imprecision and overwriting. The jarring insertion of the orchard metaphor feels like a seam, and the phrase "metaphorical tapestry" summarizes an action that should be conveyed through image. These moments of telling rather than showing, combined with the register-clash of "induced currents," create an uneven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is burdened by abstraction, redundancy, and a lack of specific, concrete imagery in key moments. The piece contains numerous paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea using different words (e.g., the paragraph on silence and hush). This tendency to tell and then re-tell conceptually, rather than show through action, significantly drains the story's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant line-level artifacts that disrupt momentum and clarity. A repetitive template cadence ("The shepherd's eyes...", "The shepherd's task...", "The shepherd's hand...") appears throughout, creating a mechanical rhythm. The piece also relies on abstract, "writerly" phrases ("razor edges of time," "fabric of time") that feel more like thematic labels than precise, grounded descriptions, leading to a sense of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a lack of concision and an over-reliance on abstraction. The information density is low, with multiple sentences often restating the same high-level concept in slightly different terms, creating a looping effect. Figurative language, such as "a quiet wildfire that seemed to burn within her very soul," feels like a stock phrase. The sentence structure lacks variety, contributing to a momentum drag that keeps the introspective pace from ever feeling urgent or propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from repetition and scaffolding. Key concepts ("lucid contradictions," "mica pane," "widen perspectives," "clover melancholy") are mentioned so frequently that they lose their impact and feel like checklist items. There are paraphrase loops where the same idea is restated in slightly different terms, which slows momentum and gives the piece a mechanical feel.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, but it is marred by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase-loops. Sentences often restate the same idea in slightly different terms (e.g., "a pattern, a loop of sorts," or describing the music as "haunting, yet beautiful" and then "eerie and captivating"). This slows momentum and creates a feeling of static summary rather than forward propulsion. The piece relies heavily on telling emotional states ("cherished these relationships," "felt a sense of peace") instead of showing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is crippled by severe repetition and template-cadence artifacts. Phrases like "preserve the weight of small moments" and "haunted euphoria" are looped to the point of becoming incantations, losing all meaning. Sentences frequently follow the "The archivist [verb]..." pattern, creating a plodding, mechanical rhythm. This lack of concision and propulsion, combined with overwrought descriptors, makes the reading experience a significant chore.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    While containing some strong imagery, the prose is hampered by occasional paraphrase loops that slow momentum. For example, the shift in atmosphere is described and then immediately restated in different words. The reliance on abstract emotional nouns ("hope," "sadness," "joy") also slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is hampered by several prose artifacts. The triple repetition of the phrase "quiet blaze" becomes a noticeable tic that dulls its impact. There are also moments of paraphrase loops, where an idea is stated and then immediately restated in slightly different terms (e.g., "a moment of reverence, a recognition of the ancient rhythms..."), which slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but lacks momentum due to abstraction and repetition. There are several instances of conceptual redundancy, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms (e.g., the paragraphs on restoring the pen vs. mending reality). This over-explaining dulls the story's propulsion and reduces information density, particularly in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, but it occasionally relies on abstract concepts and telling over showing. Phrases like "mapping silence" and "tuning the atmosphere to a different frequency" are conceptually interesting but are asserted rather than dramatized with concrete detail. There is some minor conceptual repetition, as the advisor's motivation is stated in slightly different ways, which creates small pockets of narrative drag.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns over concrete imagery. Several key phrases ("forgotten promise," "faded tapestry fragment," "lost civilization") are repeated to the point of becoming incantatory loops, dulling their initial impact. Sentences frequently summarize complex events or feelings in a single clause, such as "weaving a narrative that was both personal and archaeological," which flattens momentum by telling what should be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is hampered by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Several sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms, slowing momentum, as when the "bittersweet feeling" is immediately followed by an explanation of what the "sorrow" was a reminder of. This tendency to tell and then re-tell abstracts the emotion and weighs down the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean but exhibits signs of scaffolding and summary. Lines like "It was a challenge she had set for herself, one that required patience..." tell the reader what should be shown through action. The use of diagnostic labels such as "the calculated spontaneity that drove her" externalizes character traits instead of embedding them in behavior, weakening the overall immediacy and momentum of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    While containing moments of evocative phrasing, the prose is critically weakened by pervasive text artifacts. The repeated use of phrases like "stillwater tension" (5 times) and "silent empathy" (3 times) functions as a template cadence or loop, severely reducing information density and momentum. This repetition dulls the impact of the language and reads as a stylistic crutch rather than a sophisticated, evolving motif.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstraction and overwriting, which dulls its impact. Concepts like "cradling the weight of the world in his mind" and "forests of second thoughts" are repeated without being grounded in concrete imagery. This creates a gauzy, dreamlike quality that undermines the story's stakes and momentum, resulting in a low information density per line.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmical, but it's hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and a high density of abstract adjectives ("lithe and agile," "combative tenderness," "fierce and gentle heart"). Some sentences state and then restate the same idea in slightly different terms, creating minor paraphrase loops that soften momentum. The reliance on telling, rather than showing through concrete action, is a recurring issue.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstract summary and conceptual repetition, which drains momentum. The story frequently tells the reader the effect of an action ("wove a hypnotic spell," "wore a spell of remade hush") instead of showing the action and letting the effect land. Scaffolding phrases like "a testament to" and "a reminder of" appear multiple times, creating a sense of conceptual looping rather than forward propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Despite some beautiful phrasing, the prose is critically damaged by severe paraphrase-loops. Core ideas, such as the dissolving of boundaries, are restated multiple times in slightly different terms, stalling momentum and dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but suffers from low information density and a reliance on abstract summary over concrete dramatization. Sentences like "The concept of bartered awakenings had taken root" are scaffolding that state a change instead of showing it. The final third of the story consists of multiple paragraphs that paraphrase the same core idea, creating significant redundancy and dragging the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is undermined by several artifacts, including paraphrase loops that restate the same idea in slightly different words (e.g., the journey's purpose is described twice identically). It relies heavily on abstract nouns and weak modifiers ("soft," "gentle," "deep sense") instead of concrete, specific imagery. This creates a gauzy, overwrought texture that obscures rather than sharpens the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clean but prone to abstraction and overwriting, particularly in moments of emotional reflection ("desolate landscapes of their own soul," "transcended their individual sorrow"). There are instances of near-synonym loops that slow momentum and reduce information density. For example, the rekindling of "subdued ardor" is followed by a description of the curtains "guiding the jewelry maker toward a new understanding," two sentences that cover very similar ground. The reliance on abstract concepts over concrete images dulls the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is crippled by extensive paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing that significantly impede momentum and create an artificial, algorithmic feel. Key terms from the prompt are recycled verbatim multiple times, a critical prose artifact. While some descriptions are initially evocative, the pervasive redundancy and scaffold sentences ("It was a task that...") make for a sluggish and inorganic read, representing a major flaw in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and conceptual looping, particularly with phrases like "atoms of nostalgia" and "anguished joy." Several sentences serve to paraphrase or restate preceding ideas, creating momentum drag, especially in the conclusion. This repetitive scaffolding dulls the impact of the final beats and reads like authorial boilerplate rather than sharp, purposeful prose.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but relies on abstract nouns ("presence," "connection," "disconnection," "sense") and scaffold-like sentence stems ("As she read," "As she watched"). This creates a slightly repetitive, template-like rhythm that distances the reader from the immediacy of the character's experience. Several phrases, such as "not quite there, yet not entirely absent either," feel like redundant paraphrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is undermined by severe textual artifacts, primarily paraphrase loops and repetitive sentence stems. The same concepts (reconstructing, shedding layers) and phrases ("shimmering stillness") are recycled throughout, creating significant drag and a sense of artificiality. This synonym churn and template cadence severely reduces information density and dulls the momentum of what should be a quiet, propulsive reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant line-level issues, most notably repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops. The phrase "The silence of the tower was broken" appears twice in quick succession, and the "whispers" of plants are mentioned multiple times without development. This, combined with a reliance on abstract nouns over concrete imagery, creates a sluggish and cluttered reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is weakened by a reliance on abstraction and conceptual language ("spatially imaginative mind," "manifestation of the unused love"). There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, slowing momentum. While aiming for a lyrical quality, the execution often results in overwritten or vague phrasing that obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a high density of abstract figurative language ("remembered stardust," "shadowed rapture") that blurs meaning. There are clear paraphrase loops, such as the back-to-back sentences explaining the goal of freeing creativity. This redundancy and lack of concision create significant momentum drag and obscure the story's emotional core beneath layers of decorative language.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but relies on abstract labels like "otherworldly energy" and "essence of forgotten knowledge" where concrete sensory details would be stronger. There are minor instances of paraphrase-loops ("captivating and disorienting, making it difficult to discern..."). Phrases like "a testament to" in the final paragraphs feel slightly boilerplate, summarizing the theme rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and conceptual loops, which critically stall momentum. Phrases like "hum of insight," "Mechanical rainforest," and "sound of wind through different trees" are used to the point of becoming incantations rather than descriptions. Multiple paraphrase-loops ("unravel the mysteries... understand the workings," "rediscover the wild frontier... explore the uncharted territories") create significant redundancy and drain the narrative of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    While often evocative, the prose is significantly weakened by line-level artifacts. There are paraphrase loops ("Eira's gentle persistence...") and, more critically, a repetitive template cadence in the narration ("the travelers felt..."). These patterns dull the story's momentum and prevent the otherwise strong writing from achieving its full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is clean, it suffers from redundancy and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Lines like "In this silence, the bellhop felt the weight of their own unpardonable silence, a burden they had carried" use near-synonyms without adding new information. The final paragraphs, in particular, shift from showing to strategic telling and then into overt summary ("Their story was one of..."), which feels like scaffolding that should have been removed.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting, with frequent adjective-noun pairings ("diminutive titan," "glittering stars," "worn leather-bound tome") and abstract declarations that stall momentum. There is a tendency towards telling, exemplified by the line "The tone of the moment was one of graceful collapse," which explains the mood rather than creating it. While grammatically sound, the sentences lack rhythmic variety and propulsion, reading more like a descriptive summary than an immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is marred by several instances of conceptual looping and abstract labeling. Phrases like "periodically eternal" and "drifting moored" are scaffold-like, telling the reader an abstract quality instead of showing it through concrete detail. These moments of overwriting dull the immediacy and create redundancy, particularly when the story's core ideas are repeated across different sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from noticeable text artifacts that dull its impact. There are several instances of synonym stacking ("fervor, its passion and conviction") and repetitive phrasing, particularly the overuse of "reignite" and "rekindle," which creates a template cadence and reduces the elegance of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from a lack of concision and momentum, with several instances of paraphrase loops and redundant phrasing ("The whispers of the flora swirled around her, a gentle susurrus..."). Sentence structures become repetitive, particularly in the final third, creating a monotonous rhythm. Word choice leans on abstraction where concrete detail would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by recurring scaffold language and abstract labels that tell rather than show ("pearl of stillness," "nucleus of calm"). These phrases are repeated, functioning as thematic signposts that flatten the texture of the experience. This reliance on jargon-like concepts in key moments creates conceptual redundancy and dulls the immediacy of the otherwise strong sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and looping, which severely harms momentum. Key phrases ("forgotten library," "luminescent ache," "necessary darkness," "fragmented reality") are reiterated to the point of dilution. This, along with frequent paraphrase-loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, creates a static and overwritten texture that obscures the narrative's progression and feels like authorial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from notable redundancy. The section describing the ink's function contains paraphrase loops that stall momentum ("used these patterns to disappear... Through the use of these patterns, the individual had managed to vanish"). These moments of inefficient prose dilute the narrative drive at a key point of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but is hampered by occasional clichés ("shiver ran down her spine," "indigo eyes") and a tendency towards summary over scene in the final third. Several sentences in the concluding paragraphs are paraphrase-loops, restating what has already been established and thus slowing momentum right at the moment of closure. These artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and often evocative ("tranquil blaze of life"). However, it suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Key ideas, such as the sword being a relic of a past life and the farm being a sanctuary, are restated multiple times in slightly different phrasing, which dulls momentum and weakens the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is clean and often elegant, it is marred by a recurring artifact: conceptual redundancy. Several key actions or ideas are stated and then immediately paraphrased in a subsequent clause or sentence, such as "began to voice silence, letting the stillness around her become a sound." This pattern of statement-plus-explanation slows the momentum and creates slight narrative drag, a noticeable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is significantly weakened by repetition, loops, and template cadence. Numerous phrases are reused to the point of becoming artifacts that stall momentum and feel artificial. Sentences frequently paraphrase preceding ones, adding little new information. This overwriting obscures the story's stronger structural and atmospheric elements under a layer of stylistic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from a lack of concision and occasional overwriting. Figurative language is sometimes stacked without adding clarity, as in "the shadows cast by the flickering candles twisting and writhing like living things." There are also minor paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, slightly slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is severely undermined by significant repetition and text-loop artifacts. Most critically, the sentence "The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world, a world that was slowly coming into focus" appears verbatim twice, which is an immediate disqualifier for publication. Other key phrases are also recycled to the point of becoming boilerplate, draining the narrative of momentum and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and conceptual redundancy. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops, such as explaining what the act of renaming means immediately after it happens, which stalls momentum. The density of abstract figurative language ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "warm coldness") often obscures rather than clarifies, and a template-like cadence in the final paragraphs dulls the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose, while aiming for a lush, evocative quality, is marred by repetitive sentence structures and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. The recurring "Echo felt..." stem creates a monotonous cadence. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea with different words, such as the garden shifting and reality being reshaped. This redundancy, combined with a tendency toward adjective-heavy descriptions, results in overwriting that clutters the narrative rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean but lacks consistent propulsion, with several instances of conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "sea of mental images and emotions" followed by "jumble of colors and textures" restate the same internal state without advancing it. Some word choices, such as "willowglass hope," feel ornate and self-conscious, and the repetition of "fractally precise" dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and conceptual loops, particularly in the final third where feelings and motivations are restated. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea without adding pressure, slowing momentum. For instance, the declaration of being "undaunted" and the description of the cave as a "labyrinth" feel redundant, contributing to a sense that the story is padding its length rather than driving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is burdened by an over-reliance on abstract nouns and stock phrases ("fabric of time," "tangled skein of memories," "unspoken words"). There are multiple instances of paraphrase-loops where the same idea is restated in slightly different terms, which creates a sluggish pace and low information density. This lack of concision and specificity is a primary weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant line-level issues detract from the story's effectiveness, primarily through repetition and paraphrase loops. Phrases like "The mist swirled around her" and "The spy felt a sense of..." are reused, creating a monotonous rhythm. Adjacent sentences frequently restate the same idea in slightly different words, reducing information density and slowing momentum, a critical flaw for publication-level prose.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lyrical but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of similes and abstract figurative language that sometimes performs the opposite of the story's stated goal of simplification. There are several instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing the mist and then immediately re-describing it as a "shroud." The reliance on high-register, conceptual nouns ("palimpsest," "serenity," "essence") dulls the impact of the concrete sensory details, making the line-level execution feel less distilled than the theme it claims to embody.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally graceful and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it's hampered by a reliance on abstract conceptual nouns ("fractured timelines," "temporal dislocation") and some repetitive phrasing. The gentle, pulsing, thrum-like quality is mentioned multiple times in the second half, creating a slight loop that dulls its initial impact. The clarity is good, but the line-level work lacks the consistent concision and propulsion of top-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is marred by distinct text artifacts that dull momentum. There are several paraphrase loops, most notably the near-immediate restatement of the gardener's motivation to "bring light into the darkness." This redundancy, combined with some repetitive sentence structures, weighs down an otherwise clean and atmospheric style.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and paraphrase loops that stall momentum. Key concepts ("brittle awakenings," "forge a new path forward") are reiterated almost verbatim, creating a circular feeling rather than a progression. This textual scaffolding makes the piece feel like a first draft in need of aggressive tightening for clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on telling, particularly when conveying Lena's internal state ("she had always been driven by a desire to understand," "she felt a sense of connection"). This tendency toward abstraction and summary dulls the immediacy of key moments. The final paragraphs, in particular, summarize the emotional and thematic payoff rather than letting it land through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, suffering from frequent paraphrase-loops, scaffold sentences, and an over-reliance on abstract summary over concrete action. Phrases like "the atmosphere electric with the sense of possibility that hung over the divided community like a challenge" are overwrought and tell rather than show. The writing lacks momentum and specificity, feeling more like an outline than finished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is functional but frequently overwrought and reliant on abstract summary over concrete embodiment, especially for emotions ("felt an electric thrill," "filled with a sense of pride"). The final paragraphs are particularly weak, lapsing into scaffold-like thematic statements and repetitive "sense of" constructions. This tendency to tell the reader the significance of events rather than showing them dulls the story's impact at critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from a reliance on abstraction and telling over showing. Pivotal emotional moments are summarized ("she felt herself becoming more attuned") instead of being rendered through concrete detail. There are instances of scaffolding and conceptual paraphrase loops, particularly around the story's core themes. The language, while grammatically clean, lacks the propulsion and information density of high-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and scaffolding that dulls its impact. Phrases like "nervously confident," "experimental weather station," "spongey dread," and "reversible exile" are reused to the point of becoming artifacts. This looping quality, particularly the contradictory re-use of "nervously confident," flattens the narrative progression and suggests a lack of sentence-level variety and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is significantly weakened by overwriting and repetition, especially in the final third, which devolves into summarizing the story's events and themes. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops and identical phrases ("The pixelated amnesty had given them a voice..."). This scaffolding flattens the story's momentum and dulls the impact of the otherwise effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual summary over concrete imagery. There are several instances of paraphrase loops, where an idea is presented and then immediately restated in slightly different terms, which slows momentum. For example, the description of the train as a "testament to forgotten dreams" is followed by reflections on it being a "poignant example" of dead-end paths, covering the same ground.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear, but it suffers from conceptual looping and redundancy. The idea of burdens becoming manageable is stated multiple times using similar phrasing, which slows momentum. For example, "the weight became more manageable" is echoed by "burdens that once seemed insurmountable become manageable." This repetition, combined with abstract emotional labeling, creates a static quality that dulls the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetition and scaffolding. Key concepts like the motivation, the attribute, and the "warlike serenity" are stated and restated in similar terms, creating conceptual loops. There is a frequent use of a "The [noun] [verb]" sentence structure, which results in a monotonous, templated cadence that flattens the narrative rhythm and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is ambitious but overwrought, relying heavily on abstract, high-register nouns ("eclipsed covenant," "intersection of dreams," "fabric of time"). This creates a conceptual density that can feel ungrounded. Several text artifacts dull the momentum, including paraphrase loops in the final third that restate her discovery and motivations. The repetition of key phrases like "anxious elation" and "possibilities were endless" feels more like a scaffold than an organic return.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy, which clogs momentum. Paraphrase loops are common, such as describing the spell's effect multiple ways in one sentence ("destiny shifting," "threads of fate...unravel"). The reliance on lofty, abstract nouns and adjectives ("otherworldly energy," "expectant hush") creates a purple haze that distances the reader from concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is burdened by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops, particularly in the second half where the same idea of a "new beginning" is rephrased multiple times. There is a heavy reliance on abstract nouns ("stillness," "restlessness," "longing," "possibility," "purpose") and cliché formulations ("bitter aftertaste," "spark of determination"). These artifacts dull the momentum and obscure the story's emotional core under layers of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant scaffolding and repetitive phrasing. Entire paragraphs serve to summarize Elara's internal progress ("With each passing moment, Elara felt herself drawing closer to the truth..."). There are numerous paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without advancing the narrative. This tendency to narrate cognitive processes abstractly drains the story of momentum and immediacy, leaving the line-level craft feeling sluggish and overly explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose maintains a clean, deliberate rhythm, but it is burdened by a heavy reliance on abstraction and conceptual nouns ("concept," "existence," "motivation"). There are numerous paraphrase-loops where adjacent clauses or sentences restate the same idea using different words, which slows momentum and reduces information density. The piece suffers from an extreme case of "telling" over "showing," with philosophical labels standing in for dramatized action and feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant line-level issues, including repetitive phrasing ("latent radiance," "resonant hush") and conceptual loops ("The pearl, it seemed..."). The narrative consistently tells instead of showing pivotal moments, summarizing the core conflict rather than rendering it in scene. This, combined with constant filter verbs, results in a lack of momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition and template-cadence issues. The phrase "a testament to..." appears four times, and the central theme is paraphrased multiple times, creating conceptual loops that stall momentum. Sentences like "The world, it seemed, was full of hidden patterns..." are nearly duplicated, which reads as a prose artifact rather than intentional repetition, dulling the story's overall impact and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is often elegant, it suffers from significant overwriting and a reliance on abstract, literary-sounding phrases ("intensity that bordered on reverence," "electric sense of anticipation"). Several paraphrase loops occur, such as when the dreamer being a "conduit" is immediately restated as words being "spoken through them." These artifacts dilute the momentum and clarity of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by telling over showing, with crucial plot points delivered through summary ("The images revealed a complex web of possibilities..."). There are several text artifacts, including a paraphrase loop where the mystery of the violin is stated twice in nearly identical terms. Sentence structures are often repetitive, relying on subordinate clauses that slow momentum rather than build it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but it is marred by minor but persistent artifacts. There are several instances of paraphrase loops ("emanate... illuminating") and synonym churn ("wonder... awe"). The final third also leans heavily on abstract nouns like "cosmos," "infinite," and "divine," which slightly dilutes the story's hard-won specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by significant craft issues. Repetitive sentence stems ("As she worked," "As she climbed") create a mechanical, templated cadence. There are numerous paraphrase loops where the same ideas—the hairpin's significance, the cycle of rebirth—are restated without advancing the narrative. The reliance on abstract emotional labels over concrete, sensory detail dulls the story's immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a lack of momentum due to severe redundancy and abstraction. The story is laden with paraphrase loops ("a complex web... all tangled together") and synonym churn, especially in the final third, which reiterates the same points across multiple paragraphs. This overwriting obscures action and dulls the closure by burying a strong final image under repetitive thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and scaffolding. Phrases like "sycamore hush," "patterns in the pond," and "gentle lapping" are repeated to the point of becoming distracting artifacts. Many sentences fall into a simplistic "The [noun] was [adjective]" template, creating a monotonous cadence that drains the narrative of propulsion and demonstrates a lack of syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant conceptual and syntactic looping. The same ideas (stillness, patterns, vibrations, resolve) are restated in slightly different phrasing throughout, creating redundancy that slows momentum. Several paragraphs could be condensed without loss of information, indicating a lack of sentence-level density and a reliance on paraphrase over progression.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is undermined by several artifacts. The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" feels forced and is repeated, dulling its impact. There are paraphrase loops where concepts are stated and then restated slightly differently (e.g., the nature of the sacred). The frequent repetition of "lingering luminance" functions more as a label than an evolving motif, creating a sluggish, overly-scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear but lacks momentum, particularly in the middle section, which contains conceptual loops ("hiding behind the words... hide behind the truth itself") that stall the narrative. There is an over-reliance on telling pivotal emotional and intellectual moments rather than showing them through concrete action. While grammatically clean, the sentence structure lacks dynamism and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose contains some evocative phrases ("ambered observatory deck," "stellar doubt") but is severely undermined by pervasive prose artifacts. The final third is plagued by paraphrase loops and template cadence ("The decision maker felt a sense of..."), which drains momentum and clarity. This repetition of sentence stems and emotional summaries is a significant flaw that obscures the story's otherwise strong atmospheric potential.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is clean, it is severely hampered by redundancy and abstraction, which drains momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops occur, where adjacent sentences restate the same emotional or thematic concept using different words (e.g., the recurring descriptions of sacrifice and forgotten whispers). This repetition, especially in the final third, reads like scaffolding and dulls the impact of the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.1)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from telling over showing and redundancy. Sentences often state a concept directly ("The mage's thoughts turned to the concept of...") rather than embodying it in action or perception. There are noticeable paraphrase loops where an idea is restated in slightly different terms, slowing momentum and thinning the information density of the lines.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by extensive and conspicuous repetition. Key phrases ("spin stories into shared meaning," "precisely humane touch," "midnight ridgeway") are recycled verbatim multiple times, functioning as textual artifacts that stall momentum. The story is also rife with paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without adding new information, resulting in a static and overwritten piece.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into scaffolding and summary. Sentences like "The touch of wonder was something Elara cherished, a spark that ignited her passion..." explain character motivation rather than dramatizing it. This tendency to state abstract concepts interrupts the otherwise immersive momentum built by the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is significantly hampered by overwriting and redundancy. Numerous sentences contain paraphrase-loops (e.g., "palpable silence, a soundless echo") and synonym churn that add clutter without advancing meaning. The reliance on stock metaphors ("diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse") and a high density of adjectives dulls the narrative momentum, demonstrating a lack of concision and precision at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from repetition and scaffold-like sentence structures (e.g., multiple sentences beginning with "The...seemed to be..."). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, such as describing his determination to overcome numbness, which slows momentum. An over-reliance on abstract nouns ("clarity," "turmoil," "tension") in place of concrete, sensory detail makes the climactic moments feel vague and less immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding, particularly the frequent use of "As she..." clauses to begin paragraphs, which creates a monotonous rhythm. Several passages engage in telling over showing ("The proprietor's mind began to flow with theories..."). There are also instances of paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without advancing the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant overwriting and redundancy. A glaring example of a paraphrase loop is: "The hourglass had long since emptied...after the final grain slips through the hourglass." The piece is dense with elevated but generic descriptors ("otherworldly symphony," "haunting tapestry of sound") and repetitive phrasing, which cumulates to obscure momentum rather than enhance atmosphere, particularly in the padded concluding paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is dense and atmospheric but suffers from overwriting and repetition that slows momentum. Figurative language is occasionally stacked ("shrouded in...mist that clung...like a damp shroud"), and conceptual phrases are looped without significant development. The reliance on abstract nouns and slightly opaque concepts ("interiorize exteriors") obscures clarity rather than sharpening it, creating a sluggish rhythm in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is overwrought and relies heavily on abstract nouns and declarative statements of emotion ("a sense of anticipation began to build"). Several sentences suffer from conceptual redundancy, such as "a dance of creation and destruction that seemed to capture the essence of the ember nexus." The reliance on telling over showing dulls the story's momentum and immediacy, leaving pivotal moments feeling summarized rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from a lack of propulsion and several prose artifacts. The rhythm is hampered by repetitive sentence structures, particularly the frequent use of "As she..." clauses. There are instances of conceptual redundancy and overwriting, where abstract language ("as if the very fabric of reality was responding to her presence") is used in place of concrete, specific detail. While atmospheric, the line-level craft lacks the density and precision required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but frequently overwritten with abstract descriptors and purple phrasing that dulls its impact. A significant flaw is the repetitive loop in the final paragraphs, where the image of the world shifting "like the sands in the hourglass" is stated twice in quick succession. This redundancy undermines the power of what should be a singular, resonant closing image, demonstrating a lack of concision at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is undermined by severe repetition and paraphrase loops, particularly in the final third. Key phrases and entire sentence structures are recycled, which drains momentum and reads like a text artifact. For instance, the line "she would return, drawn by the thread and the patterns it wove, to explore the ever-shifting landscape" appears twice, almost verbatim, creating a powerful sense of redundancy that obscures the story's otherwise vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and conceptual looping. Key phrases ("navigate by starlight," "unfolded horizons," "benthic city, once a place of darkness") are reiterated to the point of nullifying their impact. This, combined with cliché descriptions ("diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse"), creates a sluggish, overwritten piece that lacks momentum and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from overwriting and redundancy. There are several paraphrase loops, where adjacent phrases restate the same idea ("a balm to her sorrow, a reminder that she was not alone"). Several sentences are laden with abstract nouns ("residual energy," "sense of closure") and clichéd descriptors ("tears streaming down her face"). The final lines, in particular, summarize the story's meaning rather than letting an image do the work, which dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clean but relies heavily on summary and abstraction, particularly in the concluding paragraphs which tell the reader how Lyra feels and what she will remember. This replaces the opportunity for a resonant final image with exposition. The repetition of "crashing hush" borders on a textural loop, and some phrasing feels cliché ("a testament to the passage of time"), preventing the line-level craft from achieving real propulsion or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but tends toward abstraction and overwriting, with a high density of adjectives that sometimes dulls the impact of the images. Sentences like "The shard seemed to glow with an otherworldly light, as if it held the essence of the digital ghost" are layered but lack concision. The story avoids major errors, but its rhythm could be sharper and its word choices more specific to propel momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from notable redundancy and overwriting, which bogs down the momentum. There are several paraphrase loops, such as describing the echoes as both "whispers of the ancients" and "a cacophony that had been echoing... for centuries" in the same beat. The story also churns through abstract synonyms for its core concepts ("patterns," "rhythms," "harmonies," "texture"), creating density without necessarily adding new meaning. These prose artifacts obscure the story's otherwise elegant structure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is critically hampered by repetitive sentence structures and conceptual loops. The story is saturated with the "Lena felt a sense of..." template, a prose artifact that severely drains momentum and immediacy. This, combined with a reliance on abstract jargon ("gravitationally playful nature," "cosmic joke") over concrete imagery, creates a sluggish and overwritten texture that obscures the story's interesting core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy and abstraction. The core concept of "mechanical world" vs. "beauty" is restated in nearly identical terms throughout the story, creating paraphrase loops that stall momentum. Word choices favor abstract nouns ("vibrancy," "vitality," "wonder") over concrete, sensory images, weakening the narrative's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but leans on generic phrasing ("otherworldly energy," "renewed sense of purpose," "beacon of hope") that dulls the otherwise strong central concept. The final two paragraphs function as a summary loop, restating the thematic implications of the delivery in abstract terms rather than letting the final image resonate. This scaffolding significantly reduces the momentum and power of the ending, reading more like an explanation than a conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose is generally clean but weakened by noticeable text artifacts. There are several paraphrase-loops early on ("seek meaning in the stillness," "interpret silence as possibility," "quest to hear the unheard") that stall momentum. The final third of the story falls into a repetitive template cadence of declarative summary sentences, which flattens the rhythm and explains the emotional impact rather than letting the final images resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is significantly weakened by prominent repetition and paraphrase loops, especially in the second half. Phrases like "The librarian remained, steadfast and alone" and "In this world of observed solitude" are repeated almost verbatim, dulling momentum. This structural redundancy reads like scaffolding rather than intentional, rhythmic prose, detracting from the story's overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetition and overwriting. Key abstract phrases ("cipher of longing," "runaway dream," "luminous absence") are looped multiple times, dulling their impact. This conceptual redundancy, combined with a consistently elevated register, creates a dense but static texture that prioritizes mood over momentum and clarity, reading like a collection of evocative but unanchored statements.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose successfully establishes a lyrical, otherworldly mood, but it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and abstraction. Sentences are often laden with descriptive clauses that slow momentum, and key actions are described with vague, conceptual language ("a delicate, almost ethereal understanding") rather than sharp, concrete detail. Several sentences rely on a repetitive "A and B" construction, creating a predictable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.8)
    Despite some evocative descriptions, the prose is burdened by significant and recurring artifacts. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops ("The uncertainty was almost palpable, a physical presence...") and synonym churn ("determined to recover... fierce determination to uncover"). The heavy reliance on "Emilia felt..." and similar sentence stems creates a monotonous, template-like cadence that dulls momentum and immediacy, significantly weakening the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but it is hampered by several repetitive sentence structures and prose artifacts. There are multiple instances of "The archivist's..." sentence stems and the qualifier "it seemed," which creates a slight template cadence. A few phrases also exhibit minor paraphrase-looping (e.g., "mentor resilience quietly, to guide the exiled soul back..."). These issues, while not crippling, slightly dull the momentum of an otherwise beautifully written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy. There are numerous paraphrase loops and synonym cycles ("serene atmosphere, a radiant hush"; "vibrancy of life... color of wonder"). This dilutes the impact of the imagery and slows momentum. The reliance on abstract nouns and a consistently elevated register creates a lyrical but ultimately vague and imprecise texture.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition and paraphrase loops, which constitute a significant prose artifact. Phrases like "interlaced hush" and "accumulates silence" are recycled multiple times in a very short text, creating momentum drag and a sense of padding. This redundancy critically undermines the story's potential for elegance and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a lack of density and momentum due to scaffolding and paraphrase loops (e.g., “reopen the henge's secrets, to uncover the mysteries”). The crucial discovery beat is conveyed with vague abstractions like “subtle patterns” and a “deeper narrative,” failing to provide the concrete, line-level details needed to make the climax feel specific and real. The story consistently tells what happened instead of showing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, with good rhythm. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and abstract summary that slightly reduce momentum. Phrases like "my mind whirling with the implications" and "a sophisticated sorrow that came from acknowledging the impermanence of all things" tell rather than show, creating small patches of narrative drag.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is atmospheric but marred by significant repetition and text artifacts. Key phrases ("tinkersong wonder," "ghost in code," "articulate the unspoken") are reused to the point of becoming boilerplate, dulling their impact. Sentences like "to articulate unspoken needs, to give voice to the whispers..." present the same idea in a paraphrase loop, which slows momentum and over-explains the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is clean but weakened by repetition and abstract language. The story repeatedly paraphrases its own ideas, such as the spire being a "prison" turned "sanctuary." It relies on telling emotion through labels ("joy," "anguish," "peace") instead of showing it through concrete, embodied detail. This results in a lack of momentum and information density at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from a lack of clarity and concision due to persistent overwriting. Sentences are laden with abstract nouns and vague figurative language ("its quietly explosive power still resonating") that tell rather than show. This creates a sluggish momentum and obscures concrete imagery, with several moments feeling like paraphrased summaries of emotion instead of direct, embodied experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative and atmospheric, but it occasionally slips into overwriting with stacked adjectives ("fractally precise renderings," "deliberate slowness," "quiet reverence"). Several sentences toward the end summarize the emotional and thematic takeaway rather than dramatizing it, such as, "The stillness lingered, a poignant reminder of what had been lost, and what had been gained..." This dilutes the immediacy of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and clear but is hampered by a reliance on adjective-noun pairings and some formulaic constructions ("the scratch of their pen on the paper the only sound"). While effective, the sentence structures lack variety, creating a slightly mechanical rhythm. The piece avoids major errors, but its texture is not as sharp or propulsive as it could be, showing signs of scaffolding that could be removed for greater immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is descriptive but prone to overwriting and conceptual looping. The final paragraphs, for instance, restate the "rhythm of repair" and "secrets of the universe" multiple times with only slight variations. This redundancy pads the conclusion rather than sharpens it. While grammatically clean, the sentences often have a similar, gentle cadence that lacks rhythmic variety and propulsion, particularly for a story about cosmic clockwork.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is clean but relies heavily on clichés ("breathtaking beauty," "stark contrast," "shared sense of purpose") and telling over showing. Sentences often state emotional or thematic conclusions directly, reducing information density and momentum. Figurative language like "brambled hope" is introduced but not supported by the story's smooth, conflict-free texture, creating a tonal mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition that undermines its otherwise poetic quality. Key terms—"hush" (9 times), "adjuster" (14 times), "puppet head" (5 times)—are overused in a very short text, creating a looping effect. Several adjacent sentences effectively paraphrase each other, particularly regarding "the hush," which stalls momentum and reads as a prominent text artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is functional but marred by several artifacts. The heavy repetition of filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "knew") constitutes a template cadence that flattens the prose. The phrase "She was offhandedly exact in her interpretation" is an awkward, abstract assertion that disrupts momentum. While clear, the sentences lack density and propulsion, often summarizing actions rather than rendering them with specific, evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear but is weakened by clichés and scaffolding phrases ("sparked a new idea," "pieces began to fall into place"). The repeated "As she..." sentence openings create a monotonous template cadence. Furthermore, the description of the scientific insight remains abstract ("intricate networks," "complex structures"), missing an opportunity for specific, concrete language that would ground her profession and make the epiphany more vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose begins with elegant, clear descriptions but loses momentum in the final paragraphs. The ending relies heavily on summary and filter verbs ("Ember felt," "she knew," "knowing that she had found"), telling the reader about her new state of being instead of showing it through a final, sharp image. This repetition and scaffolding in the concluding beats dull the impact of an otherwise strong build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from minor artifacts that dull its impact. There is a tendency toward telling over showing ("The sorrow and the regret...all of it was transmitted") and some paraphrase loops that restate concepts. The language is functional but rarely achieves the high information density or sentence-level propulsion needed for top-tier craft, occasionally feeling more like a summary of events than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clean but is marred by a recurring artifact of using abstract, declarative labels in place of concrete, sensory detail (e.g., "empathetically decisive nature," "calm and compassionate demeanor," "vigorous tender hope"). This habit of summarizing qualities dulls the immediacy of the narrative and creates a stylistic flatness. Some sentence structures are also repetitive, hindering momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by persistent scaffolding, paraphrase loops, and synonym churn that severely impede momentum. Sentences frequently restate the content of the previous one ("...a testament to the passage of time and the abandonment that had befallen it."). This narrative throat-clearing and repetition of concepts undercuts tension and makes the story feel significantly padded for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clear but suffers from overwriting and cliché, using phrases like "crackled with age" and "clandestinely luminous glow." There are several instances of telling over showing ("With newfound purpose," "felt a sense of purpose") and conceptual redundancy that slow the momentum. The sentence structure lacks variety, and the reliance on abstract nouns dulls the immediacy of the archivist's experience, particularly during the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and contributes effectively to the quiet, intense tone. However, there are minor instances of conceptual looping, where core ideas like "music that could be felt" are rephrased across several sentences without adding significant new information. This creates a slight drag on momentum in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely hampered by redundancy and looping. Core ideas are stated and then paraphrased multiple times, such as the goal to "uncover" mysteries or the deadline of the "next phase of the moon." This lack of concision and information density pads the narrative and creates significant drag, suggesting the story is stretching a single moment to meet a word count.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean grammatically but is hampered by overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns and telling. There are several paraphrase loops where an idea is stated and then immediately restated in slightly different terms, slowing momentum (e.g., the description of growing quiet and palpable stillness). The density of lofty, figurative language often obscures rather than clarifies, giving the piece a decorative quality at the expense of propulsion and concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has a gentle rhythm but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding, particularly the "As she..., she felt/found..." template cadence. Key thematic phrases are overused, dulling their impact. Pivotal moments rely on assertion ("The scent was like nothing she had ever experienced before") rather than sharp, concrete imagery. While generally clear, the line-level craft lacks the concision and propulsion needed for top-tier publication, with several sentences restating ideas without adding new information or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it suffers from a lack of information density and a tendency toward repetition. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea, particularly in the climax ("The echoes were... the gathering of echoes itself. The echoes were..."). The story relies heavily on telling over showing ("The acceleration was crucial," "The water flow method was reliable"), which flattens momentum and prevents the reader from fully experiencing the world through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops, especially in the second half. Core ideas—the patch as a connection, the complexity of the crash, the investigator's mission—are restated across adjacent sentences and paragraphs, which dulls momentum. Phrases like "The patch, it seemed..." and "The silence of the port city seemed to..." create a repetitive sentence structure, a template cadence that makes the prose feel mechanical and less propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant redundancy and abstraction. The story frequently engages in paraphrase-loops, where a concept is introduced and then immediately restated in slightly different terms, slowing momentum. An overreliance on abstract nouns ("essence," "concept," "existence") and telling ("Elian's motivation was rooted in her belief...") creates a feeling of summary rather than scene, particularly in passages meant to convey character depth or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy and paraphrase loops, which dull its momentum. The idea of silence is stated in at least four different ways ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "stillness," "shroud") without adding new information or pressure. This repetition, along with some clichéd phrasing ("fabric of reality," "ancient and ageless"), creates a padded feel and obscures the stronger descriptive moments.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is clean, it suffers from a noticeable template cadence, with multiple paragraphs beginning "As..." This creates a rhythmic monotony that feels slightly artificial. The piece also relies on abstract intensifiers ("otherworldly energy," "palpable sense of anticipation") and conceptual labels ("lucid turbulence") where more concrete imagery would have been stronger, slightly dulling the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is weakened by several paraphrase loops and redundancies. The near-verbatim repetition of Eira's "task" across two separate paragraphs is a notable prose artifact that dulls momentum and feels unedited.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clean but hampered by conceptual looping and abstraction, particularly in the final third. Sentences repeatedly paraphrase the same idea of revelation and unity ("commune with the world... tap into the collective unconscious... becoming one with the world... uncovered a profound truth"). This redundancy flattens the momentum leading into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, suffering from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. The phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears three times, functioning as a repetitive scaffold rather than an evolving motif. This and other loops ("raveling silence") create a sluggish rhythm and reduce information density, ultimately obscuring the emotional core beneath a layer of decorative language.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and carries a consistent rhythm, but it suffers from moments of overwriting and reliance on cliché ("phoenix from the ashes," "sweet scent of success"). There are several instances of summary and telling where showing would be more powerful, such as "knew that I'd succeeded in creating something truly remarkable." These moments of scaffolding reduce information density and blunt the impact of the more evocative passages.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant scaffolding and repetition. Multiple paraphrase-loops occur, such as describing the world "blurring and shifting" in two separate, similar sentences. The overuse of a single sentence template ("The map maker's...") creates a sluggish, predictable cadence. The language consistently favors abstraction and summary ("sought to understand the hidden patterns") over concrete, sensory detail, particularly during the crucial journey through the multiverse, which dulls momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. The phrase "luminescent ache" is used four times, and variations of "glow" appear repeatedly, creating a conceptual loop rather than an escalating feeling. This reliance on a single, heavily freighted phrase prevents the story from achieving the clean, resonant power it aims for, reading as a prose artifact that obscures the emotion it seeks to convey.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant, recurring artifacts. A pervasive template cadence ("As she worked...", "As the sun rose...", "As she walked...") drains sentences of rhythmic variety. Furthermore, paraphrase loops ("slicing through the darkness" / "piercing the darkness") and conceptual redundancies make the writing feel sluggish and padded.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it tends toward summary and abstraction over concrete action, especially during moments of insight ("he felt his understanding of the world expanding"). The repetition of key thematic phrases like "iridescent caution" and "valley-mist wonder" feels slightly mechanical, like scaffold rather than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is clean but marred by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops, particularly in the second half. The motivation is restated with slight variations, and the storm's passing is mentioned in two consecutive paragraphs with nearly identical phrasing. This repetition stalls momentum and dilutes the narrative's density, reading like scaffolding that should have been removed.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from conceptual redundancy and repetitive phrasing that dulls its momentum. Key phrases like "woven dawns" and "knitting communities" are overused, becoming thematic labels rather than resonant images. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea ("rekindle the dying realm, to revive the spark"), creating loop artifacts that reduce information density and slow the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from conceptual repetition and some stock phrasing. The central idea of paradoxes and the method of "staying while leaving" are restated, bordering on scaffolding. The emotional peak relies on a cliché ("wash over them"), and the overall rhythm lacks syntactic variety, resulting in prose that is functional but lacks propulsion or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and summary, particularly in pivotal emotional moments. Sentences that state feelings ("she felt a sense of tenuous absolution wash over her") outnumber those that embody them. The phrase "heuristically gentle" is a jarring register drift. The final paragraphs are particularly weak, lapsing into telling that dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., "edge of oblivion" followed by "shadows of forgetfulness"). Phrases like "woven into the fabric of" and "illusions of the past faded to memory" are repeated, dulling the momentum and giving the piece a sense of being padded rather than concise.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from several issues that drag momentum. The core motivation, "to capture the sound of trust breaking," is an abstract phrase that is never clarified through concrete action, reading as purple prose. The ending relies on summary ("Lena had gained something valuable," "She had navigated...") instead of dramatization. There are also several stock phrases ("knowing glint," "palpable tension") that dull the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose aims for a lush, evocative style but is weakened by several artifacts. There are paraphrase loops that slow momentum ("She was no longer just a luminous skeptic; she was a seeker of truth, driven by a deep desire..."). Some phrasing verges on cliché ("ethereal glow," "shiver run down her spine"). These repetitions and familiar constructions dilute the power of the otherwise strong imagery, preventing the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and a reliance on abstract concepts over concrete imagery. Phrases like "otherworldly energy" and "inescapable callings" are vague, and the simile "like the slow uncorking of a bottle that had been sealed for too long" is a well-worn cliché. Several sentences state what is already implied, reducing information density and slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is burdened by scaffolding and summary language that flattens momentum (e.g., "The process was painstaking, but Aria was driven by..."). Several sentences paraphrase the content of a prior sentence, leading to low information density and a plodding rhythm. The piece would be significantly stronger if pivotal moments were rendered in scene with concrete sensory detail instead of being recounted from a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and paraphrase loops, with entire sentences restating previous ideas using slightly different wording. This creates a sluggish momentum and gives the piece a padded feel. Word choice leans heavily on abstract nouns ("essence," "beauty," "truth"), resulting in prose that asserts meaning rather than rendering it through concrete, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is hampered by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Several sentences in the first half restate the nature of Aria's internal conflict using different abstract terms. For instance, the description of the box flows into a description of "inner static" which flows into "fragmented wholeness," all circling the same idea. This overwriting dulls momentum and clarity, relying on a cascade of labels instead of sharp, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is clean but lacks density and momentum, relying heavily on summary and abstract language ("The locket's history was palpable," "a narrative began to emerge"). There are instances of scaffold-like phrasing and conceptual redundancy that slow the pace. The lack of concrete, sensory detail in pivotal moments of discovery makes the narrative feel distant and less impactful than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacting, including conspicuous loops of key phrases ("hangman's dice," "calm defiance," "mysterious familiarity") that feel like forced refrains. There are also several paraphrase loops where the same idea is restated in adjacent sentences, slowing momentum. This repetition, combined with abstract and sometimes overwritten descriptions, obscures clarity and gives the piece a mechanical, template-driven feel.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from occasional template cadences and a tendency to state information that could be shown through character perception (e.g., "The dock-side lantern lighter was one such individual"). The final paragraphs become overly expository, summarizing the story's meaning and emotional takeaway instead of letting the final images resonate on their own, which dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition and looping of key phrases ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic"). This template-like cadence creates a synthetic feel and dulls momentum. The phrase "tranquility of the night deepened into a tranquil blaze" is a mixed metaphor that confuses rather than clarifies. These prose artifacts obscure the otherwise strong atmosphere and are pervasive enough to warrant a substantial deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is generally clear but is marred by a significant "template-cadence" artifact, with numerous sentences beginning with "As..." ("As they sat," "As the weeks went by," "As the meteor shower..."). This repetitive structure dulls momentum and creates a mechanical rhythm. Furthermore, there is some reliance on summary and cliché phrasing ("eyes sparkled with curiosity," "shiver run down their spine," "satisfaction washing over him") where more specific embodiment would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose suffers from significant redundancy and paraphrase loops, particularly in the concluding paragraphs, which restate the same concepts of transformation and memory multiple times. This narrative scaffolding dulls the impact of the ending. Phrases like "tragically radiant beauty" and "ethereal ballerinas" lean towards ornate but generic description, reducing line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean but is significantly hampered by conceptual looping and repetitive phrasing. Key ideas—such as the text being "faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct"—are stated almost identically in multiple places, creating redundancy that slows momentum. This pattern of restating the premise acts as a significant prose artifact, dulling the impact of otherwise elegant descriptions and preventing the story from achieving a higher level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy, which drags momentum. Paraphrase loops are common (e.g., describing her voice's sound and then immediately re-describing it). The reliance on abstract nouns ("webs of intrigue," "hum of the universe," "canyons of the soul") and generic descriptors ("haunting and beautiful") in place of concrete, specific imagery dulls the story's impact and makes the prose feel imprecise.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is clean but significantly weakened by repetition and paraphrase loops. Key phrases like "salvage something pure from the wreckage" and descriptions of "cameo appearances" are repeated almost verbatim, stalling momentum. This redundancy suggests a lack of trust in the initial phrasing and pads the word count without adding new information or pressure, a critical flaw for a piece aiming for the highest echelon of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains moments of descriptive beauty, but it is hampered by conceptual looping and overwriting. The phrase "hidden patterns" is repeated to the point of becoming a mantra rather than a developing idea. Adjectival phrases like "scintillatingly somber" feel ornate rather than precise, and some adjacent sentences paraphrase each other, slowing momentum and reducing information density.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is marred by clichés ("as far as the eye could see," "heart pounding," "shiver run down her spine") and scaffold phrases that slow momentum. There are several instances of paraphrase loops, such as the multiple sentences restating Aria's motivation to find the truth. While grammatically clean, the line-level craft lacks the precision and information density required for top-tier publication, relying on telling over showing at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a lack of concreteness, relying heavily on abstraction and summary. There is significant scaffolding ("She knew that," "She realized that," "She saw how") and repetitive phrasing, particularly the reuse of "unfold the narrative." The sentences advance the summary but lack the information density and propulsion of scene-based writing, resulting in a piece that reads more like a detailed outline than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mostly clear but is hampered by overwriting and several text artifacts. Figurative language often defaults to cliché ("creeping... like a hesitant lover," "flowing from him like a river"). There are also paraphrase loops, such as the two adjacent paragraphs explaining his method of capturing sounds, which restate the same idea and slow momentum. The reliance on abstract nouns over concrete, sensory details dulls the immediacy of key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is undermined by significant repetition and overwriting. The awkward phrase "fleshly ethereal" is used twice, and "ethereal" appears three times, dulling its impact. There are multiple paraphrase loops and scaffolded sentences that tell the reader what the character feels (e.g., "Azure Coat felt..."), creating momentum drag and reducing the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clean but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding. Many sentences begin with "The mapper felt/knew/believed," creating a monotonous rhythm and distancing the reader from the action. There are also paraphrase loops, such as the repeated use of "purposeful" to describe her movements, which slows momentum and reduces information density. These artifacts prevent the prose from achieving a truly propulsive or immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clear but hampered by repetition and scaffold phrasing that dulls momentum. The phrase "The sound of the dripping water... reverberate" is used three times, and the idea of "entangled memories" being "untangled" is stated in nearly identical sentences. This paraphrase-looping makes the prose feel mechanical and less impactful, particularly as these repetitions do not accumulate new meaning upon their return.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but lacks propulsion due to repetitive phrasing and abstract language. The phrase "vibrant hush" is used three times, becoming a distracting textual artifact rather than a resonant motif. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea, such as the multiple explanations for why the chaplain came to the shop, which slows momentum and indicates a need for more concise, impactful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is critically hampered by extensive repetition and synonym loops, with phrases like "yearning algorithm," "irreverent awe," and "acid sea" used so frequently they lose impact and read like keyword stuffing. This creates significant momentum drag and undermines the story's atmosphere. Multiple adjacent sentences often paraphrase the same idea, demonstrating a lack of concision and information density that makes the piece feel padded and overwrought at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally clean, but the story suffers from significant structural issues at the line level, particularly in the final act. There are paraphrase loops that state the same idea in consecutive sentences ("obsession grew... driven by a need" followed by "She became convinced..."). Most critically, the climax is summarized in abstract terms rather than shown, which halts momentum and breaks reader immersion at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language ("shadow-laced," "weighted breath," "map of the soul") that feels more ornamental than functional. Several phrases, such as "weighted breath before reply," are repeated in a way that feels heavy-handed rather than resonant. This stylistic excess, combined with abstract jargon, often slows momentum and obscures the story's concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    Significant prose artifacts dull the story's impact. The piece suffers from a severe template-cadence issue with the repeated "I felt a sense of..." stem, creating mechanical rhythm. Furthermore, the final paragraphs contain paraphrase loops, restating the central theme of peace, endings, and beauty multiple times without adding new pressure or insight, which significantly bogs down the momentum at the crucial closure point.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is often graceful, it is marred by significant conceptual looping and repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "destined mismatches," "secrets and stories," and "passionate subtlety" are recycled multiple times, creating redundancy rather than rhythmic reinforcement. This pattern of restatement dulls momentum and gives the piece a slightly mechanical, scaffolded feel, particularly in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by text artifacts, including frequent paraphrase loops and repetitive sentence structures. Phrases like "The prophet's presence was..." and "The line walker felt..." are used as boilerplate, and the constant cycling through synonyms for "calm" and "wisdom" drains momentum. These loops and the overall static cadence obscure the story's emotional core beneath a layer of overwritten, inert language.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clear but suffers from conspicuous repetition and scaffolding. Phrases like "dove gray map case" and "rusted factory ruins" are repeated to the point of becoming formulaic. Multiple paraphrase loops occur, particularly regarding the climbing vines and Luna's feeling of peace, which dulls momentum and reads as a text-artifact rather than purposeful incantation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often elegant, the prose falters by repeatedly resorting to abstract labels for key moments, particularly near the end. Phrases like the crystal "amplifying the scholar's determination" and the scholar feeling "a sense of possibility" tell the reader the emotional effect rather than showing it through concrete perception. This tendency to summarize the story's core feelings in its closing moments dulls the impact of an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is generally clear and evocative, it suffers from several distinct artifacts that a top-tier publication would flag. Noticeable paraphrase loops exist where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without adding pressure or detail. This repetition, combined with a template cadence in several paragraphs, dulls momentum and slightly softens the impact of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant structural repetition and template cadence. Numerous sentences follow a "The [noun] was a [symbol/reminder/testament] of [concept]" pattern, creating a monotonous rhythm. There are also paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, such as the two consecutive sentences describing the clock hand as a reminder of continuity. This scaffolding dulls momentum and makes the prose feel mechanical and overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and redundancy. Abstract concepts like "pulsing stillness" and "scent of hope" are repeated to the point of losing impact. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing the scent of hope as both a "tangible presence" and a "fragrance that wafted" in the same sentence. This lack of concision and reliance on telling over showing dulls the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and scaffolding. Multiple sentences restate Lyra's purpose, the key's significance, and her methodical nature, creating paraphrase loops that stall momentum (e.g., "the clockwork automaton key... a constant reminder" appears twice). The information density is low, with many sentences summarizing what could be shown, resulting in a piece that reads more like a detailed outline than a finished story.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by abstract jargon ("cleft in certainty," "dynamic balance") and significant repetition of key phrases ("changeling's baby tooth," "turn mistakes into constellations"), which stalls momentum. There are several paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without advancing it. While grammatically clean, the sentence structure is often monotonous, and the overwriting of concepts drains the lines of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and conceptual looping. Key phrases like "pearl of stillness" are overused, and adjacent sentences often paraphrase each other, slowing momentum. The language is overwrought with abstractions ("reflectively vibrant presence," "soft, vibrant energy") that obscure rather than clarify, and figurative language like "zephyr bloom" is introduced late and feels tacked on. This results in low information density and a lack of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, especially in its descriptions of the setting ("honeyed hush"). However, the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy, repeatedly stating the nature of Aria's healing and newfound strength. The piece tells the reader what has just been shown, dulling the momentum and impact of the climactic moment with unnecessary scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a reliance on abstract, often clichéd, descriptors ("swirling hush," "turmoil that had been brewing inside her"). There are numerous paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea without advancing the narrative, which slows momentum. The high density of figurative language often feels decorative rather than clarifying, muddying the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from abstraction and redundancy. The piece relies heavily on abstract nouns like "essence," "longing," and "connection" instead of grounding emotion in concrete images. Several paraphrase-loops occur, such as the repeated phrasing around restoring "sacred practices," which slows momentum and dulls the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and overwriting that dulls its momentum. Key phrases are looped—the world "holding its breath" appears twice in almost identical phrasing. The language is dense with abstract concepts ("essence of safekept starlight," "rhythm of existence") that feel more asserted than earned. Several sentences follow a similar template cadence, creating a prose rhythm that feels mechanical rather than organic, obscuring the story's stronger elements beneath a layer of stylistic artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. Momentum is intentionally slow, fitting the story's accumulative nature. The piece is held back from a higher tier by minor but noticeable scaffolding, particularly the repetition of "he felt" in the final third, which slightly flattens the emotional climax by labeling feelings rather than fully embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, but it is marred by a significant text artifact. The line "a testament to the power of her craft and the depth of her insight" is repeated almost verbatim as "a testament to the power of her craft and the depth of her understanding" near the end. This verbatim repetition is a notable flaw that disrupts the otherwise carefully crafted rhythm and feels like an oversight.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but is weakened by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. The idea of "containing" pain is stated multiple times in slightly different ways, and adjacent sentences often restate the same information, slowing momentum. This repetition ("she sought to contain... to channel," then later, "the pain... begin to contain, to become something manageable") reads like scaffolding and dulls the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but burdened by significant artifacts that harm momentum. There is a critical prose loop where a key motivational sentence ("negotiating with their own ghost, reconciling the eroded ambitions") is repeated almost verbatim in the climax, flattening the moment. The reliance on abstract nouns and conceptually dense but vague phrases ("fractured stillness," "eroded ambitions") creates a sense of overwriting that clouds concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by abstraction ("maze of intentions," "equations for hope") and a tendency to summarize internal states rather than dramatize them. There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea, particularly concerning the "deeper truth" revealed by the maze. This robs the narrative of momentum and feels like scaffolding left in the final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops that dull momentum. Key phrases—"soundless sanctuary," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush," "abandoned dream"—are recycled multiple times, reading as textual artifacts rather than purposeful motifs. This synonym churn and template-like repetition, especially of unusual word combinations, creates a monotonous rhythm and suggests a lack of precision at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is severely hampered by repetition and overwriting, which stalls momentum. Key abstract phrases—"thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity"—are looped multiple times, creating a text-artifact pattern that dulls the impact of the final beats. Sentences are often burdened with abstract concepts rather than grounded in concrete sensory detail, resulting in low information density and a sluggish rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and evocative, but it is hampered by several instances of paraphrase loops and redundancy that slow the momentum. For example, the description of the fog "shrouding the harbor in its damp, gray mist" is repeated almost verbatim at the beginning and end. Similarly, statements about her patient nature or her feeling "at home" are restated, which feels like scaffolding rather than purposeful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    While often evocative, the prose is marred by significant issues. There are multiple instances of paraphrase-loops ("understanding... comprehension") and conceptual redundancy ("stillness... silence"). Most critically, the line-level contradiction of the thread snapping and then remaining in the narrator's hand is a severe craft failure that derails the ending. This error, combined with repetitive phrasing, suggests a need for a rigorous editorial pass.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    While containing some lovely imagery, the prose is burdened by significant text artifacts. There is a pervasive repetition of filter verbs, most notably "felt," which appears seven times to label emotions. Several sentences are structured with a template cadence ("As he worked...," "As he turned..."), and there are instances of abstract, overwritten emotional language ("bitterly sweet nostalgia," "quaking reverie," "expectant hush") that inflate texture without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains some strong imagery but is hampered by clichés ("heart sink," "sprang into action") and conceptual redundancy. The final paragraphs, in particular, engage in looping, restating Aria's newfound purpose in slightly different ways ("found her true calling," "continue to tend to the scars," "continue to stand watch"). This repetition dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise quiet and effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, particularly a high density of adjective-noun pairings ("luminous skeptic," "desolate landscape," "sidereal patience") that feel more like prompt-filling than organic description. This creates a monotonous rhythm and slows momentum. There are also instances of paraphrase loops, such as in the second sentence, where two clauses state the same idea in slightly different words. While clear, the line-level craft lacks the concision and propulsion expected of top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of key words and concepts ("nebula garden," "intricate patterns," "transit," "troubling serenity"). This conceptual looping creates significant drag, making the story feel static rather than propulsive. While individual sentences are clear, the constant recycling of the same phrases and ideas reads like a prose artifact and dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative but is marred by occasional overwriting and cliché. Phrases like "turmoil within" and "stir her soul" are generic. The oxymoronic "thundering calm" feels strained, and "its presence as calm as a summer storm" is a confusing simile that disrupts clarity. The final paragraphs contain platitudes ("The world, in all its beauty and sorrow, was a complex and wondrous thing") that dilute the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from significant conceptual looping, with key ideas like "balance," "emerge," and "pendulum" being restated to the point of redundancy, which flattens momentum. While atmospheric, the language is often overwritten with dense adjectives and grand metaphors ("searing reverie that burned away her doubts"). This combination of repetition and overwriting makes the prose feel sluggish and didactic, particularly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is atmospheric but suffers from overwriting and redundancy. Several sentences are burdened with adjectives, and there are instances of paraphrase loops ("unravel the secrets hidden within the tapestry's weave, secrets that might lead them..."). The rhythm can feel overly stately and declarative, slowing momentum where tension should build, which keeps the piece from achieving a higher level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant scaffolding, paraphrase loops, and repetitive sentence structures. For instance, "Their task was to write the future, to chart a course through the uncharted territories of possibility" is a clear redundancy. This pattern of synonym churn and abstract summary ("Patterns and probabilities swirled") dulls momentum and obscures the story's core action in a haze of telling.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is evocative, but its momentum is dragged down in the conclusion by paraphrase loops. The story states Emilia has succeeded, then restates this success in different terms across several sentences ("unlocked a new world," "nurture the magic"). This redundancy in the final beats dilutes the power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Lena's gaze," "Lena's thoughts") and a reliance on telling over showing. Abstract phrasing like "captures the essence of the subject" and "underscoring the ephemeral nature of human emotions" pads the narrative without adding specific, sensory detail. This reduces momentum and immediacy, particularly during moments of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and scaffolding. Multiple sentences begin with "He was..." or "Kael's [noun] was...", creating a template-like cadence. The story contains numerous paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea ("He began to agonize... Kael's thoughts were a jumble... he struggled to make sense"). This redundancy severely hampers momentum and clarity, making the piece feel overwritten and static.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    While grammatically clean, the prose is burdened by abstraction and conceptual summary. There are significant issues with paraphrase loops, especially in the last few paragraphs, where the same ideas about harmony, the rosette, and hope are restated with slightly different phrasing. This repetition stalls momentum and reads as scaffolding rather than propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual paraphrase loops. Sentences are laden with intangible concepts like "essence of the past" and "energies of the universe," telling the reader what to feel rather than showing it through concrete action. There are instances of overwriting and repetitive phrasing that slow momentum, such as restating Aria's motivation in slightly different terms across adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose contains some pleasant imagery but is hindered by overwriting and a reliance on telling over showing ("with an air of determination"). Several sentences summarize emotional states ("feeling a sense of satisfaction") that should be dramatized. The final paragraphs become particularly sluggish, shifting from scene to summary and losing momentum before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean and effective at building atmosphere, but it is hampered by occasional overwriting and a tendency to summarize key moments. Phrases like "inadvertently profound presence" and "hushed blaze of energy" feel self-consciously literary. The final moments suffer from telling over showing, as seen in the line, "Eli's understanding was both exhilarating and humbling, and she knew that she had been forever changed by the experience," which functions as a label for an experience rather than its embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is clean but suffers from significant redundancy and scaffolding, particularly in the final third. There are clear paraphrase loops, such as two nearly identical descriptions of the garden's transformation appearing within a few paragraphs of each other. This repetition of information and phrasing severely drags momentum and makes the ending feel more like a summary than a resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. The idea of endlessness and obsession is restated multiple times in slightly different ways ("endless steps," "boundless confinement," "stretch on forever," "never-ending labyrinth"). This repetition, while thematic, slows momentum and reduces information density. Some figurative language feels overwrought, creating a texture that is thick but occasionally clotted.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative but marred by repetition and scaffolding. The concept of the city's noise and smog receding is stated three separate times, diminishing its impact. Several phrases verge on cliché ("kaleidoscope of faces," "sea of color and sound"). The final two paragraphs function as a paraphrase loop, restating the painter's renewed purpose and the story's theme rather than letting the final image carry the weight of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically sound but is hampered by a pervasive tendency to tell rather than show, particularly regarding character motivation and thematic significance. The final paragraphs are weakened by conceptual loops that summarize what has already been dramatized. A few strained phrases, like "rosewater dread," also betray a lack of line-level precision, preventing the prose from achieving a truly polished quality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from several distinct artifacts that impede momentum and clarity. A prominent template cadence ("As he...") creates a monotonous, list-like feel. There are instances of telling over showing ("The clock maker's heart pounded with excitement") and conceptual redundancy with words like "secrets," "hunger," and "radiance." These issues, combined, make the writing feel less crafted and more assembled from constituent parts, dulling the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by significant text artifacts that stall momentum. The repetitive sentence stem "The whispering advisor's voice..." creates a monotonous, template-like cadence. The narrative also leans on clichéd figurative language ("eyes black as coal," "labyrinthine corridors," "teetered on the edge of the abyss"), which dulls the immediacy of the otherwise strong atmosphere. These issues of craft obscure the story's potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is severely hampered by repetition and paraphrase loops, especially in the final third. Multiple paragraphs restate the same core ideas—the lingering music, the shining stars, the drifting clouds—using slightly different phrasing, which stalls momentum and dulls the closure. For example, the stars "twinkle like diamonds" and then "shone brighter," which is a near-duplicate that dilutes the final image's power. This redundancy is a significant flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear but hampered by noticeable repetition and scaffolding. Multiple paraphrase loops occur around the protagonist's motivation ("She was quietly driven," "driven by a sense of curiosity," "driven by her quietly driven nature"), which dulls momentum. The overuse of filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "Lyra saw") and similar sentence stems creates a mechanical rhythm in places, reducing the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is burdened by summary and abstraction, especially at the story's climax, which is told rather than shown ("slowly, gradually, the truth began to emerge"). There are paraphrase loops where concepts are restated in slightly different terms, slowing momentum. While grammatically clean, the line-level craft lacks the propulsion and information density of publishable work due to its reliance on telling over showing pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and abstraction. There are numerous paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences or clauses restate the same idea with different words (e.g., "a beacon in the void, a light that would guide"). This redundancy, combined with a reliance on abstract nouns, drains the narrative of momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is clean grammatically but suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops. Key terms from the prompt—"antique ink stamp," "reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve"—are repeated so often they become textual artifacts that stall momentum. This looping creates a scaffold-like feel, particularly with "antique ink stamp" appearing five times, which dulls the narrative propulsion and reads as mechanical reinforcement rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops that stall momentum. Key phrases and ideas are restated with slight variations (e.g., "shape and molded," "create, to shape, and to mold," "shaping, molding, and transforming"). This synonym churn creates a circling, static feeling that works against the narrative's progression and reads as a significant craft artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "unfiltered awakening," "intangibly tangible," and "unused potential" are looped, dulling their impact. There is a persistent reliance on telling over showing ("Amira knew she had to escape," "Amira felt a sense of purpose rising"), which stalls momentum and substitutes summary for dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but is hampered by several artifacts. The phrase "brilliant dimness" is repeated three times, becoming a distracting tic rather than a resonant motif. The final paragraphs lose momentum, bogging down in abstract, repetitive sentences that summarize theme instead of advancing the scene, and some descriptive language leans on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains striking imagery but is marred by significant line-level artifacts that harm momentum. A clear paraphrase loop occurs ("driven by a desire... driven by a need..."), and the template cadence noted in Q6 is a persistent issue. These structural repetitions dull the impact of the otherwise strong descriptive language.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from repetitive scaffolding and syntactic patterns. Phrases like "a testament to," "a reminder of," and "a symbol of" appear multiple times, creating a template-like cadence that lessens propulsion. The repetition of "the mist swirled around her" creates atmosphere but also borders on a loop. While generally clear, the reliance on these constructions dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is generally clean but marred by significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "align his heart and actions" and "gravitating towards a new sense of purpose" are repeated, creating a looping effect that dulls momentum. Several sentences restate the same idea in slightly different words, revealing a lack of concision and information density that weakens the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is hampered by repetition and declarative scaffolding. Phrases like "The labyrinth was a metaphor for..." and "The signed baseball seemed to be a tangible manifestation of that desire..." explicitly interpret the story's symbols for the reader. There are also numerous paraphrase loops and repetitive sentence stems ("As she walked...", "As she stood...", "As she gazed..."), which slows momentum and reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it relies on repetitive sentence structures ("a [noun] that was both X and Y") and summary-heavy sentences that tell instead of show. Pivotal moments, such as the nature of the transformation and the bond being reforged, are explained in abstract terms rather than rendered through concrete sensory detail. This tendency to summarize dulls the momentum at key beats, particularly during the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and generally precise, with strong imagery like "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "misty blanket." There are minor instances of scaffolding, such as the repeated use of "It was as if..." which slightly distances the reader. The rhythmic repetition of "a sense of..." in the closing paragraphs feels a bit like a template cadence, a small tic in otherwise controlled and beautiful line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose aims for a lyrical quality but is hampered by repetitive sentence structures ("As she glided," "As she entered," "As she worked," "As the hours passed") and paraphrase loops. The line "she felt the weight of their stories settling upon her" is a near-echo of an earlier sentence, which dulls momentum. These prose artifacts prevent the language from achieving consistent propulsion or information density.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "whispering hush" is overused to the point of losing its impact. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, slowing momentum ("She had always been drawn to the unusual... she had always been drawn to the mysterious..."). The final paragraphs are particularly declarative and repetitive, summarizing the change rather than rendering it through concrete, propulsive language.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clear but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and adverbs that tell rather than show ("sudden and unexplained," "calmly inventive," "revered and mysterious"). Several concepts are repeated in slightly different phrasing, creating redundancy ("a new era," "spread the message"). This reliance on modifiers and summary statements flattens the momentum, particularly during what should be tense moments.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by noticeable repetition. Phrases like "the herder's precognitively cursed nature stirred" and "the sacred patterns that governed..." appear multiple times, creating a loop that dulls momentum. This redundancy, a form of scaffolding, prevents the prose from achieving the high level of concision required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from repetition and a reliance on abstract nouns. Key thematic phrases ("cartography of scars," "hidden patterns," "turbulence") are repeated to the point of becoming thematic scaffolding rather than resonant motifs. Several sentences restate similar ideas in slightly different terms, creating a looping effect that slows momentum and reduces information density, particularly in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is hampered by repetitive sentence structures, particularly a reliance on "As he..." clauses, which creates a monotonous rhythm and slows momentum. Abstract, high-concept phrases like "dignified chaos" and "diplomatically fierce" are used as labels rather than being demonstrated through concrete detail. This tendency toward overwriting makes the prose feel dense but less impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clear and maintains a consistent rhythm, but it leans heavily on familiar, almost stock, figurative language ("treasure trove," "beacon of hope," "phoenix from the ashes"). This reliance on cliché dulls the story's impact and prevents the line-level craft from achieving true distinction. While functional, the prose lacks the sharpness and surprise expected at the highest level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative but marred by repetition and redundancy that dulls its impact. A significant paraphrase loop occurs in the final act, where the image of following the compasses toward a new horizon is stated in nearly identical terms across two separate paragraphs. This artifact reads like a lack of confidence in the initial image, weakening the story's conclusion by restating what was already effectively established.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it relies heavily on summarizing emotional states ("felt a surge of determination," "sense of urgency grew") rather than embodying them through action and specific perception. There are some instances of paraphrase loops and thematic statements that read like scaffolding. For example, "The collective memory, once a fragile entity, was now a living, breathing thing" is a direct summary that slightly dulls the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is clear but marred by significant repetition and scaffolding artifacts. Phrases like "Kaito felt," "The breeze carried," and the story's key thematic terms ("tides of remembrance," "rhythmically placid") are looped to the point of becoming a distracting, mechanical cadence. This template-like construction flattens the prose's momentum and gives it an artificial quality, particularly in the latter half where the repetition intensifies.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "gradual change" and "intricate patterns" across adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without propulsion; information density is low, with redundant reflections obscuring clarity, especially in the closure image of peace amid destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose has rhythmic variety in descriptive paragraphs, but paraphrase loops like repeated "she felt a sense of" and synonym churn (disorientation, harmony, peace) create momentum drag, especially in the final third where artifacts dull the dawn image (−0.6 applied). Information density is low with redundant scaffolding in reflective summaries that restate emotions without advancement. Overwriting in mixed metaphors, such as frost echoing the scorched testament, obscures clarity without payoff; sentence propulsion breathes but slugs in looped interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose advances atmosphere through concise, multi-job sentences like the conservatory's hum and rustle, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated peace and connection motifs) and template cadence in "she felt" stems dull momentum in the final third without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs, yet figurative muddle in "symphony of silence" mixes metaphors slightly, and information density dips in redundant emotional summaries. No major artifacts obscure closure, but scaffold redundancies apply a mild drag.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and concise with varied rhythm, advancing atmosphere through lines like the "low, mournful tone" without major loops, but occasional paraphrase redundancy, such as repeating stillness pursuits, dulls momentum slightly. Information density is solid, with sentences often multitasking, like integrating setting into action during navigation. Figurative language is controlled, avoiding muddle, but template cadence in reflective blocks triggers minor debt without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety in paragraph lengths, but paraphrase loops like repeated "gentle" and "soft" descriptors create redundancy, dulling momentum in the gathering scene. Information density is moderate, with sentences advancing atmosphere, yet template cadence in stems like "As she..." repeats across beats without payoff. Figurative language is controlled but muddles in mixed metaphors like "beacon in the darkness," and the final line propels resonance cleanly despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety with vivid images like "blossoms seemed to unfurl like tiny stars," advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive descriptions of peace and longing, such as "sense of peace settle within her" echoed later. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding in reflective blocks that summarize without propulsion. No major artifacts obscure closure, though template cadence in "As she..." openings creates slight monotony in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose advances atmosphere through vivid images like "quaking reverie," with varied rhythm and high density in garden descriptions, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive time-blurring phrases, triggering -0.4 for template cadence in the realization sequence. Clarity is maintained, yet overwriting in stacked metaphors like lotus unfolding muddles propulsion without payoff. Sentence variety supports emphasis, but some simultaneity errors imply overlap in sequential actions like reaching and image forming. No major artifacts touch closure, but minor scaffold dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose features repetitive phrasing and paraphrase loops, such as multiple restatements of hope and resilience (e.g., "beacon of hope" echoed in "shining brightly"), dulling momentum without advancing pressure. Sentence-level propulsion is sluggish with synonym churn like "patiently strategic" and "renewed determination," and figurative language muddles in mixed metaphors (e.g., "staggering grace" in action beats). Information density is low, with scaffold sentences that restate concepts, and the final line resolves mechanically without recharging motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dense, vivid prose advances atmosphere through synesthetic images, but paraphrase loops in memory sections, like repeated fading whispers, create minor momentum drag without obscuring closure; syntactic variety supports rhythm, with no major artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "ethereal light," "golden sunset," and "moonbeams" across adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Overwriting in peak beats, such as the tingling atmosphere shift, obscures clarity with mixed metaphors and template cadence. Information density is low due to redundancies, though final line resolves with resonant imagery; artifacts touch closure, harming propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.7)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops, such as repeated "thawing heart" and synonym churn around renewal, dulling momentum; figurative muddle like "weighty lightness" contradicts without payoff, and template cadence in sentences starting with "As" obscures clarity; information density is low, with redundancies stalling the closure image of the orb.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose features repetitive stems like "I felt a" across multiple sentences, creating paraphrase loops that dull momentum, especially in the reflective buildup to decryption. Information density is moderate with some multi-job lines, but overwriting in abstract summaries like "the revelation had shaken me to my core" obscures propulsion without advancing pressure. Rhythm varies somewhat, yet template cadence in the ending's assertions harms clarity at closure; no major artifacts touch causality, but accumulation caps non-closure slips.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose features vivid metaphors like "words dripped like honey," but suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn around "hush," "silence," and "darkness," dulling momentum in the narrative weaving beat. Information density is inconsistent, with redundant scaffolding in repeated storm descriptions that don't advance atmosphere. Rhythm varies but template cadence in sentence openings (e.g., "The oracle...") creates monotony; artifacts touch closure by obscuring the transformation's clarity. Clarity is maintained, but overwriting muddles propulsion without purposeful effect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, such as repeated "remarkably composed" and "frozen courtyard" variations that dull momentum without payoff, triggering -0.6 for template cadence in reflective blocks. Information density is low in redundant sentences like the multiple endings emphasizing peace, obscuring the closure image. Rhythm varies little, with syntactic monotony in whirring limbs and gazing motifs, though clarity remains functional.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops, like repeated "sense of resolve/peace/clarity" and synonym churn around silence/hush, dulling momentum in the monolith climax. Overwriting with mixed metaphors, such as "air vibrated with a resonant hush" and "wrapped like a shroud," creates figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence propulsion is sluggish from template cadence in "she [action], the [object] still clutched." High artifact debt obscures closure image, triggering penalties without high density or varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and dense, with vivid images like "cracked collection of marbles" advancing atmosphere, but repetitive phrasing around polishing creates minor paraphrase loops in the middle, slightly dulling momentum. Sentence variety supports propulsion, avoiding syntactic monotony, and final line recharges motifs effectively. No major artifacts obscure closure, though some synonym churn in descriptions like "blooming withering" feels templated.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose has rhythmic variety in descriptive passages, but paraphrase loops like repeated "sense of" (satisfaction, awe, wonder, excitement) and synonym churn around warmth/chill dull momentum in the climax. Information density is moderate, with sentences advancing atmosphere, but figurative muddle in "icy warmth" contradicts without payoff, harming closure clarity. No major grammar issues, but template cadence in action sequences like "As she [action], Kaelin [felt/thought]" repeats thrice, triggering -0.4. Opening anchors voice, but final line redundantly echoes theme.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose has rhythmic lulls from paraphrase loops like repeated "felt" and "as she" stems, dulling momentum in discovery beats; information density is moderate with multi-job sentences, but overwriting in water imagery creates muddle without payoff; clarity is maintained, yet template cadence in the ending ("As she...") triggers artifact penalty, obscuring the closure's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like the swaying illustration, but paraphrase loops in margin-occupying descriptions (e.g., repeated boundary probes) dull momentum without payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, though template cadence in "As she" openings clusters in mid-beats, triggering minor artifact deduction. Clarity holds with strong verbs, but figurative muddle in "auroral sorrow" mixes metaphors without full coherence in peak realization. No major errors touch closure, keeping propulsion functional.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose has rhythmic variety and sensory density, advancing atmosphere through lines like "morbid perfume that clung," but paraphrase loops appear in repeated footsteps echoes and synonym churn around decay scents. Information is concise overall, yet some redundancy in alertness descriptions dulls momentum without obscuring closure. No major artifacts touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose has rhythmic variety and sensory density, but paraphrase loops like repeated "regenerative silence" and "drift of untold seasons" create redundancy without advancing momentum, deducting for template cadence in adjacent sentences. Information density is moderate, with lines like "the air was heavy" doing atmosphere work, but overwriting in stacked scents and whispers muddles peak beats without payoff. Clarity is maintained, though synonym churn (e.g., "shroud" and "miasma") dulls propulsion in the burrowing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with vivid rhythm and density, varying sentences to build momentum, but paraphrase loops like repeated "ordinary magic" and "sense of connection" create redundancy without advancing pressure, especially in the contemplative song shift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeating "mirrored horizon" and "symmetry" across adjacent sentences without advancing pressure, dulling the closure image. Figurative muddle in mixed metaphors, such as "shard of ice piercing the sky" clashing with "soft, golden light," obscures clarity in peak beats. Information density is low due to redundancies like multiple dawn light descriptions, and syntactic monotony creates drumbeat rhythm in tracing the map. These artifacts pervade the final third, harming propulsion without purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose features vivid images like "misty veil that shrouded the city" but suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated glow and darkness descriptions) and template cadence in sentences starting with "The" or "She," deducting for momentum drag without payoff. Information density is moderate, with sentences advancing atmosphere, but overwriting in peak beats like labyrinth navigation muddles clarity; no major grammar issues, yet redundancy obscures the closure image slightly. Rhythm varies somewhat, but stock metaphors like "fabric of reality" reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is poetic with vivid images, but paraphrase loops like repeated "faint rustle of turning seasons" and "mirrored hush" create redundancy, dulling momentum in the final third without payoff. Information density is moderate, with some sentences advancing atmosphere, but overwriting in stacked metaphors like "womb nurturing" muddles clarity at emotional peaks. Rhythm varies, yet template cadence in descriptive runs triggers artifact penalty, obscuring the closure image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety in descriptive passages, but paraphrase loops like repeated "tranquility" and "shadows" in adjacent sentences dull momentum, especially in the courtyard buildup; information density is high in sensory details, yet overwriting in peak reflection obscures propulsion without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "glowing" and "felt a sense of" in adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without payoff. Information density is low due to redundancies, such as multiple nostalgia pangs, and template cadence in reflective blocks obscures closure clarity. Figurative language is muddled in peak beats, like "crystal shadows" recurring without propulsion, triggering artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety in sentence length and purposeful repetition for lyric effect, but paraphrase loops like multiple "texture of time" iterations create redundancy without advancing momentum. Information density is moderate, with lines often multi-tasking atmosphere and theme, yet template cadence in stems like "As she [action]" dulls propulsion in the patterning sequence. No major artifacts obscure closure, but overwriting in stacked descriptors like "warm, ethereal glow" muddles peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has rhythmic flow in atmospheric descriptions, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "chronic hush" variations) and synonym churn (e.g., "stillness," "silence," "hush") create momentum drag, especially in the ending where they dull the closure image, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Information density is moderate, with some sentences advancing atmosphere but others redundant (e.g., multiple hush unraveled mentions). Syntactic variety is present, but template cadence in footsteps echoes reduces propulsion. No major grammar issues, but overwriting in metaphors like "morbid perfume" muddles clarity without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose has rhythmic variety but suffers from paraphrase loops, such as repeated descriptions of the grotto's glow and her detachment in adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without payoff. Information density is moderate, with some sentences advancing atmosphere, but overwriting in figurative stacks like "warm, honey-like light" and "ethereal glow" creates muddle in peak crafting moments.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeating "reclaimed stillness" and "dappled resolve" across adjacent lines without advancing momentum; template cadence in sentences starting with "As she" creates monotony. Information density is low due to redundant scaffolding, obscuring the closure image in the final ascent. Figurative language is overwrought and muddled in peak beats, such as the stamp's "tangible connection" without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose advances atmosphere with high density in images like "crystalline spires glinting like a shard of fallen starlight," but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating "shape and mold" grief) and synonym churn in emotional descriptions dull momentum slightly, especially in the reflective blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "geode crystal clutched" and "intangibly tangible," dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Sentence rhythm varies somewhat, but template cadence in openings like "As she..." creates monotony, with low density in redundant descriptions. Figurative language muddles in peak beats, such as "bleak exhilaration" restated without propulsion, though grammar is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose has some vivid imagery like "stars twinkling like diamonds," but suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "sense of excitement" and "brilliant dimness") and template cadence in discovery beats, dulling momentum; information density is moderate, with overwriting in descriptive passages obscuring propulsion at the chip insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "weight," "secrets," "gloom" across adjacent lines), dulling momentum without advancing atmosphere; template cadence in reflective sentences (e.g., "As she...") triggers penalty. Overwriting with mixed metaphors (waves as sighs, carvings as fingers) muddles clarity in peak beats like the memory formation. Information density is low, with redundant scaffolding stalling propulsion; final line resolves weakly via image repetition. No major grammar issues, but rhythmic uniformity creates drumbeat effect.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, such as repeated "mist swirling" and "weight" motifs across adjacent sentences, dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Information density is low in overwritten descriptions like "storm-worn windblown parapet," with mixed metaphors obscuring clarity in peak beats. The final paragraph's redundant echoes of peace and mist exemplify template cadence touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn, like repeated "sense of" phrases and navigation metaphors that dull momentum without advancing pressure; information density is low in reflective blocks, with template cadence in sentences like "As he [action], Jack felt [emotion]," obscuring the closure image despite clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    Prose has atmospheric rhythm but suffers from paraphrase loops, such as repeated mist swirling and weight lifting, dulling momentum; synonym churn around "ethereal glow" and "otherworldly light" obscures propulsion without payoff, especially in the repetitive ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose advances atmosphere with vivid, concise images like "trees bore fruits that shone like tiny lanterns," varying rhythm naturally, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeating steadiness paradox) dull momentum slightly without touching closure. Information density high in ritual beats, with strong verbs and specific details, though figurative language stacks in the climax without muddle. No major artifacts obscure cause-effect, supporting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose advances atmosphere and character through dense, multi-job sentences with varied rhythm and syntactic variety, like the opening's ethereal glow setup. Clarity is high with concise imagery, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "sense of" stems in reflective blocks) and mixed metaphors (choking beauty clinging to breath) dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Information density is strong in peak beats, with strong verbs and specific nouns; final line recharges motifs effectively. Minor template cadence in mid-story reflections triggers a small deduction, but no major artifacts touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety and concision, with sentences advancing atmosphere through images like stitching narratives, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive phrases such as "faint shimmer of long-dried tears," dulling momentum without payoff. Information density is high in memory weaves, yet overwriting in ethereal descriptions muddles peak beats, like the glowing Tear. No major artifacts obscure closure, but template cadence in emotional summaries reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive loops, such as "whispering hush" appearing over a dozen times, creating template cadence and momentum drag, especially in the accumulative build-up. Information density is low with paraphrase redundancies like restating Aria's fascination and transformation across paragraphs without advancement. Figurative language muddles in peak moments, like the overstacked "texture of transformation" metaphor, obscuring clarity at closure. Artifacts touch the ending beat, triggering a -1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally, with no high propulsion or varied rhythm to redeem.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing like "silent revolution" and synonym loops (glow, light, illuminate) create paraphrase churn, dulling momentum in the final third without pattern payoff. Sentence-level propulsion lags with template cadence in echoed footsteps and whispers, and overwriting in stacked modifiers obscures clarity at activation. Information density is low due to redundant beats, though grammar is clean; these artifacts touch closure by flattening the glowing beacon's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose features high density with vivid images like "aurora-lit horizon" advancing atmosphere, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "stirring" of curse and "sacred patterns") and template cadence in rock placement descriptions dull momentum without payoff. Overwriting stacks metaphors in peak beats, such as the shimmering air and vision kaleidoscope, creating figurative muddle that obscures the closure image. Rhythm varies somewhat, but redundant stems like "the herder's" repeat across sentences, reducing propulsion; clarity holds despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lyrical with high density and varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated storm and scar descriptions) create minor redundancy without fully advancing momentum in mid-beats. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though some synonym churn (e.g., turmoil/turbulence/tempest) dulls propulsion slightly. No major artifacts touch closure, and information advances atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has rhythmic variety and concision in descriptive passages, but paraphrase loops like repeating the card's significance and sundial's codes create redundancy without advancing momentum, especially in reflective blocks exceeding BRR allowance. Information density is moderate, with sentences often multitasking atmosphere and character, yet template cadence in fencing descriptions (e.g., "his mechanical arm moving with precision") dulls propulsion. No major artifacts obscure closure, but overwriting in the ending's glow and shadows muddles the final image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose features vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops like repeated "sense of purpose" and "hope" churn dilute momentum without advancing pressure; information density is moderate, with some scaffolding in reflective blocks, though the final survey of handiwork propels toward closure without major artifacts obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is concise with high density in images like "vortex of sound" advancing atmosphere, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated mist swirling) and template cadence in music descriptions dull momentum slightly without harming closure. Rhythm varies naturally, syntax propels beats, and figurative language is controlled, though dense in peak moments like the encore; no major artifacts obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is lyrical with vivid images like "tentative fingers" reaching for sunlight, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated emphasis on blooming, hum, and urgency) and template cadence in sentence openings reduce density and propulsion. Information advances atmosphere but redundancies like multiple monsoon mentions stall momentum without purpose. No major artifacts obscure closure, but overwriting in peak descriptions muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in wave-like sentences that advance atmosphere, but occasional paraphrase loops, like repeating "tides of remembrance," slightly dull momentum without full pattern payoff. Figurative language, such as "cerulean regret," is purposeful and coherent, integrated into action without muddle. Final line recharges motifs effectively, but some stock openers like "As he worked" add minor scaffold in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and vivid specificity (“soft scratching sound”). A few soft loops—“symphonies of truth” repeated without new inflection—dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter, but the final paragraph leans on abstract uplift rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but loops of “breathing building” and “trembling heart” dilute impact. Some sentences do double duty; others paraphrase (“the world seemed to slow down, allowing her to savor…”). No major artifacts in closure, yet rhythm could be tighter under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language (“paper trails…woven with the precision of a master seamstress”) is apt. Occasional soft-focus phrasing (“bloom of withering”) edges toward poetic excess but does not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; no loops or clichés, rhythm breathes with scene. Some lines achieve double duty: image plus emotional cue. Minor overwriting appears in clusters like “fractured hush that vibrated with palpable energy,” a mixed metaphor, holding this from 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and often elegant, yet prone to paraphrase loops (“footsteps echoed… corridors… corridors…”) and filler phrases that dilute momentum. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally generic (“labyrinthine corridors”).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Almost zero scaffolding; only occasional soft-landing repetitions (“path that had previously disappeared reappeared”). Dense yet clear, with sonic balance and purposeful enjambment. One near-cliché (“gentle lapping of waves”) costs minor 0.3.

    Prose is fluid and sensory, with rhythmic variation. Minor loops (“colors dancing… dusky harmony”) and filter phrases (“seemed to”) appear but do not stall momentum. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; however, mild paraphrase loops (“price of redemption” restated) and stock phrases (“ancient terrace… testament to countless negotiations”) dilute density. No major artifacts, yet compression could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is elegant but occasionally drifts into poetic redundancy (“gentle reminder of the world’s beauty” after snow already established). No loops or scaffolds. Metaphors are coherent. Density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Minor overwriting in final paragraph keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythm varied; occasional scaffold such as “As she... / As the...” repetition cycles lightly without muddling causality. No closure artifacts observed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid and vivid, but occasional soft-focus phrasing—“otherworldly light,” “perfect harmony”—leans decorative. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies. A few elevated diction choices slightly exceed Aria’s grounded persona yet remain coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “gentle hiss and crackle” followed by “gentle, snowmelt ardor” repeats the adjective without added pressure. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly free of loops; occasional elevated phrasing (“precisely playful grace”) edges toward purple but does not stall momentum. Information density is high; metaphors remain coherent. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but figurative density borders on excess in the middle third (“twilight and stardust,” “celestial rhythms”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“wings of a dusky harmony”) slightly muddies the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns (“harmony,” “release,” “grace”) that cushion urgency. Some paraphrase loops (“reminder of the power of harmony…reminder that harmony was possible”) dull momentum. No line-level artifacts in the closure beat, yet density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmer of twilight frost like a still pond”) flirt with excess but stay legible. No loops or filter-verb clusters. Strong cadence control.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous in nature”) momentarily lifts out of Elara’s earthy lexicon but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but repeated “brightened disquiet” and similar phrasing create minor loops; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is competent, lush but occasionally padded (“nestled between the pages of a rare, leather-bound tome”). No looping paraphrases, but a surplus of abstract summary in climactic beats blurs immediacy and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are generally clear and propulsive, but mild paraphrase loops (“her understanding… forever altered… her understanding of the fables”) and stacked modifiers (“deeply significant, hidden pattern”) dilute density. No figurative muddle in peak beats, yet the closing paragraph repeats earlier phrasing without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“storm of vibrations,” “bloom of hush”) are coherent and purposeful. High information density without overwriting. Final cadence satisfies the ear.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“as they walked… as they did”). Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high, though some phrases verge on purple (“velvet expanse”).

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “stood there” repeated in closing beats; no loops obscure closure. Density is high, yet some sentences lean on abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vivid sensory selection, no redundancy or overwritten passages. A single mild filter-verb sequence in middle paragraph triggers -0.15, but overall rhythm and clarity carry through closure. Final image of jade cicada against dawn light resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but repeated abstract phrasing—“intangibly tangible presence,” “gilded hush”—creates minor loops that dilute density; no line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid, occasionally lush; one mixed metaphor (“vaulting hush”) but clarity intact. No loops or scaffold. Information density is high; sentences multitask. Rhythm supports mood; minor overwriting in “mesmerizing liquid that swirled and eddied.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive, but leans on stock phrases (“weight of her quest settling upon her shoulders”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is good; each sentence advances scene or mood. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional poetic layering (“dark tentacles,” “loaded emptiness”) flirts with overwriting but stays within pattern. One paraphrase loop near the middle (“the keeper’s presence was a catalyst…”) dulls momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentences flow cleanly with modest rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained, though metaphors sometimes default to the cosmic (“fabric of reality”). Occasional filler (“soft glow,” “strange energy”) could be pruned for density. Closure beat is clear and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is elegant yet occasionally loops: “standing waves revealed… the truth began to reveal itself.” Metaphors are coherent, but stacked lyrical phrases create slight density drag. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is evocative but occasionally overwritten: “shivering bliss” appears twice, and “shape of possibility” is repeated without new inflection. Metaphors are coherent but dense; a few filter verbs (“they felt”) dull immediacy. No loops or typos; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, but occasional scaffold phrases (“she was no longer just an archivist, but…”) and mild overwriting (“sanctuary of remembrance” twice) dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; sentences advance image or mood. Minor scaffold: “the sound of gentle lapping of water against the shore created a soothing melody” could be tighter. A few stock phrases (“heartbeat of the rebellion”) dull specificity. No artifacts obstruct closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely repeats within beats. Minor loops—“mist swirls,” “tendrils of fog”—recur but serve pattern. Sentence rhythm breathes with the music. No clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm and density serve atmosphere; occasional ornamental metaphor (moon-whisper secret) is minor. No loops, high sensory integration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic; minor scaffold appears (“the sound of the waterfall grew…”) but does not stall momentum. Figurative language is purposeful, though a few soft modifiers (“gentle energy,” “soft, ethereal light”) dilute peak beats slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, with high information density and varied rhythm. One paraphrase loop (“rain-washed foundry… rain continued to fall”) and a few near-redundant phrases (“remnants of her life’s work… remnants of her past”) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and atmospheric, but occasional loops (“mist swirled… mist swirled”) and soft filler (“a sense of”) dull momentum. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; no mixed metaphors intrude. Density is high enough for the length, yet a few scaffold phrases remain.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears (“memories came flooding back”), but no loops obscure causality. Sentence variety supports momentum. No artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is musical and dense, but occasional stacked metaphors (“canvas waiting to be filled with the stories she was destined to tell”) dilute clarity; no loops or scaffolds, yet overwriting nudges the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose breathes under atmospheric pressure—short pulse of finding logbook, slower linger on ghosts crystallizing. Near-loop “dust accumulates… dust… dust trail” is minor; clarity intact. Metaphors are spare and physical (“hum of the mainspring”) rather than ornament for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and often lovely (“soft susurrations weaving in and out”), but slight loops appear (“patterns shifting and reforming” echoed later). Density is moderate; some sentences could be trimmed without loss. No major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not purple. Occasional template cadence (“the words flowing like a river”) is minor. No loops or scaffold. High information density: each sentence layers image or stakes. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers atmosphere or process. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“tear in the fabric of silence”) and paid off. Minor register drift (“philosopher’s stone”) is genre-motivated. Final cadence is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is dense but patterned. A few soft loops (“resonant hush” twice, “mysteries” thrice) and minor scaffold (“she felt… she felt…”) slightly dull momentum. No clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm breathes with the swell, clauses mimicking surf; however, a few stacked “perpetually,” “always,” and “turbine-hum reverie” border on repetition. Compression is excellent except for those mild loops.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is largely smooth and free of repetitive loops. Small clusters of near-paraphrase (“luna felt…”, “luna began to…”) appear but do not stall momentum. Metaphor remains controlled; one mixed image (“moonlight’s gentle caress” set against “etched glass”) is forgiven inside lyrical allowance. Meets craft bar for publication if not exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet disciplined, with varied sentence lengths that echo the zeppelin’s drift. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“swirl of memories and emotions”) edge toward abstraction but do not clog momentum. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Metaphors are coherent, though a few (“searing reverie”) flirt with excess heat without embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is evocative and largely loop-free, but occasional soft scaffolding (“the alchemist’s thoughts turned…”) and stacked abstract nouns (“revival and rebirth, of a community reborn”) slightly dilute propulsion. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lyrical and generally clear, but repeated abstract phrases (“emotional patterns,” “accidental prophecy”) create mild synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent; no artifacts obstruct causality. Density is high, yet some sentences restate mood without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and strong cadence. Minor loops (“she knew that…”) and soft intensifiers (“overwhelming,” “unlike any other”) slightly dull edge. No artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is fluid and mostly free of loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. A few soft modifiers (“gentle,” “subtle”) could be pruned for density, and the final paragraph drifts toward summary, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly propulsive, but repeated abstract phrasing (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) creates synonym loops that dull impact. No mixed metaphors or grammatical slips, yet density could be higher; several sentences restate prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, but occasional soft filler (“began to,” “seemed to”) and stacked modifiers (“faint, otherworldly glow”) slightly dilute urgency. No loops or mixed metaphors; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, but repeated phrases (“timekeeper’s gaze,” “emerald silo”) and stacked modifiers create mild loop artifacts that dull momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft loops (“gentle lapping… soothing melody”) and stacked modifiers (“burnished hush that wrapped around her like a shroud”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure clarity. No artifacts in closure beat. Density is moderate; some sentences could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, with pleasing cadence and selective sensory detail. Minor loop: “the caretaker… the caretaker…” openings recur. No mixed metaphors or purple drift. Density is good; every paragraph advances atmosphere or caretaker intent. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; rhythm varies, imagery is precise. Minor synonym churn (“glow,” “luminescent,” “radiance”) and soft filter verbs slightly dilute propulsion, but no artifact obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm pleasant but repetition of “blooming” and “seed” in 2-sentence bursts. Some overwriting: “narrow vastness,” “gloom-hill” appear decorative. Occasional scaffold loops: jetty/blooming/landscape sentence clusters retell rather than tighten. Clarity intact; artifacts mild.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean, sensory compression—“creosote and ash” vs “tiny miracle”—and only two brief redundant stems; momentum stays intact, no figurative muddle at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean and propulsive, but occasional soft loops (“the stars twinkling like diamonds” appears twice) and elevated diction (“insatiable urge”) slightly dilute immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat, and sentence rhythm modulates effectively under the final step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich. A few stock phrases (“gaze out into the void,” “steeped themselves”) and mild overwriting (“the very fabric of reality began to unravel”) dull edge. No loops or grammar slips. High information density overall.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional elevated diction (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) risks register drift yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush yet occasionally loops—“shadows that danced like restless spirits” followed by “shadows on the walls began to coalesce” feels redundant. Strong rhythmic control overall, but density of figurative language in final third slightly blurs the closure image. No mechanical errors; minor scaffold present.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; only minor loop (“the tutor… the tutor…”) and a few stacked modifiers (“expectant hush that wrapped…”) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich; occasional stacked metaphors (“towers of bone pierced the sky like shattered splinters”) verge on excess but do not muddle causality. No loops or scaffold detected. High information density maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control, high information density; figurative language is purposeful. Minor scaffold: “creaked and groaned” repeated. No mixed metaphors. Final image is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and sensory; minor loops (“as she worked…”) and elevated diction in spots, but no artifacts near closure. High information density; sentences often do two jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition that teaches the pattern. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt”) appear but do not stall momentum or cloud the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally lean and vivid, but repeated stems (“as she…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“a sense of…”) dull momentum; no figurative muddle at climax, yet minor scaffolding accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive, but occasional template cadence (“As they…”) and mild overwriting (“complex and often contradictory nature”) dull peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose leans on atmospheric fillers (“seemed to echo,” “felt the weight”) that pad rather than propel. Figurative language occasionally blooms, but stock images—mist curls, sentinel lighthouse—clutter final lines without accruing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, with purposeful cadence shifts. Minor scaffold: “the creek continued to rise” appears twice in close proximity; “glimmered” recurs without pattern payoff. Metaphors (“maze of dusty relics”) are functional, not strained. No loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lyrical and propulsive, but occasional purple stacks (“living, breathing entity, pulsing with a malevolent energy”) slightly dilute urgency. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. Final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and vivid nouns. A few loops (“sense of wonder,” “secrets of the shell”) and mild scaffold (“as she worked”) dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or grammar slips. Density is good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid with rhythmic variation; some abstract nouns and mild loops (“the feeling was…”) but no dense scaffold. Metaphors coherent. Occasional filter verbs (“I felt”) do not stall momentum. No artifacts in closure beat. Could trim redundancy for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length; rhythm supports meditative tempo. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained, though “trembling calm” is repeated without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job—keeping the piece from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Density is high; some sentence stems recur for mood, but variation keeps propulsion. Figure-for-figure craftsmanship compensates; no loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sentences breathe with deliberate rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—until “the hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down” repeats twice, a minor cadence hiccup. High information density, no mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional cosmic abstractions edge toward overwriting (“cosmic illusions,” “melody that echoed through eternity”) but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold. Strong cadence control.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, sensory, and mostly propulsive; a few redundant prepositional phrases (“with a soft click,” “with renewed intensity”) create minor drag. No loops or mixed metaphors, but density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, yet loops of near-synonyms (“sense of stillness wash over her,” “calming the turmoil within her”) dilute momentum. Figurative language is decorative rather than pressure-heightening; no artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, with selective sensory detail and minimal loops. One paraphrase loop (“As she worked… As she packed”) is minor. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“nexus of human connection”) edges toward abstraction but does not obscure clarity or stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are clear and rhythmic, but mild loops appear (“the archivist’s work… the archivist’s work…”). Figurative language is restrained and coherent. No overwriting in peak beats; minor scaffold phrases keep it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and selective detail. Minor scaffold: “As the night wore on” appears twice in three sentences; “the station became a hub” restates prior beat. No figurative muddle, but momentum stalls in summary patches.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical and dense; metaphors rarely repeat, rhythm varies. Minor scaffold: “quiet blaze” appears twice without reweighting until final line. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Clarity intact; closure image sharp. One mixed metaphor—“mapmaker was its instrument”—does not obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional figurative layering (“fabric of space-time was as fragile as a spider's web”) risks overwriting yet never stalls momentum or muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and image-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“orchestrate them into a symphony”) fits the lyric mode. No loops or scaffold. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to”) do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings. A few loops (“trail of artistic creations…each piece a reflection…”) and near-paraphrase restatements dull propulsion. No mixed metaphors or major artifacts, but density could be higher; some scaffolding sentences could be excised without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and imagistic, but mild loops appear: “sound waves…resonated…vibrations” and “glow…glow…light” within two sentences. No mixed metaphors, yet density dips into decorative repetition. Sentence rhythm breathes with the beats, and no scaffolding stalls momentum. Clean grammar and tense.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“chorus of restless spirits”) skirts purple but stays within atmospheric bounds. Information density is solid; sentences advance image or motion. No typos or tense slips. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) do not accumulate. Final third remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentences breathe with rhythmic variation and selective sensory detail. Occasional paraphrase loops (“the guardian’s presence…”) and stock phrasing (“the silence that remained was almost palpable”) dull momentum without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but stacked prepositional phrases and repeated “the weight of” create mild loop drag. Metaphors (“cradle the weight of the world”) verge on cliché yet remain legible. No line-level artifacts obscure causality; momentum is steady if occasionally languid.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; longer cadences open, then compress under pressure (“Without thinking, Kael slipped…”). Information density is high—each paragraph advances atmosphere or choice. Minor scaffold: “the sea’s secrets whispered in her ear” is a stock closing gesture, not quite earned by prior particulars. Otherwise clean, vivid, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates toward the final hush. Occasional elevated diction (“poignant reminder”) is voice-motivated and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is musical and dense; occasional metaphor stacks risk overwriting (“canvas of white silk,” “river breaking its banks”) but pattern is taught early and held. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or pressure. A few near-simultaneous participial phrases slightly blur action order but do not impede closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clean and propulsive, with only minor paraphrase loops (“the painter… continued to awaken… continued to work”). Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors intrude. Density is moderate—some beats could compress further—but clarity is never compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with selective sensory detail. Occasional soft-focus abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “essence of the laboratory”) slightly dilute density, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid, with strong verbs and selective figurative language. Occasional mild loop (“as they worked… as they worked”) and elevated diction (“transcended their individual sorrow”) nudge down from 8.0. No artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but repetitive cadences (“as she worked… as the rain… as the first hints”) dull momentum. No line-level artifacts touch closure, yet density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lyrical and propulsive, but figurative layering becomes dense in visionary climax; minor synonym loops (“atoms of nostalgia” / “secrets they held”) dull final impact. No mechanical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and vivid diction. Occasional abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “shape of hope”) slightly dilute density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; metaphors remain coherent. High-band polish marred only by soft, summary phrasing near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but mild paraphrase loops (“shimmering stillness,” “mist swirling”) and stacked modifiers dilute propulsion. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is dense but patterned, serving atmosphere. One mixed metaphor (“earth yielding like a reluctant confidant”) momentarily blurs physical logic yet does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; selective figurative language supports mood. A few stacked metaphors (“autumn leaves on a gusty day”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and vivid imagery. However, stacked modifiers (“celestial ballet,” “velvet expanse,” “ethereal glow”) create density without added pressure. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative surplus nudges toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; only minor loops (“glowing dune” repeated twice in close succession). Metaphors stay coherent (“fractured lullaby” threads through). One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction sneaks in—but does not mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with selective sensory detail. Minor loops (“the hum of insight grew louder” appears three times) and near-paraphrase stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final third avoids overwriting, but the closing cadence feels repetitive rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; figurative language is restrained. Some near-repetition (“footsteps quiet,” “mist-shrouded”) and stock phrasing (“weight of their quest”) slightly dull the edge. No artifacts obstruct closure clarity. Clean copy, moderate propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; selective sensory detail avoids checklist syndrome. However, repeated abstract phrasing (“sense of peace,” “sense of renewal”) and a few paraphrase loops dull momentum. No artifact appears in the closure beat, so the cap remains lenient.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of loops; occasional syntactic elongation slows momentum without obscuring causality. Metaphors (“eyes like two glittering stars”) are familiar but unobtrusive. No artifacts in closure beat. Density is adequate for length, yet summary patches dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm ebbs like tides—short drum taps then fluid wave lines, no repetitive scaffold. A couple near-identical sentence openings (“Maya’s...”) could be trimmed but do not stall propulsion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, though occasional lyrical stacking (“thunderous serenity,” “celestial map”) edges toward overwriting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or interior motion. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and sensory-rich, but repetitive sentence stems (“As she…”, “The plants…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“she felt… she knew…”) create mild drag. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and often elegant, but occasional loops (“seemed to be reaching,” “seemed to be lulling”) and stacked soft verbs dull propulsion. No mixed metaphors or major artifacts, yet density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished, with rhythmic variety and strong sensory detail. Occasional stacked metaphors (“luminescent ache,” “threads of reality”) risk overwriting but do not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentences are lean, propulsive, and image-rich. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral patterns,” “conceptual contemplation”) edges toward register drift but remains within Kael’s heightened perception. Minor filter verbs (“seemed to be made”) are rare.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean and atmospheric, with only occasional soft modifiers; no loops or mixed metaphors, though a few sentences verge on ornamental rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Occasional near-paraphrase (“sense of continuity,” “continuity she had worked to establish”) but loops are sparse and do not touch closure. Metaphors stay coherent—quiet literally engraved on stone. High information density: one sentence often performs description, interiority, and world-state update.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid, occasionally indulgent in atmospheric strings; minor scaffold like “its whispers continued” repeats concept lightly without harm. Sensory specificity is high; images rarely compete for turf. No grammatical drift or clarity issues at closure. Some abstract nouns (“energies,” “presence”) could trim for sharper punch.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and readable, but density is diluted by paraphrase loops (“truth… hidden truths… uncover the truth”) and filler scaffolding (“As she turned to leave…”). Metaphors are serviceable yet familiar (“orbits of regret,” “mist swallowed her whole”). No grammatical slips, but rhythm could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally propulsive and image-dense, but recurrent soft-focus phrases (“gentle susurrus,” “weight of the stars”) create minor loops. No single artifact harms clarity at closure, yet trimming 5–6 near-duplicates would sharpen the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; occasional loops (“the mandala was a reflection…”) repeat without adding pressure. Metaphors stay coherent; no line-level artifacts in closure beat. Density is high, momentum steady.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops. One mixed metaphor (“embers from a dying fire” beside “shattered sky”) is minor. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet purposeful; occasional soft loops (“echoes grew… echoes began”) are minor. Figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle. Strong cadence control in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. Minor loop risk in “light painting…light sources…light of dawn,” but rhythm variation prevents monotony. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; “willowglass hope” is the lone purple patch, quickly grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but loops of “she felt,” “she knew,” and “the cave was” dull momentum. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mesmerizing display of bioluminescent organisms”) verge on purple without pattern pay-off.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional soft loops (“the turner’s work was not done; rather, it was just beginning”) are minor. Metaphors (harp-string hum, crucible) are apt and not over-stacked. No line-level artifacts impair closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but “mist swirled around her” and variants loop; one mixed metaphor (“skeletal fingers against the grey”) slightly jars.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, yet prone to gentle redundancy (“soft lapping… soothing melody… gentle lapping”). No loops or scaffold, but figurative language clusters without pattern payoff. Clarity is high; momentum drifts in reflective stretches. Final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “as if”) slightly dilutes pressure. Metaphors stay coherent; no overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft fillers—“as if,” “seemed to”—slightly cushion impact. No mixed metaphors or loops, but density could be tighter under word-limit pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Syntax lilts gracefully, balancing long and short phrases to echo tidal rhythm.  One over-lavish clause—“musty scent of aged parchment and the gentle hum…”—leans purple but doesn’t derail.  No looped scaffold; pronouns and prop handling stay clean.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, with varied sentence lengths and vivid, purposeful imagery. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle lapping,” “soft, diffused light”) verge on filler but never stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors; clarity remains high through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is clean but loops: “Lyra felt a shiver… Lyra felt a thrill… Lyra felt a sense” becomes template cadence. Abstract labels (“sense of possibility,” “sense of gratitude,” “sense of purpose”) replace concrete image. No line-level artifact obscures causality, yet density is low and rhythmic variety limited.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with strong sensory specificity. Minor loops—“the music seemed,” “Lyra felt”—and stacked modifiers slightly dilute propulsion. No clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally fluid, with strategic rhythmic echo and dense sensory diction. Occasional scaffolding—“the portrait began to take on a life of its own, capturing not just …”—is mild and doesn’t cloud closure. No looping redundancies. Final sentence earns quiet lift with “the world … a little more full of possibility.”

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, but figurative layering drifts into soft repetition (“spongey dread,” “strange energy”) without fresh pressure. Information density is moderate; some sentences paraphrase prior content. No artifacts obscure closure, yet no line-level brilliance elevates it.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; figurative language is restrained. A few stock phrases (“river of light,” “ashes of never”) dull impact. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty. No line-level artifacts obscure causality. Final paragraph leans summary but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“poignant example,” “conceptual repricing”) feels slightly above Kael’s implied register but never muddies clarity. High information density without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean, with rhythmic variation and few loops. Occasional stock phrasing (“gentle glow,” “deep sense of connection”) and mild overwriting in final third dull precision. No artifacts obscure causality, yet density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean and readable, yet loops of near-synonyms (“swirling,” “twisted,” “writhing”) and stock phrases (“heavy with the scent”) dilute density. No line-level artifact blocks clarity, but compression is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is dense but patterned, suiting the accumulative design. Minor loops (“secrets only she could hear…whispered tales”) and near-paraphrase (“hidden pathways…secret pathways”) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor loop: “the darkness within her” appears twice in close proximity. One mixed metaphor—“threads of her own making” to “inlay meaning everywhere”—slightly muddies the spell’s mechanics, preventing 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, occasionally lyrical, but leans on familiar phrasing (“spark of determination,” “hollow victory”). No loops or mixed metaphors, yet density is moderate; several sentences could compress. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhythm breathes well with alternating short / long phrases; some filter-verb stacks (“seemed to whisper… seemed to be responding…”) and near-paraphrases mildly dull propulsion but never stall the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; each sentence layers salt, gear, moonlight, or creel into motion. Occasional soft-focus abstractions (“conceptual repricing”) slightly dilute density, but no loops or scaffold stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences flow with rhythmic variation; occasional near-repetition (“latent radiance,” “resonant hush”) lightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is coherent, though one mixed metaphor (“heartbeat of hesitation”) momentarily jars. No line-level artifacts obstruct closure.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythmic, dense prose delights ear and carries information; occasional overwrought metaphors (e.g. “truth just beyond the veil of reality”) mildly dull precision without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lines are fluid and mostly free of loops, though occasional soft filler (“she knew that she had to act before it was too late”) dilutes urgency. Metaphors are mixed but not muddled; “mulberry ache” is fresh. Density is moderate; some sentences could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density; occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial dance,” “radiant hush”) flirts with excess but remains within the lyrical register. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clean and readable, but loops of near-repetition (“as she worked,” “as she sat,” “as the days passed”) dull momentum. Figurative language is pleasant but unfocused; no line-level artifact breaks causality, yet density is low. No scaffolding errors, yet no standout compression or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical without purple overload; information density is high. Minor loop: “cloak of doubt” / “shroud” / “net” metaphors pile up in two adjacent sentences, a small coherence wobble. Otherwise rhythm breathes with pressure, and the final image lands crisply. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich. Occasional soft filler (“gentle lapping,” “serene sycamore hush”) and mild template cadence (“As she…, she…”) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or line-level artifacts in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates well; some sentences verge on purple but momentum survives. One paraphrase loop (“the reaper felt… the reaper’s heart…”) mildly dulls urgency near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. A few near-repetitive constructions (“mage’s thoughts turned…”) and mild scaffold (“the mage knew…”) slightly dull momentum, but no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but cycles of “patterns,” “dance,” and “wonder” create mild synonym loops; no artifact touches the closure, yet density could be tightened by pruning repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional figurative layering (“diamonds scattered across velvet”) is purposeful. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies to match scene tempo. Minor filter verbs appear but do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    Several prolonged phrases that restate the same abstract motion (“numbness … transcend … vivify”) create paraphrase loops costing density. Figurative vehicles—“the very fabric of reality seeming to bend”—teeter on purple yet cease before muddling the key beat. Comma-splice stall appears once or twice without clinical harm. Overall prose is pressure-fed and keeps reader orientation intact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful repetition that teaches pattern. Minor scaffold: “flow of ideas and creativity guiding her” echoes earlier “flow of thoughts.” Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; each paragraph advances mood or ideation. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is musical and mostly propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“cacophony echoing… mournful melody… haunting tapestry”) risk purple overload. No loops or scaffold; final image is clean. Density high; minor register drift in “dormant laughter.”

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but repeated abstract phrasing (“spectral beauty,” “fabric of reality”) and stacked metaphors create minor density drag; no line-level artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional stacked modifiers (“riot of color and light”) flirt with overwriting but stay within pattern. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Final paragraph repeats “thread” and “pattern” to diminishing effect, a minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops; only minor scaffold (“her thoughts turned,” “she would be teaching”) intrudes. Figurative language is coherent, though stacked abstractions (“threshold to the infinite”) risk overwriting. Information density is moderate; some sentences could carry dual duty. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; occasional soft filler (“mystical realm,” “otherworldly silence”) could be sharper. Metaphors are coherent, no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and coherent. Occasional near-repetition (“whispers of the ancients” / “whispers of the canyon”) and stacked modifiers slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure. High information density overall, but minor loops prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold, but leans on abstract intensifiers (“torrent,” “mad jumble,” “grim determination”) instead of concrete image. Metaphors are familiar (“fabric of reality in tatters”). Sentence rhythm is steady; no purposeful acceleration or breath. Information density is moderate; several sentences could do double duty but settle for single function.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with only minor loops (“the carpenter’s thoughts turned…”). Figurative language is occasionally stacked but never muddles causality. A few near-paraphrase pairs (“silent moon… silent carousel carpenter”) could be tightened, yet momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm lilts with cadenced parallelism that occasionally slackens propulsion. Information density good—“she mapped the hyperbolic spaces”—but relies on repeated soft phrase stems (“soft glow,” “soft touch”) that verge on loop. Figurative coherence held; no closure-image obscured by figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but synonym churn around “whispering,” “hush,” and “luminous absence” creates mild loop fatigue. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high yet occasionally ornamental rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)

    Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “tendrils of fog curl” is not repeated. Metaphors are precise: “fabric of reality was thin.” Rhythm accelerates with storm, breathes with encoding. Minor overwriting—“very fabric,” “essence of the ghost”—dulls peak beats slightly but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the diary spoke of…”) appears. Metaphors stay coherent and grounded in ice and light. No loops or purple drift; sentences vary in length to match the elevator’s glide.

    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, though phrases like “light coalescing into a new reality” edge toward abstraction. Rhythm modulates with ascent and dawn. A few stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light”) could be tighter, but no artifact obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but cycles “soft,” “ethereal,” “shimmering” in adjacent lines, creating mild synonym loops. Metaphors (“sea of wonder”) verge on purple yet stay legible. No line-level artifact obscures closure, yet density could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“quantifiable force,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register but stays within lyrical tolerance. Sentence variety supports momentum; no artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but occasional stacked modifiers (“soft, golden light,” “gentle, ethereal energy”) dilute impact. No loops or scaffolds, yet density could be tighter in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“presence as unobtrusive as a whispered secret”). One paraphrase echo (“deep sense of comfort” / “deep sense of peace”) is negligible. Line-level craft supports the quiet accumulative design without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft loops (“sense of peace that lingered…”) are minor. Metaphors stay coherent; no purple drift. Final paragraph leans slightly explanatory, dulling the last image’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lyrical and largely free of loops, but occasional stacked modifiers (“quartz hush,” “luminous vows”) edge toward purple. Density is high; rhythm modulates with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stock phrases (“heart quickened,” “thick with the smell”) slightly dull edge. Clarity and concision hold; no mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; one paraphrase loop (“world around her seemed…”) and a few stacked modifiers slightly dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so 9+ remains possible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic; a few near-repetitions (“act of creating something new… act of creating”) and stacked modifiers slightly dilute propulsion. Metaphors cohere and the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean and propulsive, but paraphrase loops (“As she worked… As she walked…”) and stacked “seemed to” constructions dull immediacy. No figurative muddle at closure, yet the rhythm flattens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, but rhythmic repetition of “glisten,” “symphonies,” and “whispers” dulls impact. Some sentences stack ethereal modifiers without fresh information. Line-level clarity is high; no grammar or tense slips. Compression is adequate, yet occasional filler phrases (“stood as a testament”) slacken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances caretaker action or atmospheric charge. Occasional soft filler—“a testament to,” “a sense of”—slows propulsion but never near closure. Metaphors (flames “strangely organic”) are apt and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is clean and readable but relies on stock phrasing (“vibrant courtyard,” “gentle hum,” “palpable history”). Sentence rhythm is uniform; no strategic variation heightens pressure. Occasional redundancy (“story it held within” right after “aged locket”) flattens density. No figurative muddle, yet no memorable line either.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lean and musical, with purposeful repetition that accretes texture. A few soft loops (“Aria felt a sense of…”) and abstract nouns slightly dilute immediacy, but no line-level artifact obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is restrained and purposeful. Minor scaffold phrases (“the lighter’s task took on…”) appear but do not stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; clarity remains intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows cleanly; occasional soft filler (“the tutor smiled, knowing…”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Density adequate for length; final image could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is fluid but repetitive—multiple sentences restate the seashell’s whispers and Lyra’s longing without new pressure. Mixed metaphors (“shadows danced like ethereal ballerinas,” “beacon guiding her toward a truth”) blur rather than sharpen. Several filter-verb stacks (“she felt,” “she realized”) dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. A few stacked modifiers (“soft, luminous color that was both calming and unsettling”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No line-level artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely loops. Some phrases (“webs of intrigue,” “universe hummed its secret song”) risk repetition, but none stall momentum. Density is high; every sentence advances image or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely loop-free, with rhythmic variety and vivid sensory nouns. Minor scaffold phrases (“the weight of her story,” “fragile beauty”) recur without adding pressure. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked (“broken shell,” “swirling mixture,” “threads that bound”). No line-level artifact obscures closure, but density could be higher for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with minor loops (“hidden patterns” repeated without new pressure). Figurative language is coherent; no mixed metaphors. A few filter verbs dull immediacy but do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, concise, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stock phrases (“shiver run down her spine”) are minor. Sensory specificity outweighs cliché; sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, with pleasing cadence. Occasional stock phrases (“lost in thought,” “winds howling”) and elevated lyricism drift into purple at high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; some sentences could carry double duty. Grammar and clarity are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud musical, but loops of “dusty relics,” “bitter taste,” and “forgotten dreams” create mild redundancy. Metaphors are coherent; no clarity breaks. Density is high yet occasionally padded by abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor loop: “seemed to” used three times in two sentences mid-story; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; sensory detail is selective. Minor loops—“the mapper knew,” “she felt”—recur without pattern payoff. No figurative muddle, but density could be sharpened in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and vivid; occasional scaffold (“memories that had been entangled… began to untangle”) and mild overwriting (“fortified vulnerability”) slightly dull momentum. No loops or artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. A few soft modifiers (“gentle ticking,” “soft whirring”) could be trimmed, but no artifacts obstruct clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer image, motion, and concept without redundancy. Minor loop risk in repeated “acid sea churned” but cadence variation offsets it. No figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; minor loops (“haunting sense of absence” echoed) and a few stock phrases (“shiver run down her spine”) keep it from the top band. No artifacts touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “weighted breath”) skirts but avoids purple overload. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. One mixed metaphor—“map empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart”—barely grazes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive. Occasional near-repetition (“I felt a sense of…”) and stacked prepositional phrases slightly dilute density. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical, dense, and largely loop-free; occasional soft filler (“quiet, passionate subtlety”) but no artifact clusters. Metaphors are coherent; rhythm supports contemplative pacing. High-band craft with minor slack.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but mild paraphrase loops (“the line walker felt a sense of…”) and stacked abstractions (“wisdom,” “peace,” “calm”) dilute density. No line-level artifacts break closure, yet tightening could heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences flow with pleasant rhythm and few artifacts, but information is low-density—repetitions of serenity and lavender sap propulsion. A paraphrase loop about peace and beauty recurs without accumulation of new knowledge or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, with selective sensory detail and purposeful repetition of “hush” and “pattern.” Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” vibe) fits the scholarly POV. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum is steady until the slightly expository final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“mist like a palpable entity”) serve atmosphere without crowding. Information density is high—each sentence advances mood or action. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction is voice-motivated and consistent. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Figurative language is selective; occasional soft phrases (“world gone mad”) are offset by concrete imagery. One scaffold pattern—“Eli’s work… Eli’s journey… Eli’s story”—recurs in closing paragraphs, creating mild redundancy. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, with strong sensory specificity and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope”) flirt with abstraction but do not obscure causality. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum breathes with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentences are clear and grammatically clean; occasional rhythmic variation avoids monotony. Minor scaffold: repeated “Lyra” sentence openings and near-paraphrase (“secrets of the cosmos,” “secrets of the universe”). No figurative muddle or overwriting, yet density is moderate rather than high-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but suffers from light scaffold—repetitive sentence stems (“As she…”) and near-paraphrase loops that dull momentum. No artifact touches the closure beat, so the cap is not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; sensory detail is purposeful, loops are rare. A few soft near-repeats (“soft luminescence,” “gentle light”) slightly dilute momentum but never stall it.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid and image-dense without overwriting; sentences vary in length and texture. Occasional soft phrases (“a slowly unfolding peace”) slightly dilute urgency, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Occasional soft phrases (“sense of calm wash over her”) drift toward cliché but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in final third. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; some soft filler (“as if drawn to the soft glow,” “seemed to attune”) slows propulsion. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates with the song’s crescendo. A few near-paraphrase pairs keep it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, rhythmic compression without loops; figurative language serves atmosphere, not excess; occasional elevated diction fits alchemist POV.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but loops of “soft glow,” “winding tunnels,” and “secrets” dull density. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor scaffold: repeated “as he” openings and near-paraphrase (“he felt… he knew…”) accumulate without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythm and selective detail, but slight over-patterning in “shimmering with a light that was both fragile and resilient” dulls the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance atmosphere or interiority. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle whisper,” “soft scrape”) verge on template but do not cluster. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare and coherent. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction in “rust-hued peace,” but it fits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft loops (“fragments of overheard stories… snippets of conversations”) and elevated diction (“fractured stillness,” “conceptual repricing”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and readable, with occasional elegant phrases (“dusty surfaces gleaming with a newfound light”), yet it leans on stock cadences and near-paraphrase loops (“a sense of wonder, a sense of awe”). No artifacts obscure closure, but density is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Occasional soft repeats (“excruciatingly gentle” twice, “petrichor nostalgia” echoed) slightly dull momentum but never within the closure beat. Metaphors stay coherent; no scaffold loops obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and image-dense, but occasional stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light”) and near-paraphrase loops slightly dilute momentum; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition that builds cadence. Some sentences loop (“the collector felt…”) and could be trimmed. No mixed metaphors or clarity issues; minor scaffold in “the collector felt a sense of…” constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush yet controlled; occasional near-repetition (“shadowed garden… shadows”) is minor. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose often lifts from showering modifiers yet propels, e.g., “quaking reverie… bitterly sweet nostalgia”; isolated mantra loops (“he felt,” “the prince felt”) and stock phrases drain punch, but no artifact stains the culminating stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“kelp-drift peace,” “scars can sing”) edge toward poetic convenience but do not loop or stall momentum. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; sentences advance story or atmosphere without scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“kaleidoscope of images and emotions”) skirts overwriting but remains anchored in POV. No loops, no mixed metaphors; punctuation and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often luminous, but stacked cosmic metaphors create mild density drag. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final cadence lands cleanly; earlier sentences could lose 5–7 words without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with rhythmic variation and strong verbs. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle stream,” “soft whisper”) flirt with cliché but never stall momentum; no loops or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is vivid and read-aloud smooth; occasional looping near-synonyms (“stillness give way to motion…continue to emerge”) creates mild scaffold. No mixed metaphors or clarity failures. Density holds; no artifacts threaten closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is fluid and sensory-rich, but repetitive sentence stems (“the gardener… the gardener…”) and mild paraphrase loops dull momentum. No artifacts obstruct closure, yet rhythm could be tighter under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional figurative layering (“kaleidoscope of possibility”) flirts with excess but stays purposeful. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is textured and propulsive, but occasional ornamental layering (“ethereal light,” “otherworldly energy”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Rhythm varies naturally. Metaphors stay coherent; no register drift. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, with occasional poetic elevation (“weaves truth carefully”) that fits the gallery hush. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent. A few near-repetitive phrases (“somber tones,” “somber marvel”) slightly dull momentum. Final image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. A few near-paraphrase loops (“competing narratives that swirled in his head like a maelstrom” echoed later) and mild scaffold (“he was driven… he was driven”) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with purposeful variation in sentence length. Minor paraphrase loops (“sense of…”) and soft filter verbs slightly dull immediacy; no artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Craft is lyrical and readable, but metaphor clusters (“a symphony of tastes and textures”) verge on overwritten during climax, and phrases like “key to her craft” edge cliché. Minor rhythm sways keep it slightly short of effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops or scaffold. Occasional filler (“mesmerized by the toll keeper’s candid nature”) and stock phrases (“stars began to twinkle”) slightly dull the final image. No figurative muddle, good paragraph variety.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“inexplicable connection,” “forever changed”) dilute precision. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet a few elevated abstractions keep it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid but leans on abstract summary (“cascade of revelations”) and repetitive phrasing (“the statue realized… the statue began… the statue’s thoughts”). No loops in closure, yet figurative language occasionally drifts toward the decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Few slips; occasional near-loop ("never-ending" x3), but each reiteration gains new semantic weight. Metaphors are coherent across physics and philosophy. Micro-edits only for economy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition. Occasional soft loops (“the painter’s eyes… the painter’s fingers…”) mildly dull momentum. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; each paragraph advances image or intention. Minor scaffold in the final paragraph (“the painter knew… the painter smiled”) prevents 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, with rhythmic variation. Minor scaffold appears—“the weight of their discovery settling upon them like a mantle” is near-cliché—but does not stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clean grammar but repetitive phrasing (“the clock maker’s heart pounded,” “the clock maker knew”) and filler scaffolding (“As he…”) slow momentum. Metaphors are stock (“wind whipped his hair into a frenzy”).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is fluid but padded—repetitive “whispering advisor” tags and echoing “lingering luminance” phrases slow momentum. No line-level artifacts in the closing beat, yet density is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid yet occasionally overwritten—“restless euphony,” “tiny, shining jewel suspended”—creating minor density drag. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies. Metaphors cohere within dream-logic; clarity never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, readable, with selective sensory detail. Minor loops (“she felt the weight… she felt the weight”) and stock phrases (“sent a chill down her spine”) dull intensity. No mixed metaphors. Density adequate—sentences advance scene or mood. Final third avoids artifacts. Lacks the compression and propulsion demanded at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is fluid and mostly free of loops, but metaphors like “morbid perfume” and “ghostly figure” feel slightly stock. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid; occasional soft filler (“the surveyor’s heart burned with a hushed blaze”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors. Strong sentence variety and tactile specificity. One paraphrase loop (“stories of the past… stories yet to be told”) keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and sensory, but occasional elevated diction (“gravitas,” “indelible”) edges toward purple. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance knowledge or mood. Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional soft-focus phrases (“poignant reflection”) edge toward overwriting but do not stall momentum. Strong cadence and sensory specificity keep the beat alive.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong sensory specificity. Occasional soft scaffolding (“she felt the weight… she began to make her way”) slightly dilutes propulsion. Mixed metaphors are avoided; only minor loops (“secrets that lay hidden… waiting to be uncovered”) appear. Overall craft is polished, but not yet flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“recycle their mistakes into wisdom”) edges toward abstraction but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluid, occasionally repetitive (“sense of calm wash over him… sense of peace settle over him”). No major loops, but figurative language is safe (“flickering flame of faith”). Clarity is high; density moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; sensory detail is selective. A few stock phrases—“weight of her past bearing down,” “kindle empathy where none remained”—dull impact. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, but no sentence-level propulsion heightens the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with strong sensory specificity. Minor loop: “fragrance…fragrance” repetition and stacked abstract nouns (“cosmic harmony,” “cosmic intimacy”) slightly dilute density. No line-level artifacts impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely repeats without payoff. Minor scaffold: “the cartomancer’s thoughts turned…” is a mild filter, but momentum holds. Rhythm breathes with beats; no loops or simultaneity errors. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    Melodic cadence veers into template phrases (“deep sense of resolve” / “deep sense of wonder”) and mild paraphrase loops across paragraphs, preventing the punch-through clarity demanded at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, but repeated “whispering hush” and “slow dance” phrases create mild template cadence; metaphors stay coherent, though density spikes without proportional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean but leans on familiar fantasy cadences (“luminous fort,” “ethereal light”). Some paraphrase loops (“new era of freedom and creativity” appears twice). No syntactic muddle, yet little rhythmic urgency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sacred patterns that governed the cosmos”) risks register drift but remains within the herder’s mythic register. No loops or scaffold detected.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, sentences doing double duty. Minor loops (“storm…storm”) and near-synonym churn (“turbulence…turmoil”) appear but never obscure causality or dull the closure image. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor loops (“As he waited… As he waited…”) and one stock phrase (“etched in his mind”) dull momentum slightly. No grammatical slips or clarity issues. The final paragraph leans toward summary, but it does not obscure the closure image. Overall propulsion is steady, with no artifacts in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and mostly loop-free, but stacked metaphors (“vortex of sound,” “tide of music”) create momentary density without added pressure. A few near-paraphrase lines (“the pianist knew…”) could be trimmed. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, though occasional soft filler (“gentle hum of insects,” “vibrant landscape in bloom”) pads rather than propels. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph drifts into slightly elevated summary, dulling the last beat’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich; no loops or scaffold. Occasional soft modifiers (“gently,” “slowly”) could be pruned, but they fit the placid cadence. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality through concrete action (release into waves).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops plague closure: "accumulated dust patterns" repeats verbatim in paras 5 and 15. Final-third cadence run ("Maria's research would continue... Maria found peace...") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty, dulling closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence dominates ("As she [verb], she felt...") with synonym churn ("disorientation"/"fragility and beauty"). Overwritten metaphors ("world seemed to hold its breath") blur in high-pressure beats; final-third "felt a sense of peace" filter-verb stack dulls closure immediacy despite otherwise clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose flows with rhythmic control yet over-relies on stock phrases ("frayed nerves," "wordless language"); minor scaffold in heat-map description ("danced across its screen, a mesmerizing display") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("descended," "navigated," "resembled") but "inexplicable pull" introduces therapy-speak in a pivotal beat; recurring "stillness" motif risks redundancy though redeemed by final image specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose flows with rhythmic control yet minor synonym loops dilute impact: "soft chime"/"gentle hum"/"soft rustle" risk textural redundancy. No closure-tainting artifacts, but "drifted off to sleep" finale lacks the textural specificity demanded at elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Template cadence ("seemed to," "felt a") in paragraph 1 creates synonym churn ("ethereal light," "foggy lucidity," "mystical ambiance"). Filter-verb stacks ("her mind wandered," "fingers went," "felt a surge") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat. Final image ("petals swaying like ethereal dancers") avoids muddle, but artifacts in first third disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loop in climax: "disorienting, yet exhilarating... exhilarating and terrifying" with synonym churn. Template cadence runs (5+ "As they..." constructions) in final third trigger -1.1 penalty. Overwritten metaphors ("dissolving into quaking reverie... dreamscape... hidden harmony") blur clarity. Strength: opening sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence loops ("As they...", "With...") repeat 7×. "Staggering grace" appears twice as unearned label. Paraphrase loop: "row upon row of seeds... each one a testament" dilutes momentum in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density with evocative phrasing ("joyful cacophony"), but "battered marvel" paraphrase loop in final third dulls closure impact—artifact disallows 9+ per global rules.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops dominate ("vanished into the night" x2, "fleeting golden sunset" verbatim repeat). "Soft, ethereal light" cliché muddles imagery. Filter-verb stack ("felt the atmosphere shift... skin tingled") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Repetitive stems ("Elian's thoughts turned...") and filter-verb stacks ("Elian knew... felt... smiled") dull immediacy. "Morbid perfume... damp shroud" mixes metaphors. Final paragraph's lyrical cadence compensates but can't offset scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("I felt... I was... I was...") and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines: "I felt drawn... I felt a sense of purpose... I felt a shiver"). Template cadence in resolution ("I was ready... I was ready..."). Final paragraph’s "force to be reckoned with" is generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "eyes shone with otherworldly intensity" repeats verbatim (minor scaffold). Figurative language ("dripped like honey") avoids muddle yet slightly over-embellishes high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cripple closure: "remarkably composed" verbatim 4x; "frozen courtyard at twilight" repeated 3x. Filter-verb stacks ("Zeta had observed," "Zeta began to understand") in high-pressure beats. Final paragraph’s stock metaphors ("beacon of tranquility") obscure conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe overwriting: "ambiguously clear glass" (redundant), "whispers of the city" (cliché), and stacked metaphors ("mistrust melting... replaced by clarity"). Template cadence in 7/10 high-pressure beats ("She..."; "The lens...") dulls immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion but minor overwriting in "bittersweet aroma that the dresser found comforting" slightly dulls immediacy; no loops or scaffold, though "withered vine dresser" repetition approaches template cadence in final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion until final third where "subdued awakenings" and verbatim "hush of beating wings" repetition dull closure's immediacy with therapy-speak and scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Scaffold loops dilute momentum ("Rachel felt... Rachel saw... Rachel pondered" in quick succession); "haunting and sublime" emotional labeling in the climax feels abstract. Strong specificity in early beats (water-damaged program images) elevates density.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("charcoal drawing" vanishing), but abstract phrases like "weight of swallowed truth" recur without concrete embodiment in high-pressure beats, creating subtle scaffold loops that dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence plagues key beats: "Their eyes adjusted... Their gaze fell... They wondered" (three identical stems). "Morbid perfume" creates mixed metaphor, muddling sensory clarity in high-pressure tunnel scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "silence enveloping like a shroud" followed by "silence deepened" creates paraphrase loop. Strong verbs ("burrow," "unravel") but redundant "crumbling peace" repetitions dull closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence ("As she played...", "As the shadows deepened...") and stock metaphors ("hush of dreaming roots") proliferate; filter-verb stacks in the closure beat ("Eli's face was alight") dull immediacy, disqualifying 9+ per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Minor scaffold loops ("As she..."/"With...") dilute momentum in mid-beats; "bronze quiet" repetition crosses into thematic echo by closure, slightly dulling the final image’s charge despite otherwise clean, textured prose.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pervasive figurative loops ("whispers of the night," "tapestry of open secrets") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; synonym churn on "orchestrate/direct/guide" triggers scaffold penalty in critical closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.9)
    Peak-beat overwriting: "complex web of sound both fragile and powerful" and "muffled clarity" create figurative muddle. Paraphrase loops ("unravel the stillness" x3) and template cadence ("The priest's eyes...") dull closure momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.3)
    Template cadence ("As the [time]..., the writer's [action]...") repeats 5× with paraphrase loops in closure beat. Mixed metaphor ("air heavy with upturned hush") and filter-verb stack ("knew that they had to seize...") dull immediacy. Accumulation cap -1.5 for three distinct artifacts including closure-beat muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic control and textural specificity ("puddles below," "runes that shift and writhe") propel momentum, but minor synonym churn appears ("ethereal glow," "faint eerie glow," "lunar light"). No artifacts touch closure, though adjacent descriptions occasionally restate atmospheric shifts without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("gentle rustle of turning seasons" repeated verbatim); "enthrall" overuse (3x) triggers −0.2 scaffold penalty, but propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs like "coaxing", "weaving".

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Template cadence runs ("she felt... she was left... she knew") in paragraph 7 and filter-verb clusters in closure beat trigger -0.5 cap. Mixed metaphor ("tranquility wrapped like a shroud") muddles final image’s emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density in sensory prose, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("memories that threatened to overwhelm her"/"memories that had shaped her") dull closure beat. "Crystal shadows" repetition lacks pattern-teaching; near-synonym churn ("familiar sting of tears"/"tears she had carried") edges toward scaffold in high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose avoids scaffold loops but shows template cadence ("As she strolled... As she worked... As the night wore on") in mid-section. Strong verbs ("undulating," "coaxing") offset slight overwriting in "tactile sensation both rough and smooth," with closure image ("faded into background") clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops ("chronic hush" x4, "beauty in the unfinished" x2) and generic abstractions ("vibrant green amidst desolation") dilute density. Final-third scaffold ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") obscures closure’s cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("luminescent stones dimming... flickered back to life") dulls closure beat. Otherwise high density: "static electricity dance of molecules" compresses science/feeling. Final line slightly overwritten but no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("gentle breeze carried whispers... mingling with musty scent") and therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance") cause -0.3 momentum drag. Propulsion strong in discovery beat, yet filter verbs ("Lena's eyes... scanned") dull immediacy where concrete action would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with minor redundancies: "glimmering obsidian arbor" phrasing near-echoes (synonym churn risk) and final paragraph’s "breathtaking/awe" slightly overwrites the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Template cadence in final third ("As she worked... With each moment... As she opened") dulls immediacy. Filter-verb stack ("Lyra felt... She smiled...") in closure beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty, disallowing 9+ globally per text-artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density marred by scaffold loops ("air seemed to vibrate... conjurer felt weight"); final "realm of possibility" line risks thematic echo, dulling closure's conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong opening lines anchor voice, but paraphrase loops ("soft clinking... soothing melody"; "whispered rumor... myth") and stock lyricism ("sapphire hush" x2) reduce density. Final image suffers from "beacon in the sapphire hush" register drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence run ("She had always... She spent... However...") in paragraph 3 triggers -0.5; paraphrase loops ("serene after rain"/"soft, emerald hue"/"sanctuary") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold in reflective blocks ("searching for inspiration... stumbled upon") slows momentum; strong verbs offset generic phrases like "weight of the convergence," though final image avoids closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold, though "bright darkness" risks mixed metaphor without payoff. Final line ("waiting to be magnified and shared") leans cliché but avoids thematic echo penalties here. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and no paraphrase loops dull momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Paraphrase loops ("compile fragments," "disparate elements") and template cadence ("She felt... She purchased...") dull momentum; closure beat's "testament to remembrance" is therapy-speak label.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence loops ("Emilia felt... Emilia walked...") and paraphrase redundancies ("mystery and uncertainty... full of possibility") dull momentum. Overwriting ("whispering secrets to those who dared listen") muddles peak beats, but no artifacts directly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose flows lyrically but overwrites key beats: "unexpected surge of courageously kind determination" uses label-speak where embodied detail (shaking hands, steadying breath) would heighten pressure. Template cadence ("As she..., she felt...") recurs in transcription scenes, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    Template cadence ("Kael [verb], and [conjunction] Kael [verb]") and filter-verb stacks ("allowed the immortal to perceive") dull immediacy in climax. Final-third artifacts (-0.5 penalty) obscure closure’s conceptual cost with redundant description.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Template cadence in final beats ("she felt... she knew... she was ready") dulls closure momentum. Figurative muddle ("deathly vitality") is intentional but risks opacity; scaffold loops in ink pot handling reduce density despite strong opening prose.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "pencil moved with precision... pencil danced... pencil slowed" (lines 9, 13, 15). Filter-verb stack in "she was drawn to this time" dulls immediacy where momentum should accelerate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Template cadence cripples momentum: three consecutive "Their [noun] [verb]" openings ("eyes scanned... gaze lingered... mind wandered"). Paraphrase loop in "reconstruct erased histories... rediscover texture of memories" bloats key beats without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Final paragraph’s template cadence ("She knew... She felt... She knew...") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. Synonym loops ("hair into a frenzy" x2) and "gloomy cheerfulness" repetition dull immediacy, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Competent prose with minor scaffold ("navigated the complex web") and abstract phrasing ("spirit that could not be bought"). No closure-dulling loops, but "living, breathing entity" risks purple prose in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence in opening ("As the moon... As she raised... As the first light") creates rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops ("stillness... palpable, a dawning hush") and final-third repetition of "dawnlit" disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Paraphrase loops ("calm demeanor was magnetic... creating serenity" then "mist began to clear") and template cadence ("As [X], Emilia [Y]") in closure beat. Final image's weak nominalizations ("a demonstration of Emilia's skill") obscure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Snow crunched beneath her feet" paraphrase loop (3x identical phrasing) triggers -0.4; "worrying tranquility" label in high-pressure beat adds -0.3. Final image lacks textural specificity for peak momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with dual-purpose lines ("cobblestones worn smooth... seemed to stir"), but minor scaffold in repetitive "infinitely patient" phrasing. No loops in closure beat preserves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "gathered hush" restated verbatim, "lonesome splendor" repeated with identical phrasing. Filter-verb stacks ("Kael felt," "Kael knew") cluster during climax, dulling propulsion despite otherwise vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "lattice seemed to sustain impossibilities" muddles physical logic. Template cadence ("He pushed... Inside... As he walked...") and synonym churn ("thread the labyrinth with his own story" repeated 3x). Final-third filter-verb stack disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting ("resonant frequency she had unwittingly unlocked") and paraphrase loops ("ghostly presence"/"enduring presence") slightly dull momentum, though final line's "mournful elation" achieves crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Overwriting dilutes propulsion: "ethereal light," "orchid solace," and "ruin to reverence" repeat as synonym loops. Final third’s "beacon of hope" phrasing risks sentimentality. Strong opening lines anchor voice, but scaffold phrases like "a testament to" dull closure’s charge despite otherwise controlled rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical but "cautious enchantment" repeats as scaffold, dulling closure. Filter verbs ("Maya felt") accumulate in high-pressure beats without payoff. Final line resonant but overwriting slightly obscures cost legibility. No template cadence, but density falters in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Template cadence cripples momentum: "Cipher [verb], Cipher [verb]..." repeats 7x in high-pressure beats. "Futuristic nostalgia" label violates POV lexicon; no figurative muddle but scaffold loops dilute closure’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops ("shimmer and glow"/"shimmering threads") and template cadence ("as if guided... as if it too...") obscure causality; overwriting in peak beats ("vibrate with otherworldly energy") muddles closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity ("dappled shadows on the water"), but paraphrase loop ("messages began to appear... Aria's eyes scanned the messages") and abstract label-speak ("weight of unspoken apologies") trigger -0.6 artifact penalty in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density in coral/cast descriptions. Minor register drift in "lotus-hearted ache" (academic diction) risks overwriting in high-pressure beat, but rhythm variations sustain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paraphrase loop in "veil between reality and dreams" repetition (-0.4) and template cadence ("as she...") in final paragraph. High density otherwise, but "morbid perfume" cliché dulls closure image despite strong textural specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence loops: "As [time], Lyra [verb]" repeats 3x with identical structure. Therapy-speak ("converging chaos of thoughts") and mixed metaphor ("tapestry of meaning") dilute momentum. Final paragraph overwrites with abstract summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure-dulling artifacts: therapy-speak label ("photosynthesize pain") and synonym churn in final paragraph. Template cadence ("as she...", "the poet...") in high-pressure beats disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence ("As she worked... As she continued...") dulls immediacy in key beats. Filter-verb stack ("eyes lingered," "expression," "thoughts turned") in paragraph 3 obscures cause/effect. Final third’s "ethereal light, a testament" uses corporate diction during closure, triggering -0.7 artifact penalty. Overwriting in high-pressure moments reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "reverence and fervor" followed by "carefully reckless intensity," and "symphonies of truth" repeated 4x with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence ("As she worked...") in the climax dulls immediacy, violating the zero-loops 9+ standard despite otherwise vivid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("stones expanding and contracting" rephrased 3x); filter-verb stacks ("Kaelin felt...") in high-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Final thematic echo compounds line-level opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with vivid imagery, but "blooming withering" and dual "musty scent" repetitions slightly dilute momentum; final line ("dust motes dance") crystallizes closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwritten sensory density ("shattered light danced... otherworldly glow") in opening beats creates paraphrase loops; "fractured hush" repetition dulls momentum without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops: "luminous respite" (3x), "shadowseam wonder" (4x). Template cadence ("As [time]...") dominates final third. Filter-verb stacks ("began to sense," "started to shift") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lyrical propulsion, but minor scaffold appears in reflection beats ("thoughts turned to the nature of memory") where concrete action could replace abstract musing without losing thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Paraphrase loop in final third: "soothing melody" (para 1) vs. "soothing background noise" (para 11). Filter-verb stack ("Elian felt... knew... felt") dulls immediacy in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    Overwriting undermines propulsion: scaffold loops ("serene and isolated haven" echoed as "sacred space"), filter-verb stacks ("Aria felt... knew... began"), and mixed metaphor ("stars faded but light remained"). Final paragraph's redundant awe ("wonder and awe... peace... wonder") dulls closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Two paraphrase loops ("sense of peace settle over her" verbatim repeat) and template cadence in climax ("She felt... She knew... She felt...") trigger -0.6 deduction. Final third artifacts ("heart full of clear complexity") prevent 9+ eligibility. Strong opening rhythm degrades into abstract lyricism during key realization beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("slow dance of celestial bodies" verbatim reuse) and filter-verb stacks ("Kael felt... Kael realized") dull momentum; final-third artifacts like "fragile beauty" trigger disallowance of 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose loops dilute momentum: "arranging objects into intricate patterns was meditative" then "decorations taking on life." Critical flaw: "serene upheaval" in vision beat is stock metaphor, dulling closure’s emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong opening rhythm devolves into scaffold loops: "rewound... mind racing" followed by "passage seemed darker" paraphrases emotional state. Closure beat overwrites with redundant metaphors ("testament," "journey full circle"), triggering Q7’s density penalty and dulling the final image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory prose marred by climax artifacts: "colors dancing" → "colors swirling" synonym loop and "borrowed heartbeat" repetition dull momentum. Stacked modifiers in "dusky harmony that seemed to pulse" risk muddle; final beat lacks zero-loop rigor for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops ("ritual significance" ×3, "price of redemption" ×3) and synonym churn in climax ("measure of peace, a sense of redemption"). Template cadence in final paragraph dulls closure image; overwriting with stacked modifiers ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Redundant loops dilute impact: "echo" appears four times in the final paragraph, and "cracked expanse" repeats without deepening; overwriting in high-pressure moments ("deafening crash that shook foundations") muddles the closure beat's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Final paragraph contains paraphrase loop: "reminder of the power... beauty of being true to oneself" followed by "no longer a call to conformity." This scaffold dulls closure impact per Q7's loop screen. "Alarming serenity" feels like forced lyricism rather than character-particular observation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    Severe line-level artifacts: template cadence ("began to soothe," "began to craft"), synonym churn ("serene calm"/"uncommonly serene"), and filter-verb stacks in final paragraph dull closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Filter-verb stack in closure beat ("felt a sense of peace... felt connection") dulls immediacy. Template cadence ("fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful") repeats in high-pressure moment. Final paragraph paraphrase loop obscures earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    No scaffold loops or syntax monotony, but "snowmelt ardor" creates figurative muddle in closure beat—snowmelt implies thawing while ardor denotes passion, diluting the final image's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    No closure-impairing artifacts; "dance of understood events" to "dance in precisely playful manner" triggers paraphrase loop (−0.2). Figurative density balanced but "ethereal grit" lacks concrete embodiment in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    "Dusky harmony" repetition creates paraphrase loops (3x in final 100 words); "celestial rhythms" cadence runs dull immediacy; lyrical density obscures causality in covenant "sealing" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("distant memory, silenced"; "reappear when needed") and template cadence ("her fingers tracing... she pondered...") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy in high-pressure healing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in opening beats ("As twilight approached... Upon this shimmer... As she held") triggers paraphrase-loop penalty; final image clarity prevents deeper deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zero loops with high density, but "endearingly feisty" and "symbolic gesture" constitute label-speak in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.4 artifact penalty. Final line's "flourished, nurtured" slightly overwrites.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    Filter-verb stacks ("began to feel", "experienced a realization") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final-third genericism ("teeming with life and possibility") triggers -0.3 artifact penalty without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    Closure beat crippled by figurative muddle: "unheard symphony" repeated 3x with escalating vagueness. "Silence almost palpable" cliché and paraphrase loops ("new path... new purpose... new world") dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    Multiple artifacts dull closure: "memories alter" creates logical muddle, while "peace wash over her" uses passive voice during peak revelation. Template cadence ("As she [verb], the [noun] [verb]") repeats in high-pressure beats, and therapy-speak ("recapture the essence") reduces density. Final image lacks textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    Heavy figurative language muddles climax ("air vibrated with otherworldly energy"). Paraphrase loops: "confusion into clarity" recurs 3x with minor variations. Template cadence in closure beat: four consecutive "Emilia felt..." sentences. Filter-verb stack in final image disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Thistle-blown" repetition creates paraphrase loop; "shard of hush" appears verbatim three times. No closure-dulling artifacts, but synonym churn limits propulsion in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwriting in "thousand tiny sparks" dilutes storm tension; filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster in high-pressure beats. Final image ("stars twinkling like diamonds") avoids cliché with precise textural charge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Warmly observant" repetition creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats; minor scaffold in contemplative passages. No closure-dulling artifacts but cadence lacks peak-beat compression.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Intangibly tangible" creates mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat (climax description), dulling closure image per Q7 artifact rules despite otherwise precise prose.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.6)
    Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure moments ("swirling and eddied... swirling in hypnotic dance"); elevated diction like "catalyze" violates POV lexicon during transit beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence ("Aria's gaze fell... she reached... she knew") in critical beats. Filter-verb stack ("she felt the weight settling") in closure scene prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Severe overwriting in closure beat: "doorknocker ring seemed to glow with a soft, ethereal light" stacks redundant modifiers. Template cadence ("The keeper's touch was gentle... The keeper's footsteps echoed...") dulls immediacy in high-pressure scenes, triggering -1.7 penalty for artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops in climax: "pressure began to build... pressure reached its peak." Mixed metaphor—"weight of diamonds" (literal) clashes with "weight of the journey" (conceptual). Overwriting in high-pressure beat dilutes momentum with redundant intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "standing waves" metaphor strains coherence ("air vibrate with standing waves" then "standing waves revealed hidden patterns"). Template cadence ("As the...") in climax dilutes momentum despite otherwise vivid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure beat suffers from paraphrase loops ("murmured allegiance still echoed"/"connection to Lysander") and therapy-speak ("shivering bliss"). Final "golden light" lacks textural specificity, dulling the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Multiple scaffold loops ("the more... the more...") and filter verbs ("Emilia's eyes wandered") dull key beats. Final paragraph's thesaurus churn ("unassuming thing that unfolded like a flower") obscures closure image. Strong opening rhythm degrades.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythm and specificity ("luminescent orbs," "damp earth") but scaffold weakens momentum: "carefully resourceful" tells rather than shows, and "barren landscape devoid of memory" overwrites concrete stakes with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    Overwriting in climax: "tendrils of fog curling around prism structures like ethereal fingers" mixes metaphors (tendrils vs. fingers). Repetitive "mist" references in final paragraph create synonym churn, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("complex code"/"decoding the leaves") and closure-beat overwriting ("heart full of wonder... deeper understanding") reduce density. Final paragraph's thematic summary dulls cost legibility per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paraphrase loop ("scent of damp earth") in high-pressure beats dulls closure image; strong verbs ("swirled," "whirred") countered by redundant "damp earth and [possibility/mold]" repetitions that violate concision standards for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density and lyrical flow marred by paraphrase loops ("the foundry became... alchemist's art was reborn") and repetitive "luminous regret" cadence in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure beat drowns in figurative muddle: "luminous ache" and "trail of peace" create mixed metaphors. Template cadence ("The collector...") and paraphrase loops ("sense of satisfaction, a sense of purpose") sap propulsion in critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops ("memories came flooding back... recalled the pain") and template cadence ("She remembered... recalled...") in trauma beat. Filter-verb cluster in climax ("Elara felt... knew... continued") triggers -0.5 closure-beat penalty, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    High textural specificity falters in peak beats: "boundless expanse of possibility" and "heart afire" are generic abstractions; filter-verb stacks ("Lena felt... Lena knew") weaken propulsion during closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("skeletal fingers," "faint trail"), but adjacent template cadences ("Ezra's eyes scan... Ezra's gaze drifts...") trigger mild scaffold penalty in mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Synonym churn plagues high-pressure beats: "patterns shifting and reforming into a visual representation of the rustling awakenings" followed by "air was filled with soft crunch of frost and whispering of pages." Template cadence ("the operator knew...") dulls immediacy in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with strategic telling, but adjacent synonym loops ("reimagine, recreate, rediscover") and template cadence ("as she...") in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4 artifact penalty in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Repetitive scaffolding: "mend what wasn't torn" and "reclaim light stolen by midnight" recur verbatim. Template cadence in repair sequence ("fingers moving... deliberate slowness") dulls immediacy despite strong atmospheric lines.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Synonym churn ("intricate engravings and delicate needle") and scaffold loops in climax ("felt herself becoming one with..."). Filter-verb stacks in final third trigger -0.5 penalty disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Repetitive scaffolding ("perpetually learning" x2, "reimagine" variants) and synonym churn ("intricate, ephemeral creations"/"rich tapestry of meaning") dull momentum. Final paragraph's moralizing summary obscures closure image, triggering Text-Artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Beautiful cadence falters with paraphrase loops ("umbral tenderness" x3) and therapy-speak labels; "hush was not just absence of sound" exemplifies overwrought abstraction in peak transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Paraphrase loops ("secrets waiting to be unlocked"/"secrets it held") and template cadence ("As she...") in opening. Overwriting in final paragraph ("vast and mysterious, full of hidden truths") dilutes momentum but avoids closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor scaffold in "mind consumed by the task" followed by "goal was not... but to conceive" creates slight redundancy. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "fierce intensity/fierce determination" repetition edges toward lexical illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("emotional patterns continued to pulse, a gentle reminder") with propulsion. Overwriting risk in "velvet disquiet" recurrence, but payoff in closure image prevents penalty. Final line resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwritten density in high-pressure beats ("kaleidoscope of images," "tug... stirring within") creates mixed metaphors. Template cadence ("she felt...") dulls immediacy; "decreasing entropy" in final third disallows 9+ globally. Strong opening rhythm degrades into abstract reflection during climax, sacrificing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence ("Ember lived... took... would pause") and synonym churn ("solstice hush"/"expectant hush") in final third incur -0.7 artifact penalty. Final line resonates despite loops.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence: 7 consecutive "As..." openings in paragraphs 3-5 trigger -0.6 penalty. Paraphrase loops ("flourishing stillness" x4) and therapy-speak ("strength in vulnerability") cluster in reflection beats, dulling closure. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense of connection") exceed peak-beat tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythm ("sun dipped below horizon... warm golden light") but paraphrase loops ("gaze lingered"/"gaze fell"/"gaze never wavered") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy during the box-opening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence runs ("As they worked... As days turned...") dull immediacy in critical beats. Near-duplicate phrasing like "remnants of a world" and "remnants of a bygone era" trigger paraphrase-loop penalties in closure vicinity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.3)
    Verbatim repetition of "soothing melody" and paraphrase loops ("gentle lapping... rhythm of her heart") in closure beat trigger -0.7 penalty. Elevated diction ("shrill twang piercing air") clashes with meditative voice during pivotal kite snap, muddling pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Scaffold loops: "gently systematic approach" repeated verbatim. Synonym churn in final paragraph ("flourish"/"thrive"/"vibrant"). No figurative muddle, but momentum drag in reflection blocks impedes 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with lyrical propulsion, but minor scaffold ("as if infused with inner radiance"/"as if attuning itself") and "pulsing with inner light" cliché in closure beat prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence plagues pivotal moments: "With... With... As he worked..." loops in para 8-9. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to absorb," "felt the harmony") obscure embodied action during fertilization—a high-pressure beat requiring visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong textural specificity ("creosote and ash") but "wild hush" repeats without modulation. Minor scaffold: "Lyra felt an surge" and "deep sense of connection" use abstract phrasing. No critical loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in paragraph 3 ("Aria felt... Aria's thoughts... Aria began") triggers -0.4; "echoed silence" repetition creates minor loop. Final image achieves high density but "gilded compass rose applique" is clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    Paraphrase loops ("gazing out," "ventured deeper") and template cadence ("With a deep breath...") sap momentum; final-third purple prose ("crystals seemed to sing") dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains rhythmic control with purposeful variation ("soft creaking," "deliberate pattern"), but abstract phrases like "weight of unspoken words" dilute momentum. Zero scaffold loops; final line’s "luminous absence" recharges motif with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("swirling mists," "electric anticipation") and repetitive stems ("The air was...") trigger −0.7 penalty. Filter-verb clusters dull immediacy during magic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting in peak beats: "woven hush that wrapped... like a shroud" + "air heavy with anticipation" creates paraphrase loop (-0.3). Mixed metaphor ("threads reveal message") and therapy-speak ("deep-seated need") dull closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with zero loops; "refract a single truth into many" slightly muddles refraction metaphor but avoids figurative muddle in closure. Final thematic line risks overwriting yet propels momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion (e.g., "fingers moving with precision born of desperation" compresses motive/action); no figurative muddle in peak beats like the gasp-for-air climax.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.3)
    Template cadence ("As she worked...") and mixed metaphors ("mind ablaze" after "sky ablaze") in peak beats. Scaffold loops reduce momentum; "danced across canvas" repetition weakens density.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loops plague key beats: "calm wash over him" followed by "feeling the calm," "fruits of his labor" echoed in "intoxicating aroma." Filter-verb stacks ("feeling the purifying power... feeling himself attuned") dull climax momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion with concrete specificity ("worn smooth by time"). Minor paraphrase loop on "raw solace" (appears twice) and slightly generic "possibility and promise" in final line prevent 9.0. Zero scaffold in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong opening rhythm dissolves into paraphrase loops during textbook discovery ("battered and bruised," "fractured state," "fractured grace"). Filter-verb stacks ("began to piece," "began to uncover") dull immediacy in high-pressure relic investigation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold loops ("Kael watched... Kael noticed") create momentum drag in observation beats. "Borrowed memories" concept explained rather than dramatized in one reflective block, bordering on telling. Strong verbs ("swirled," "snapped," "clutched") anchor specificity, but "witnessed isolation" repetition in final third risks thematic echo without sufficient reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Minor scaffold in repetitive "glimmer" imagery and stock phrases ("tears of joy and sadness"); no critical loops, but overwriting in cavern description slows momentum without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    "Sense of trepidation... sense of purpose... sense of lacy menace" demonstrates synonym churn (-0.3). Final paragraph's "swallowed whole by shadows" creates figurative muddle. Strong verbs ("writhe," "pulsing") offset generic labels, but scaffold phrases dilute momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting with stacked modifiers ("warm orange light danced") and paraphrase loops ("sense of wonder... beyond mere scientific curiosity"). Template cadence in repetitive sentence stems dulls momentum. Final paragraph filter-verb stacks prevent 7.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Filter-verb clusters ("I felt," "I saw," "I knew") in climax paragraph dull immediacy. "Serpentine curve of words" and "kaleidoscope of memories" verge on overwritten metaphor strings, slightly muddling closure’s emotional charge despite lyrical control.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose exhibits controlled rhythm and textural specificity ("soft, diffused light"), but "trembling calm" repetition creates subtle loops. Strategic abstraction in reflective blocks avoids overwriting yet slightly dilutes momentum in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence ("As [X], [Y]") clusters in climax; "saturated hush" repeated verbatim dulls closure. Filter-verb stacks ("Kaito felt," "Kaito recalled") in paragraph 3 impair immediacy without harming causality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density falters in orchard description ("hush before trees were cut down hung in the air") with passive construction. Zero loops but slight overwriting in "ethereal beauty that lay just beneath the surface" dulls final propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Synonym churn ("timeless bounds"/"timeless and fleeting," "distortions cleared"/"distortions that had clouded reality") and template cadence ("As she [verb], [effect]") in climax create momentum drag; weak nominalizations ("a testament to") obscure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold, with high density ("fjord quiet" replacing generic serenity), but "eminently peculiar" feels forced. Final paragraph’s syntactic monotony ("as... as...") slightly dulls closure’s propulsion without muddling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.3)
    Filter-verb stacks cluster in climax: "began to observe," "began to move," "felt a sense of stillness." Template cadence in final paragraph ("As... Lena felt... Lena knew...") dulls closure; Q7’s -0.5 applies for artifacts in final third, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym loops ("glow," "shine," "glinting" around the lantern) and one paraphrase ("calm her"/"soothing melody") mar density. No closure-impacting artifacts; lyrical compression serves the Accumulative lens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Hum of streetlamps" scaffold (4 repeats) and synonym churn ("haunting, yet beautiful" → "beautiful and melancholic") dull momentum. Final paragraph’s template cadence ("And as... And in this moment...") triggers -0.4 loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Loops abound: "haunted euphoria" (4x), "weight of small moments" (3x). Final paragraph’s "testament to enduring power" uses abstract thematic echo, dulling closure. Density muddle in peak beats lowers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose soars in rhythm and specificity ("ivy tendrils like skeletal fingers"), but "cure for loneliness" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty. Minor scaffold in reflection beats ("driven by singular motivation") dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    Template cadence ("As they walked... As constellations shifted... As they continued") triggers -0.6 loop penalty. "Trepidation and wonder" uses therapy-speak label where embodied contradiction was needed, dulling climax impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "ink flowed onto a blank page" shows rather than tells. Slight overwriting in "testament to the anomaly's unique properties" but no muddle in peak beats. Final line avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong density and cadence, but "map of emotions" abstraction in peak signing scene introduces minor scaffold; final image rescues closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops: "faded tapestry fragment" repeats 5x in final 100 words with identical phrasing. "Volcanic tenderness" is therapy-speak label; "whispers of the past" creates mixed metaphor. Final paragraph's abstract moralizing dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong textural specificity ("diamond" stars, "metallic surface") but paraphrase loops in emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow" repeated without deepening embodiment; "bittersweet feeling" abstracts state). Final image avoids muddle, though "fleeting moment" phrasing risks scaffold in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor density issues ("geomagnetic storm raging... spin wildly" redundancy) and template cadence ("As she walked... As she turned") but strong propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality; no closure-beat artifacts prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops ("stillwater tension" x4, "silent empathy" x3) and therapy-speak ("spiralingly calm") in closure beats dull immediacy; final image’s lyricism can’t offset scaffolded redundancy across the dock scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.6)
    Closure-beat artifacts: "forests of second thoughts" is stock metaphor; template cadence ("As the starlight returned...") dulls final image. Paraphrase loops ("mist that shrouded the town" x3) and therapy-speak ("amplified quiet") obscure cost legibility. Overwriting in peak beats disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "heart unlock, its guarded depths revealed" uses therapy-speak labels; scaffold phrasing ("felt an inexplicable pull") dulls immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in thematic summaries ("enduring power of memory") and one paraphrase loop ("slowly begun to heal... scars still lingered") prevent 9.0, but propulsion remains clean in high-pressure beats like the final darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loops cripple climax: "tremor of certainty" repeats verbatim 3x in final third. Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt...") dull immediacy; "lantern-moth hush" synonym churn triggers -0.7 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean syntax with purposeful fragments ("After the phoenix rises...") but minor overwriting: "whisper a gentle melody" strains metaphor logic. No fatal loops, though "innocently cunning" label repeats without embodied proof. Final line’s "soft whisper" lacks closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Competent lyricism with sensory density, but minor scaffold ("soft glow... illuminating") and template cadence ("As they moved...") reduce propulsion; no fatal loops, yet "golden shadows" reprise lacks closure charge; strong verbs diluted by excessive modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong textural specificity ("ripple and flow like liquid") diluted by paraphrase loops: "genuinely artificial, crafted from finest materials" restates redundantly. Final paragraph's "kaleidoscope" overwriting weakens closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    Template cadence ("With each...") and paraphrase loops ("mystery deepening"/"fabric revealed") dull momentum. Filter-verb stack in closure beat ("felt herself becoming a conduit") triggers -1.0 artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence in "As she..." constructions and paraphrase loops ("anguished joy" x4 with minimal variation) dull closure beat. Final paragraph's "journey had been worth the anguish and the joy" redundantly echoes prior labels without deepening, violating momentum in critical payoff zone.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwritten sensory density ("sweet scent of parchment," "luminescent orbs") creates minor scaffold; "danced across yellowed paper" muddles action with metaphor in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: metaphors pile up ("sculpture from marble," "delicate glass vessel") without pattern-teaching, obscuring emotional truth; template cadence ("As she...") dulls immediacy in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong opening cadence degrades into telling ("felt a strange sense of comfort") and redundant modifiers ("dull ache crept back"). "Frosted hourglass" recurrence lacks evolving specificity; "meteor hush" feels pasted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe paraphrase loops: "room faded... transported" adjacent sentences. Filter-verb stack in climax ("felt atmosphere thickening... felt music awakening... felt weight lifting") triggers -0.5 penalty. Final paragraph synonym churn ("secrets uncovered/yielded/unlocking") dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt the weight lifting," "knew rest was essential"); stock metaphors ("wings of pure enchantment") dilute closure image despite otherwise rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    Overwriting in climax ("kaleidoscope of color and sound" violates physical logic); template cadence in descriptions ("As she walked... The air vibrated..."). No closure-impacting loops, but density issues dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops ("trees seemed to fade... blurring into distance" then "wind rustled... melody familiar and strange") and template cadence (7+ "As he..." openings). Final beat has synonym churn ("hum remained... gentle buzzing... emanate from fabric of reality"), dulling closure image per Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rhythmic control falters with repetitive cadence ("The [adjective] [noun] [verb]...") in 7/10 opening lines, creating drumbeat monotony. Overwriting in "otherworldly energy," "expectant hush" dilutes momentum. Final-third artifact ("mist that had veiled...") uses identical structure to opening, disallowing 9+ globally per rules.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with propulsion: "dusty spiral staircase" does triple duty (setting/constraint/symbol). Minor synonym churn ("stillness was almost palpable, a heavy blanket") and "nerve regeneration" jargon break POV lexicon. Final image ("snow finally began to clear") crystallizes closure without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("leaving behind a trail..."; "library forever changed") and filter verbs ("Kael knew," "Kael's presence became") dull immediacy. "Constellations shifted" cliché; final line ("beacon shining brightly") overwrites with abstraction. No closure artifacts, but mid-story template cadence ("As the constellations... Kael worked...") repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Beautiful imagery undermined by template cadence ("Maya's gaze... Maya's thoughts...") and stock phrase "periodically eternal" in peak beat; no closure-adjacent loops but scaffold weakens momentum in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor abstraction ("weight of insignificance") and near-synonym churn ("reignited the spark"/"rekindled the fire") in mid-beats; final image avoids overwriting, but "twinkled in anticipation" edges toward sentimentality, narrowly avoiding Q7's 9+ requirement for zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold loops ("whispers... rose to fevered pitch... rose to triumphant chorus") dull immediacy. Overwritten metaphors ("lotus blooming in the sun") slightly muddle climax. Strong verbs and sensory texture mostly propel momentum without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with dual-purpose lines ("wind dying down, trees ceasing creaking" mirrors internal calm); slight scaffold in repeated "reaching out" tree imagery prevents 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Template cadence in closure ("As she vanished... tomes whispered... artist's spirit remained") triggers -0.5. Synonym churn ("fractured/disjointed/shattered") and "luminescent ache" repetition create scaffold loops, dulling final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythm with varied syntax ("Their consciously wild hair...whipped about"), but adjacent paraphrase loops ("faint smudge...faintest hint") and elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose loops with synonym churn ("serene quiet" → "no longer still" → "whispers mingled with murmurs") and stock metaphors ("dark confession"); "bravely conflicted heart" label violates diagnostic-speak rule in peak transmission beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Loops mar peak beats: "tranquil blaze" repeats verbatim, and "senselessly perceptive" is reiterated without deepening. Overwritten phrases ("serenely dedicated," "gentle hum of carefully cultivated life") slow momentum. Strong verbs ("unfold," "coaxed") are diluted by redundant modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Metaphor repetition ("patterns break themselves") borders on synonym churn, and "heart sang with excitement" uses label-only emotion in a peak beat. Strong rhythm otherwise, but these artifacts dull closure's immediacy despite purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    Paraphrase loops ("gazing out... scanning the horizon") and therapy-speak ("orbits of regret") in final third dull closure impact; filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy during pen-nib handling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    Overwriting in "shadows twisting like living things" followed by "time folding" creates mixed metaphors in pressure beat; paraphrase loop in "gentle susurrus... weight of stars" triggers -0.3 density penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence ("As she worked... As the design...") and "lilac unease" repetition (4x) in final third trigger -0.5 artifact penalty; beautiful imagery but scaffold loops dull closure momentum without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mixed metaphor ("a coldness that was not quite cold") and cliché loops ("glimmer of hope," "beacon of warmth") in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("She turned... She began... She stood") triggers -0.5 penalty for dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Overwriting plagues climax: figurative language saturates 80% of sentences ("trees vibrating with otherworldly energy"), while template cadence ("As [X], Echo felt [Y]") repeats four times. Final paragraph’s "faint echo of a bygone era" cliché dulls closure imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Minor scaffold in opening ("fascinated and intimidated... Despite risks") creates synonym loop. Strong verbs ("muscovite geode sliver glittered") offset slight purple prose ("sea of mental images"). Final "peace settle over her" edges toward sentimentality without earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Paraphrase loops plague momentum: "full of secrets... still much to discover" then "mysteries... ready to uncover." Final beat’s filter-verb stack ("felt a sense... felt a deep sense...") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. Template cadence in exploration beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elegant prose undermined by filter-verb stacks in closure ("the turner realized... smiled... returned") and thematic echo ("raw possibility"). Synonym churn on "tangled skein" and abstract density ("weight of unspoken words") dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("mist swirled around her" verbatim twice) and template cadence ("she felt... she felt") in closure beat trigger −0.5. Filter-verb stacks ("began to scan," "began to search") dull immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold appears ("as the mist swirled... as they reached... as he worked"), slowing momentum with repetitive "as" clauses, but rhythm variation and clean grammar prevent severe deduction. Final image’s "lapping water echo through eternity" avoids figurative muddle, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Minor scaffold in reflective blocks ("As she pondered..."; "As chimney smoke...") dulls momentum, but lyrical cadence ("fluid, like unfolding lotus") avoids fatal loops in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Paraphrase loops ("quivering hush gave way to calm... gave way to new day") and stacked filter verbs ("their eyes were drawn," "thoughts turned to") dull immediacy. Final paragraph's redundant abstractions ("delicate thing, requiring care") trigger Overwriting Checks; template cadence in closure beat disallows 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Synonym loops weaken momentum: "fragility of existence became starkly apparent, like shattering glass" then "brittle awakenings that had driven her thus far." Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra's thoughts were consumed," "Lyra's mind still reeling") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion via varied syntax, but paraphrase loops ("sweet scent of blooming flowers" repeated verbatim) and minor scaffold in reflection blocks trigger -0.3 deduction. Figurative language remains coherent, yet "whimsy that had always defined her" risks label-speak in peak beat. Final image clarity prevents higher penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    Adjacent paraphrase loops ("ethereal grit... fabric of reality reshaped" followed by "hiss gave way to new sound"). Figurative density high in climax (3 metaphors in 2 lines), triggering overwriting penalty. Scaffold reduces propulsion despite strong opening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    Template cadence ("Lyra felt... replaced by...") and filter-verb stacks ("Lyra felt an inexplicable connection") in high-pressure beats. Thematic echo ("testament to prudently adventurous spirits") triggers -0.5 penalty. Artifacts dull closure image despite strong opening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops and high density, but clinical metaphor "lance the boil" violates POV lexicon in high-pressure moment (-0.3), preventing 9+ despite otherwise flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Template cadence in repetitive "Emilia's..." openings (7 instances) dulls momentum; "spongey dread" functions as mixed metaphor violating physical logic. High-pressure beats ("dread surrounding her grew thicker") suffer stock phrasing that obscures emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting plagues peak beats: "river of light," "luminous disbelief," and "sculpt possibility" stack abstract metaphors; template cadence ("As they stood... As the notes faded... As they packed") dulls closure momentum in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Synonym loops ("dusky harmony"/"polished calm") in final beats trigger -0.6 artifact penalty; foreign money descriptions lack textural specificity.

    Prose loops undermine momentum: "As [temporal phrase]..." cadence repeats 5x. Overwritten metaphors ("stars twinkle in rhythm with thoughts") blur causality without payoff in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong atmospheric phrases marred by template cadence ("The druid noticed that..."). Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("they saw that it was holding...") dull immediacy; moralizing finale creates scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening cadence stumbles into paraphrase loops ("anxious elation" repeated verbatim) and stock metaphors ("fabric of reality"). Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "felt the tug") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops and high density ("fiercely gentle touch" shows specificity), but "trammel the darkness" registers as forced abstraction in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops in peak beats, but "confidently uncertain" label appears twice as scaffold; final paragraph's "symphony of possibilities" edges toward overwriting yet avoids muddle through concrete star imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Repetitive abstraction loops ("sense of," "feeling of") dull momentum in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stacks ("began to ponder," "felt herself drawing closer") trigger scaffold penalty, obscuring immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong textural density with minimal loops, yet "soothing melody" cliché and "flowed like the tides" weaken specificity. Final third's "symbol of simple beauty" is tell-not-show, disqualifying 9+ despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops ("latent radiance" ×3, "resonant hush" ×2) clutter peak beats; final line's generic "hidden wonders" symbolism lacks textural specificity to charge closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("mended and broken" repeated verbatim) and filter-verb clusters ("her eyes wandered," "thoughts turned") in critical beats dull momentum without payoff pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid textural density falters with synonym churn ("swirling"/"parting" mist) and three "cautious exuberance" repetitions; final paragraph's looped "mist" phrasing dulls closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops ("promise... losing its glow" → "act before too late") and template cadence ("As she...") in final beat. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate") and final "she knew" triplet obscure closure image with scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Template cadence runs ("Aria's hands moved... Aria's mind wandered...") trigger -0.6. Filter-verb stacks ("began to discern," "began to slow") obscure immediacy in high-pressure beats, but lyrical density ("radiant hush," "symphony of light") saves momentum until the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.6)
    Repetitive scaffold loops ("vineyard hush" x3, "umbral grotto" x4) and nonsensical verbs ("scallop the clouds") obscure causality; final paragraph's synonym churn ("sanctuary," "haven," "serenity") dilutes closure image with redundant telling.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Template cadence in "As they listened... As they worked..." weakens propulsion; the mixed metaphor ("complex web... like fishing net") and overwritten finale ("whispered promise of complexities") trigger −0.5 per Text-Artifact Screen, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    Paraphrase loops: "patterns in the pond" restated 3x consecutively. Overwriting in peak beats—metaphor density obscures causality ("concentric rings" described 4x without progression).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.8)
    Template cadence ("The skimmer’s...") and "as the dust continued to fall" repetition trigger scaffold penalties. Final-third artifacts ("pulse... now a part of the skimmer") dull closure. Abstract labels ("weathered resolve") replace concrete propulsion, harming momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    Repetitive phrasing ("lingering luminance" x4) and template cadence in climax: "felt... felt... felt." Overwritten peaks ("surge of energy course through veins") dilute tension. Final paragraph's parallel structure ("With...", "As...") creates mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting in climax: stacked modifiers ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "palpable energy") create density muddle; paraphrase loops ("truth hiding behind words... look beyond surface") trigger −0.4 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Beautiful rhythm in opening, but overwriting dilutes climax: "shimmering droplet... imbued with essence" uses stacked modifiers. Filter-verb clusters ("could glean," "felt a thrill") dull immediacy in high-pressure distillation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    Paraphrase loop in final beats ("sense of melancholy longing"/"sense of peace"); template cadence ("As the...") weakens propulsion. Filter-verb stack ("began to emanate... started to crystallize") dulls immediacy in closure beat, disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "rebuild what was broken... mend cracks... restore glory" (lines 5-6). Filter-verb stack ("knew that to rebuild... needed method") dulls immediacy. Final image's "plausible impossibility" suffers mixed metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose avoids scaffold but over-relies on elevated abstractions ("precisely humane touch," "resonant reconfiguration"); minor density issues in reflective passages dilute momentum, though no closure-obscuring artifacts mar the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong textural specificity ("frozen dew crystal," "fragrant mist") but paraphrase loops ("sense of wonder"/"touch of wonder") and template cadence ("As she..., Elara...") dull high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loop: "silence... palpable, a soundless echo that seemed to reverberate" (adjacent redundancy). Filter-verb stack near closure ("Lyra felt... knew... would return") dulls immediacy. High-density prose saved by "velvet expanse" specificity, but template cadence ("As the night wore on...") triggers -0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops plague key beats ("numbness that had plagued... threatened to consume him"). Filter-verb stacks ("Kaito felt... felt... felt") in final paragraph dull immediacy despite otherwise clean prose.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure-beat artifacts: synonym loops ("sparked chain of creativity... new wave of innovation"), overwriting in finale. Template cadence ("As she..., she...") clusters in pivotal dawn scene, dulling cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym loops ("mournful melody"/"sorrowful tune") and label-heavy phrasing ("unspoken emotions") dull two high-pressure beats. Strong propulsion otherwise, but artifacts prevent 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor abstraction ("morbid perfume") in high-pressure beats, but density remains high. Final image avoids overwriting: "pendant remained, a tangible connection" charges closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Template cadence in climax ("As the energy reached... pushed to limit... remained steadfast") and redundant phrasing ("dance of creation and destruction that seemed to capture essence"). Final third artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility despite strong opening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops ("atmosphere alive with anticipation... serenely electric") and template cadence ("As she..., she...") in high-pressure beats. Final image dulled by redundant "magic beyond perception" after established closure attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Heavy scaffold: "voice steady and reassuring as she reported" tells emotion already shown. Template cadence ("As she walked...") in discovery beat. Final paragraph’s "shifting, flowing... ride the tide" is purple prose diluting closure. Filter-verb stack disallows 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "memories began to alter, shifting and reforming like a living thing" achieve triple duty (action/image/theme). No figurative muddle even in high-pressure climax beats.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.3)
    Template cadence runs ("As she [verb], Lyra [verb]") across 8+ sentences; paraphrase loops ("darkness stretched like canvas... stars twinkled like diamonds"); stock metaphors in final third dull closure image, triggering -1.7 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose avoids fatal artifacts but has scaffold ("Aria felt an instant connection... sense of responsibility") and repetitive "gentle" modifiers. Final beat slightly overwritten ("sound... grew fainter, until it was just a memory"). Information density high yet propulsion falters in reflection ("the sound... echoing through her mind"). No closure-dulling loops.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Minor redundancies ("navigated... with ease," "made her way deeper") and scaffolded telling ("her mind racing with implications") sap momentum; no fatal loops but density suffers in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Template cadence cripples momentum: "As [X], Akira felt [Y]" repeats 4x with filter-verb stacks. Closure beat suffers from "serene landscape that seemed to echo stillness"—synonym loop muddying the shard's final significance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stunning imagery but paraphrase loop ("patterns shifting and evolving" duplicated in final paragraph) dulls closure beat. Overwritten moments ("symphony of movement that belied chaos") risk muddle yet serve accumulative density.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.6)
    Overwriting sinks closure: "frostbitten hope" repeats 3x in final 70 words with synonym churn ("glimmer of light," "sense of determination"), forming a paraphrase loop that dulls the Charged Poise image per Q7 loop penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythm and specificity ("locust shell's delicate curves"), but scaffold loops in opening ("Luna played... Luna's music... Luna began") and redundant "resonantly soft" mentions dull immediacy. No closure-obscuring artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to grow more turbulent," "seemed to reach a crescendo") in the border-crossing climax dull immediacy; paraphrase loops ("thunderstorm inside raged"/"fury still raging") create scaffold without pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity ("rusty wheels," "faded paint") but paraphrase loops: "misting hush" appears 5x with near-identical phrasing. Filter verbs ("seemed to carry," "realized they had") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean grammar with strong textural specificity ("gnarled tree," "sandalwood tang"), but minor scaffold: filter verbs ("as if searching," "seemed to glow") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final line's "richer, more wondrous place" borders on sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong opening rhythm degrades into paraphrase loops: "luminous absence" appears 4x with near-identical phrasing, and "cipher of longing" recycles without deepening. Final paragraph’s "journey remained a mystery" feels summarily redundant, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion until climax: "tools... used with finesse" shows concrete action. But "surge of improbable longing" is label-heavy; "cosmic possibility" repetition creates synonym churn. Final line ("stars twinkled in approval") borders on cliché, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure beat suffers filter-verb stacking ("felt a sense of resolve," "knew that," "felt the weight") and overwritten cadence ("ready to face whatever lay ahead"). Dulls the final image’s propulsion despite otherwise strong lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong textural specificity ("oily liquid," "dust motes danced") but suffers paraphrase loops: "archivist's eyes" repeated 4x with near-identical emphasis on fixation, dulling immediacy in high-pressure annotation beats. Final image avoids muddle, yet cadence stutters with sequential "as" clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive overwriting: paraphrase loops ("soft golden light"/"warm golden light"), stock metaphors ("riot of color"), and filter-verb stacks ("she felt the energy... she felt herself drawn") dull closure. Final paragraph’s thematic echo compounds momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "kaleidoscope of colors across the restorer's hands" exemplifies high-density textural propulsion. Only minor risk: "velvety stillness" slightly borders on purple prose but stays voice-motivated in context.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.9)
    Severe filter-verb stacks in climax ("felt shiver... felt focus deepen... felt awe") obscure causality. Template cadence in final paragraph ("felt sense of... felt reverence... felt peace") triggers -0.5 penalty. Closure image blurred by overwriting ("soothing melody," "siren call").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in "sophisticated sorrow"—therapy-speak label in high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Otherwise, prose avoids loops; final line's snow metaphor delivers closure without muddle, though abstraction slightly obscures emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong textural specificity ("subtle ridges of engravings") but suffers paraphrase loops: "swirling mist" repeats identically across beats. Template cadence ("As she sat... As she worked...") in high-pressure scene triggers -0.4 penalty without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("frost-etched walls," "ethereal light") with clean grammar, but paraphrase loops ("uncovered secrets"/"uncovering secrets") and template cadence ("Elara felt... Elara's motivation...") dull momentum. Final paragraph's scaffold ("ready to continue... less isolated") prevents 8.0+ despite otherwise vivid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    High density in atmospheric descriptions but final beat suffers template cadence ("Lyra felt... her heart swelled... eyes shining") diluting closure impact; minimal synonym loops outside peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Fractally precise renderings" risks thesaurus-itis but pays off in motif; minor scaffold in "faint, swirling patterns... faint indentations" causes slight redundancy, though final image's propulsion ("glow with otherworldly light") rescues closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with zero loops; "dog-ear on page 37 fluttering" shows textural specificity. Slight overwriting in "whispers weaving in and out of creaks and groans" dilutes momentum near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.7)
    High textural density with resonant phrases ("driftwood nostalgia"), but adjacent paraphrase loops ("stepped into the library... footsteps echoed" / "navigating frozen shelves") dull momentum. Template cadence ("As they...") recurs 4x, though not in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Template cadence: "As..., [subject]..." opens 4 paragraphs. Paraphrase loops ("struggles and triumphs... hardship... thriving community"). Filter-verb stack in paragraph 5 ("began to sense... realized... began to reexamine") dulls immediacy. Final line overwrites with abstract resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    Repetitive "hush" cadence (7+ uses) and template stems ("As they worked... As the light deepened") create paraphrase loops; "burden of bruised awe" qualifies as therapy-speak in peak beat, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean prose with strong verbs ("trudged," "swooped"), but filter verbs ("she felt") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold in opening ("weight settling heavy" cliché), yet no figurative muddle. Final image’s "delicate veil of ice" achieves high textural specificity without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("lapping of water... soothing melody" / "sound of water... like music") trigger -0.2. Strong textural specificity in "intricate networks of fibers" but "loosened grief" drifts into diagnostic label-speak near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("refracting soft, diffused light"), but synonym loops weaken key beats: "mindfully scattered" repeats without deepening. Filter-verbs ("felt an unexpected sense") slightly blunt immediacy, though no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold: "damp from recent rain" repeats verbatim. Otherwise exemplary propulsion—tidal pool sequence weaves action/perception ("fingers brushed against the sand"). Final line avoids cliché by tying "resilience" to concrete fortress imagery. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.6)
    Overwriting cripples momentum: "velvet expanse," "diamonds scattered," and duplicated "hush of borrowed starlight" create cliché loops. "Rhythmic heartbeat" metaphor violates clock mechanics. Final paragraph’s abstract hope drains closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Severe line-level artifacts: "chaotically precise mind" repeats verbatim, "entangled memories" churns as thematic mantra, and "quaking reverie... reverberate through every molecule" creates mixed metaphor. Template cadence ("As she worked... As the night wore on") triggers -0.5 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure beat contains paraphrase loop ("secrets to uncover/seeds to nurture/journey far from over") and template cadence ("As she [verb]..."). Figurative muddle: "threshold effects" overused as explanation without concrete manifestation, dulling final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fingers stained with soil and sap" conveys craft and setting). Weakness: minor overwriting in closure ("forever changed," "quiet heartbeat" borders on cliché). Final image clear with no figurative muddle. Strength: strategic telling compresses time ("Years might pass..."); weakness: "testament" repeated without variation, slight redundancy in "felt the empathy... began to take hold."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence ("he felt... he recalled...") and mixed metaphor ("silence palpable, a living entity") create paraphrase loops that obscure causal progression in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Template cadence cripples climax: "As she read... As she did so... As the silence deepened" (three identical openings). Final image dulled by clichés ("stars twinkled like diamonds") and abstraction; filter-verb stack ("she felt her own frequencies... creating a harmony") triggers -0.5 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.1)
    Severe template cadence: "Lyra felt..." opens 5+ sentences in climax. Filter-verb stack ("felt surge... felt senses expand... felt serenity wash") in high-pressure beat triggers -0.5 penalty. Final line overwritten: "wildflower hush that echoed through the trees" drowns specificity in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mixed metaphor "whirling silence, a cacophony of sound that was somehow quiet" violates physical logic (-0.5). Otherwise strong propulsion, but "ethereal fingers" simile during climax uses generic lyricism where concrete specificity would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythm but scaffold issues: "silence was oppressive... silence seemed to press in" creates paraphrase loop. Template cadence in survey sequence ("pulled out... began to survey... noticed") mildly dulls immediacy, though final line avoids cliché with "hazy precision."

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Severe overwriting in climax: 82% of sentences deploy stacked modifiers ("soft, harmonious hum," "ethereal light," "kaleidoscope of colors"); filter-verb stack ("sought to certify," "aimed to unfetter") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "avalanchingly quiet" repetition and template cadence in flute description ("it was as if...") create subtle synonym churn. No closure-dulling artifacts, though figurative density slightly overpowers pressure in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Repetitive phrasing ("eyes gleamed") and passive constructions ("air seemed to thicken") dull key beats. Overwriting in climax ("kaleidoscope of emotions that seemed to shift and writhe") obscures the pivotal moment despite otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose flows with sensory density and varied syntax, but template cadence ("As she..., the pendant...") recurs in opening beats; minor figurative muddle ("germinating connection") slightly dulls closure’s resonance without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong lyrical rhythm but "truthful lies" repetition creates synonym churn (3x in final third). Fatal simultaneity error: "felt the mist begin to clear" clashes with "mist swirled around her" in same beat, obscuring cause/effect and dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.3)
    Template cadence runs ("As she worked... As she began... As the image took shape") trigger -0.6 penalty. Synonym churn on "raveling silence" (4 repetitions with minimal variation) and redundant "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" phrasing create scaffold loops that obscure pressure in final third, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Three filter-verb stacks in climax ("I felt," "I knew," "I saw") dull immediacy; mixed metaphors ("phoenix from ashes" amid orchard imagery) create coherence issues; lyrical overwriting in "azure defiance" violates POV lexicon under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwriting muddles closure: "kaleidoscope of images... threatened to overwhelm" stacks vague metaphors in high-stakes beat. Template cadence ("The map maker's [body part] [verb]") recurs 5x, dulling the final image's conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose flows with purposeful cadence ("meditative," "repetitive motion"), but near-synonym loops ("deep and abiding sorrow"/"luminescent ache") in the closure beat slightly muddle emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong imagery but scaffolded telling ("she believed," "she knew") dulls immediacy in key beats. Template cadence in ritual descriptions ("With each precise adjustment... she felt...") triggers minor loop penalty, though closure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting muddles peak beats: "quietly explosive aroma," "valley-mist wonder" create register drift. Template cadence ("As he [verb]...") in opening violates sentence-variation rule. Filter-verb clusters in closure beat (-0.5 penalty) obscure conceptual cost, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Template cadence loops ("As they...") in final third dull closure momentum, but strategic telling compresses backstory cleanly. "Heart was full of purpose" exemplifies scaffold phrasing that slightly obscures emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops dominate climax: "weaving threads of woven dawns... swaddle of sound... woven dawns hallmark" in three consecutive lines. Filter-verb stacks ("felt drawn," "began to hum") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat, disqualifying 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean prose but cadence loops ("As midnight drew near... As the clock struck... As dawn crept") dilute momentum; filter verbs ("Elys felt," "became absorbed") reduce immediacy. Final paragraph's sequential "as" clauses slightly muddle propulsion without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Minor scaffold in backstory summary: "Some said it was... while others claimed..." paraphrase loop interrupts flow. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw") accumulate but avoid peak-beat severity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops ("illusions of the past began to fade to memory" repeated), synonym churn ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"). Final image dulled by "shard of luminous vows" abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Template cadence proliferates in climax ("Lena took a step... her voice... Lena's hand..."), while abstract phrases ("truce of hush," "sound of trust breaking") muddle meaning. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+; density issues trigger -0.7 deduction for figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Template cadence in climax ("Aria felt... Aria sensed... Aria knew") and abstract modifiers ("ethereal glow," "futuristic nostalgia") dull closure. Paraphrase loop: "subtle forces"/"subtle changes" in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold in "auroral sorrow" repetition and mixed metaphor ("slow uncorking of a bottle") create subtle momentum drag, but high density in sketching sequence prevents closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops, high density ("shimmer in dim light"), but "transience and beauty" risks abstract tell; final line's concrete reprise avoids thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe overwriting: "glistened" appears 5 times with redundant modifiers ("intense," "otherworldly"). Template cadence ("As... Aria's...") in 7+ sentences creates drumbeat rhythm. Final paragraph's "reminder of beauty" is pure thematic echo—text-artifact that dulls closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.5)
    Filter-verb stack ("Aria felt... she knew... Aria watched") in high-pressure fire beat triggers −0.5 penalty; paraphrase loops ("inner static" repetition) and minor overwriting obscure propulsion despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strategic telling dominates pivotal beats (writer’s backstory summarized), while "healing power of listening" phrasing triggers −0.4 thematic artifact penalty; clean syntax but momentum loss in mid-scene exposition loops.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    Repetitive scaffold ("mysterious familiarity" twice, verbatim "scent of saltwater" recurrence) creates paraphrase loops; while rhythm supports mood, these artifacts dull closure momentum without pattern-teaching payoff in the escape beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Gleaming silence" recurs with near-synonym churn ("serene quality," "soothing melody"), creating scaffold. Final line ("journey was far from over") delivers propulsion, but "flood of memories" uses generic metaphor in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.7)
    Pervasive synonym loops ("tranquil atmosphere"/"tranquility"/"tranquil blaze") and template cadence ("as they breathed... as they entered...") dull closure image. Overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic energy" strings) obscures causality despite lyrical intent.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("words flowing like a river") serves accumulative pressure without muddle. Final line's "sound of the stars" risks purple prose but fits voice-driven rhythm. Minor near-miss: "weaving a spell of mysterious familiarity" slightly strains metaphor but redeems through context.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.7)
    Text loops plague high-pressure beats: "quarantined memory" → "forgotten memories" → "suppressed" with synonym churn; "ghostly resolve" is vague abstraction. "Resonance structures" introduces jargon that obscures causality, and final line’s "faded into morning light" is cliché, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    Heavy figurative muddle in peak beats: "words seemed to take on a life of their own" and "calmly and unsettling" create contradictory physical logic. Template cadence ("As... the forger...") repeats 5x in final third, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Synonym churn in peak beats: "whispers/murmurs/vibrates" cluster creates paraphrase loops. Overwriting in "serpentine nexus under starlight" opening—redundant lyricism dulls momentum without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "a trail of candlelight and the faintest hint of starlight" stacks modifiers. Paraphrase loops ("salvage something pure from the wreckage" repeated verbatim) and template cadence ("As she...") dull propulsion. Final third artifacts disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("hidden patterns" repeated 4x) and occasional overwriting ("ethereal glow," "soothing serenade") dull momentum in middle beats. High density otherwise—bamboo whisk description advances character/theme simultaneously. Final line's firefly "whisper" avoids sentimentality through concrete image, but template cadence in garden walk slightly impedes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold loops ("Aria's... Aria's... Aria felt") and repetitive openings weaken propulsion. Clean grammar but "mind racing with possibilities" is stock phrasing; final line achieves textural specificity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    Template cadence ("As she stood... As she listened... As days passed") triggers -0.5 loop penalty. Synonym churn ("unfolding narrative"/"piecing together mosaic") bloats high-pressure beats. Final image ("disappeared into the dawn") suffers figurative muddle, dulling closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "patchwork of lost opportunities/silence oppressive" creates adjacent paraphrase loop; final image retains clarity despite borderline figurative density in dawn descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Final paragraph paraphrase loops ("sense of peace... satisfaction... purpose") dull closure. "Fleshly ethereal" redundancy and vague "vibrational matching" mechanics reduce clarity. Strong opening line, but abstraction replaces textural specificity in peak beats. Template cadence in adaptation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Template cadence ("As she walked... As she stood...") creates paraphrase loops; "softly purposeful" repeated without variation. Final image’s "inner light" overwrites concrete cost with vague lyricism, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("entangled memories"/"shedding a skin") and abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability") create scaffold; final beat clear yet lacks zero-loop precision for 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and sensory specificity marred by minor loops ("vibrant hush" reused verbatim) and abstract labels ("renewed sense of purpose") that reduce propulsion in key beats without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe" repeats) and syntactic uniformity. Final third contains filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she had discovered") dulling closure. Template cadence in high-pressure beats disallows 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("haunting sense of absence"/"sensed absence") and template cadence ("As she...") in mid-beats; strong specificity ("4-1-5-9") but final image lacks textural charge to elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops ("I felt a sense of...") and template cadence ("As I [verb], I [verb]") trigger -1.2 artifact penalty. Final paragraph's thematic echo dulls closure image; "windborne solace" repetition exemplifies scaffold that obscures emotional progression despite lyrical strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Passionate subtlety" repeats verbatim three times (paragraphs 8, 14, 15), creating paraphrase loops that dull immediacy; otherwise strong density and rhythm, though final-paragraph thematic echo slightly muddles closure's conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    Figurative language overloads high-pressure beats ("words like a gentle breeze carrying essence," "fabric of reality reshaped"), creating mixed vehicles and register drift; template cadence in consecration sequence dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "sense of peace" verbatim repetition in final beats; template stems ("as she walked... as she stood..."). Closure-beat artifacts dull cost legibility (-1.7 penalty applied).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, but "weathered innocence" and "red-rimmed from lack of sleep" verge on bodily clichés; final third avoids artifacts though "sonically reflective" slightly drifts lexicon in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero loops; high density ("chalk worn to a stub, its purpose fulfilled"). Minor deduction for "precognitive forgetfulness" label in peak beat, but final image’s cadence shift ("statues stood unchanging, yet somehow different") delivers flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    "Earth tremors were a sign that the very fabric..." is overwritten abstraction during crisis. Paraphrase loop in "he began to ponder... he wondered" dulls momentum. Final paragraph cadence shifts effectively but "forever changed" is cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor overwriting in "scent of hope" repetitions (5x) and "pulsing stillness" cliché, but no closure-dulling artifacts. Strong propulsion via concrete verbs ("weave soundscape," "breathing slowed"); final line's "waft" recharges motif with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("Lyra was a budding rune scholar... driven by insatiable curiosity" adjacent to "quietly deliberate" restatement) dull momentum. No figurative muddle, but template cadence ("Lyra believed... Lyra was convinced...") slightly impedes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("feeling a sense of wonder... tranquil atmosphere"; "sense of clarity... sense of purpose"). Template cadence in "As she stood there..." clusters weaken propulsion in high-pressure beats near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loops in luminescence descriptions ("soft, inner light... gentle light beacon") trigger -0.3. Strong propulsion otherwise, but "zephyr bloom" repetition dulls closure image without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero figurative muddle; "amber pendant glinting" offers crystalline specificity. Minor paraphrase loop in "Aria felt... yet she was determined" slightly dulls propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete image ("spirit freer").

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("swirling mist"/"swirling patterns"/"swirling hush") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt... she knew...") in climax dull immediacy. Template cadence ("she felt a sense of...") pervades final third, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact policy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening rhythm falters with scaffolding: "a haunting, lilting tune that seemed to capture..." overwrites melody's impact. Synonym churn in communal scenes ("curiosity and longing," "communal wonder") dulls immediacy. Final image avoids closure artifacts but mid-scene loops cap high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats, but adjacent-line paraphrase loop: "stillness so profound it felt as though the world was holding its breath" (para 3) vs. identical phrasing later (para 5). High density maintained except for "safekept starlight" abstraction diluting closure’s concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythm and specificity but scaffold loops: "soft glow" (crystals/device), "peripherally focused gaze" repeated. Near-closure metaphor ("thrill of excitement") slightly overwrought yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythm and specificity marred by paraphrase loops ("With each step... With each passing moment") and filter-verb stacks in climax ("the weaver felt," "she closed," "began to weave"). Final-third artifacts dull closure’s propulsion despite otherwise controlled prose.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops with strong propulsion, but "hauntingly practical" triggers Patterned-artifact penalty. "Palpable weight" and "rust-hued" avoid cliché yet final "contain" phrasing slightly overwrites emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion with minimal scaffold, but "fractured stillness" repeats without deepening, and elevated diction ("resolute," "eroded ambitions") creates register drift in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Template cadence ("Maya's [noun] [verb]ed") repeats 5x; paraphrase loops ("dusty surfaces gleaming"/"terminal transformed"). Minor but pervasive momentum drag in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("calming his thoughts and soothing his soul") and redundant "crystal whispering forecourt" mentions reduce density. Figurative language remains clear in closure beat, avoiding critical muddle despite moderate scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt...") and template cadence ("As she gazed... As the stars...") in final third dull closure image. Filter-verb stacks in climax beat disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("glassy texture," "mournful tone") but template cadence emerges in closure ("She felt... She felt..."). Zero figurative muddle yet minor synonym loops ("soothing sounds"/"ocean's hush") dull final propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Synonym loops ("mournful sigh"/"melancholic shadows") and thematic labeling ("vividly descriptive") dull momentum. Final beat's "bittersweet reminder" overwrites concrete imagery, violating show-don't-tell in closure proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Template cadence ("The prince felt... The prince worked... The prince's thoughts...") in high-pressure beats triggers -0.4 penalty; lyrical density obscures propulsion during device assembly, with final-third artifacts dulling closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loop in final third ("Aria felt a sense of peace... Aria felt a deep sense of connection") triggers -0.5 penalty. Template cadence ("Aria felt...") dulls closure image despite otherwise clean syntax and purposeful sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong density but paraphrase loops ("determination grew... moved with quiet confidence") and therapy-speak ("heart swelled with excitement and trepidation") dull key moments. Final paragraph’s "would soon become triumphant cry" breaks immediacy, though imagery remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Template cadence ("As they strolled/worked/continued") creates paraphrase loops in high-pressure beats. "Deep, ethereal light" and "troubling serenity" are abstract labels lacking textural specificity. Final line’s "approximated infinity" muddles closure with conceptual vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with purposeful variation, though "calm" repetition (4x) and "gentle" overuse create subtle loops. Minor scaffold in "her mind tracing the path..." and subject-verb error ("weight... begin to shift") prevent 9+ without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "stillness give way to motion" echoed later as "stillness give way to purpose". Consistent voice but "searing reverie" is mixed metaphor; final image retains clarity despite artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Template cadence ("As the sun dipped...", "As they entered...", "As the night wore on") triggers -0.5 penalty; lyrical density falters in final third with abstract assertions like "journey was far from over".

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Duplicate phrasing ("pen hovered, poised") creates paraphrase loop; "groundedly imaginative" label repeats without embodiment. Overwritten peaks ("kaleidoscope of possibility") dilute momentum in high-pressure beats. Minor artifacts avoid closure damage but cap density below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Final third filter-verb stacks ("Emilia felt," "she knew") dull climax immediacy. Paraphrase loops ("mist-shrouded," "shrouded in mist") persist, but lyrical cadence and sensory specificity partially offset momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density excels in setting descriptions, but "weaves truth carefully into the fabric" is therapy-speak label violating peak-beat embodiment. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("Lena begins to ponder... Lena finds herself drawn") dulls momentum. Final image ("shattered porcelain shards") crystallizes closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loop in final third: "competing narratives that swirled in his head like a maelstrom" immediately followed by "jumble of competing narratives." Filter-verb stack (4+ lines) in high-pressure beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty; "abrasive calm of Kael's intellect" muddles metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose artifact cascade: paraphrase loops ("traveled stillness"/"traversed vast distances"), template cadence ("As she [verb]..."), and therapy-speak labels ("sense of longing") in peak beats. Final image dulled by "beacon of hope" cliché; filter-verb stack disqualifies 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in peak beats: "synaptic plasticity" appears as jargon without integration, and final thematic echo ("beauty that could be forged") dulls closure. Strong sensory density elsewhere, but scaffold phrases ("testament to forgotten dreams") clutter momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy: "toll keeper's eyes met hers," "began to inspect." Template cadence in ascent sequence ("they worked," "they found"). Final paragraph's paraphrase loop: "catalyst for connection... preserve wonder" echoes earlier abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    Loops proliferate: "quiet bay" repeated 3x in opening, "hush/hushed" iterations become mechanical. Final beat's "deep sense of gratitude" is therapy-speak label violating "embodied emotion" rule. Template cadence in ritual sequence ("As she... As the sun... As the streetlights...") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Strong opening line undermined by closure artifacts; "hushed blaze" metaphor feels forced in peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.1)
    Loops plague key beats: "thread together fragments... piecing together narrative" followed by "thread together fragments... revealing new insights." Filter-verb stacks ("reached out," "felt," "saw," "realized") dull immediacy during revelation climax.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Filter-verb stacks plague climax ("I felt the weight," "I was consumed," "I saw")—3+ lines in high-pressure beat trigger -0.5 penalty and disallow 9+. Paraphrase loops ("endless steps"/"never-ending labyrinth") and synonym churn ("tantalizing mystery"/"fleeting glimpse of possibility") dilute momentum despite lyrical flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: 4/5 sentences during painting climax use stacked metaphors ("sea of color and sound," "dance of hope") without pattern-teaching, triggering -0.5. Paraphrase loop ("smog receded"/"din seeped back") adds -0.2, dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Rosewater dread hanging like a mist" creates mixed metaphor; "weight settling like a mantle" is scaffolded cliché. Otherwise strong propulsion, but minor figurative muddle in high-pressure thaw sequence prevents 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity ("rocky shores," "musty bowels") but "neatly inventive mind" repeats as scaffold. Final paragraph overwrites with abstract resolution ("vast expanse of possibility"). Filter-verb stack in puzzle scene ("felt," "knew," "began") dulls immediacy despite high-pressure context.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythm in opening beats, but "whispering advisor's voice" repetition (7x) creates paraphrase loops. "Repulsive allure" and "morbid curiosity" verge on stock phrasing. Final paragraph cadence shift lacks payoff density.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    "The prophet's eyes sparkled... The prophet's eyes shone" is paraphrase loop. "Restless euphony" repetition borders on thematic echo. Strong propulsion otherwise, but scaffolding dulls closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt") in final paragraphs dull immediacy. "Weight of her quest settling" is cliché, but closure image ("haunting, sunwashed dread") avoids figurative muddle. No artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful texture ("morbid perfume"), but "vibrant colors" repetition and "skeletal fingers" cliché prevent 9.0. Final line’s "small victory" slightly over-tells.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.6)
    Closure beat contains paraphrase loop: "left behind, a testament to interlaced absence" echoes earlier "testament to power of interlaced absence." Template cadence in surveyor's actions dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines) trigger -0.5 penalty; template cadence ("As she...") and synonym churn ("reclaimed stillness"/"forgotten library") obscure momentum. Abstract labels replace embodied prose in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Paraphrase loops: "transform grief into something tangible, something that could be shaped and molded" then "shape, and to mold." Template cadence in lantern descriptions ("Kaito's thoughts turned to... Kaito's lanterns..."). Final third artifacts prevent 8.0+; lyrical density obscures causal links.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.7)
    "Bleak exhilaration" and "intangibly tangible" are therapy-speak loops; geode crystal described identically twice ("clutched in her hand"). Template cadence ("As she stood... As she boarded...") dulls high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Synonym churn ("thrill of excitement" → "excitement and trepidation") and template cadence ("She entered... she set to work... she pulled out") dull momentum. "Brilliant dimness" overuse strains coherence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Template cadence in opening ("stared... pondered... sipped") dulls immediacy; "mournful sigh" wave description echoes later "sound of waves," creating paraphrase loop; otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence in opening ("stood... gazed... rested") and synonym churn ("uncommonly thoughtful"/"calm determination"). "Mist swirling like a living entity" is stock metaphor dulling immediacy in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops in "felt calm... felt resolve... felt peace" dull momentum in high-pressure beats. Otherwise strong density, but "flickering flame of faith" metaphor slightly muddles the closure image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops: "ethereal glow," "otherworldly light," "bioluminescent energy" repeat within 50 words. Filter-verb stack ("felt the weight... felt like... felt an inexplicable connection") in discovery beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty; momentum stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Filter-verb stack ("Lyra felt...") in climax dulls immediacy; "kaleidoscope of colors" strains metaphor coherence during high-stakes transformation, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold loops ("flickering with otherworldly energy... as if speaking") slightly dull propulsion; near-miss on figurative muddle in "ethereal glow" repetition during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Exquisite rhythm ("glided," "stitch together fragments") with zero loops, but "ghostly resolve" repetition in climax paragraph triggers −0.3 artifact penalty. No figurative muddle; final line recharges Tear motif with concrete propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "whispering hush" repeats identically 5x with no pattern payoff. Final third contains filter-verb stack ("felt a sense... felt a surge... felt herself drawn") triggering -0.5 penalty. Template cadence ("As she walked... As she reached...") dulls closure momentum; "ethereal glow" to "vibrancy" lacks textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting: 65%+ sentences use stacked modifiers/metaphors in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("As she...") and paraphrase loops ("darkness vanquished") in final third trigger -1.7 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    Overwriting weakens propulsion: "precognitively cursed nature stirred" (redundant), "fleeting moment of beauty borrowed from the night" (purple). Template cadence ("As the..., the herder...") loops in the rock-placing sequence, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose sings with rhythmic control ("winds howling... chorus of the damned") but overwrites key beats: "maddening vortex of sound and sense" followed by "sudden stillness" uses clichéd metaphors. Filter verbs ("she felt") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy by 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Redundant scaffolding in closure ("memory of the duel lingered... unyielding pursuit of knowledge") dilutes momentum; "dignified chaos" recurs with near-synonym phrasing ("beautiful and intense," "serene backdrop... battleground"), triggering paraphrase-loop deductions in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor scaffold: "thoughts turned to..." repetition in reflection beats. Strong specificity ("torn paper, rusty keys") but "fragments of broken dreams" slips into abstraction. Final line’s "luminous fracture" overwrites emotional complexity without legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but "mist swirled" repetition creates subtle textural redundancy. Final paragraph's "surprise fate... outrun pain... new path" exhibits template cadence. Avoids major artifacts though density slightly muddles climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.6)
    Template cadence dominates: 7+ "As she [verb]..." openings create drumbeat rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("Aria felt a surge," "she felt a sense") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, while stock phrases ("tapestry of vibrant colors") replace textural specificity. Final image lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Paraphrase loops ("emotions untangle, like threads of lace") and therapy-speak ("cerulean regret") in peak beats dull immediacy. Final third's "memory remained" cameo lacks causal pressure.
