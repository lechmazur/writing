  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "gradual change" recurs across seven paragraphs without added meaning; "intricate patterns/web/beauty/dance" cycle redundantly. Template cadence appears in multiple paragraphs starting with "Maria's thoughts/research/work." Lines often restate rather than advance: "decay was not just a destructive force, but also a creative one" immediately followed by "shaping the contours of reality through the accumulated dust patterns." Stock metaphors ("intricate dance between chaos and order") and therapy-speak ("kindled humility") dull the final third. Information density is low; many sentences do only one job (describe theme) without propelling story or character.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "sense of disorientation" / "scorched testament" / "fragility and beauty" recur without added pressure; "stillness" and "pauses" are restated across multiple beats. Template cadence runs: "She felt…she felt…she knew…she felt" stacks across the final third. Stock metaphors ("world seemed to hold its breath," "crucible") and therapy-speak labels ("discover purpose in the pauses") dull peak beats. The Text-Artifact Screen triggers −0.8 for loops touching the closure paragraph, and register drift into abstract diction (e.g., "drifting resonance of her surroundings") adds −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or major artifacts. Several sentences carry template cadence: "She had always found solace… where the outside world seemed to fade away, and the beauty of nature was preserved…" stacks clauses without propulsion. "A sense of peace," "a sense of connection," "a sense of pride" recur as abstract labels rather than embodied states. Figurative language ("ripples on a pond," "delicate flower in ice") is conventional and does not muddle, but density is moderate—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "weariness lifting, replaced by a sense of purpose" echoes "sense of purpose he hadn't felt in years." Template stems recur ("The undertaker felt," "As he…," "With each…"). Stock metaphors ("shining monument," "beacon") and synonym churn ("stillness," "peace," "rest," "solace") pad the final third. The closure beat is dulled by these artifacts, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences restate the same concept with synonym churn: "gently persistent nature to cajole and encourage," "soft murmur of agreement... gentle hum of determination." Sentence openings repeat structural patterns ("As she," "The," "For Akira"). Filter verbs ("felt a sense of pride," "knew that") dull immediacy. The final two paragraphs recapitulate the same forward-looking hope without new pressure. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 16–17 restate "unused love surfacing" and "love within" across four sentences without added detail. Template cadence: "As she [verb], she [verb]…" appears in six paragraph openings. Stock metaphors: "blossoms seemed to unfurl like tiny stars," "threshold to the infinite," "chorus of ethereal dancers." The final five paragraphs loop the same thematic claim (love within, journey to heal) with synonym churn. High density of figurative language in non-peak beats (wisteria "glow," air "vibrated," boundaries "blur") without pattern payoff. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "experience was disorienting, yet exhilarating" echoed by "exhilarating and terrifying"; "discovering the texture of time" restated as "uncover the underlying fabric of reality." Template cadence dominates the middle third (runs of "Elian felt," "Elian's mind," "Elian stood"). Stock metaphors ("lotus flower," "threshold of a new reality") and elevated register ("quaking reverie," "metaphysical odyssey") obscure rather than sharpen. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating the density and coherence checks. Sentence openings recycle "As they," "The," and "Elian" stems across consecutive lines.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The liberator's [body part] [emotion verb]" recurs across multiple beats. Abstract diction ("beacon of hope," "testament to the power of," "bright and full of possibility") replaces concrete action in peak moments. The vault infiltration and seed distribution—pivotal beats—are summarized in single sentences. Figurative language is stock: "seeds of change had been sown," "legacy just beginning." Synonym churn appears in the final paragraphs ("testament to," "reminder of") without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "sound of trust breaking" appears six times without evolving meaning; "colors and sounds" recurs in similar phrasing. Scaffold sentences stack: "The impact of memories on her work was profound," "her fascination…was more than just aesthetic." Filter verbs cluster: "felt the sound…begin to take shape," "felt a sense of satisfaction," "felt a sense of peace." Figurative language in the final third ("petals of a flower," "swirling dance," "joyful cacophony") blurs rather than sharpens. Clarity suffers from synonym churn and template cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "soft, ethereal light" recurs three times, "illuminated moments" appears four times as a label without new pressure, and "secrets" / "mystery" / "wonder" cycle without added specificity. Template cadence dominates ("With a quietly savvy air, Lumina moved…"; "With the couple now oblivious…"; "With a sense of wonder…"; "With a sense of quiet determination…"). Stock metaphors ("precision of a ghost," "press their ear against destiny's door") and elevated diction ("luminous disbelief," "threshold of reality") blur into purple prose. Information density is low—many sentences restate the same quest premise. Cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase, template stems, stock metaphor) in Q7: −1.4; cadence runs touch closure: disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs ("thawing heart" recurs six times with minimal variation; "safe zones" is restated without added detail). Template cadence: runs of "Elian's [noun]" and "As [clause], [clause]" structures flatten rhythm. Figurative language is overused without payoff: "weighty lightness," "morbid perfume," "hypnotic spell" stack metaphors that contradict or blur sense. The closure paragraph loops prior declarations ("thawing heart," "safe zones") without propulsion, and several sentences restate Elian's purpose without advancing knowledge or emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "I felt drawn to it, as if it might hold some secret" / "determined to decrypt it, to uncover the secrets that it held"; "felt a sense of purpose" / "felt a sense of trembling certainty" / "felt a sense of peace"; "firmly adaptive" repeated three times without variation. Template cadence runs dominate: "I was…," "I felt…," "I had been…" as sentence stems across the piece. Stock metaphors ("long shadows," "stars twinkled," "small, fragile existence") and therapy-speak labels ("phobia-ridden," "vulnerability is power") cluster in high-pressure beats without embodied payoff. Information density is low—many lines restate the protagonist's determination or emotional state without advancing knowledge or narrowing options. Apply cumulative artifact penalty: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock phrasing in peak beats −0.3, total −1.1 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overwriting pervades: "the air grew thick with an expectant hush, as if the very darkness itself was leaning in to listen" layers four metaphoric vehicles in one beat without advancing plot. Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 6–7 restate "the oracle spoke/wove/recounted" three times with synonym churn. Template cadence: "As she [verb]...as if..." structure repeats across seven sentences. Mixed metaphor: honey drips, currents flow, fabric reshapes, and hush vibrates within four lines, violating coherent physical logic. These artifacts cluster in the climax beats, dulling the closure image. Information density is low; scaffolding like "the oracle took a deep breath, and began" pads without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "remarkably composed" appears four times; "frozen courtyard at twilight" recurs verbatim; "second chance program" is restated in five separate beats without added detail. Template cadence dominates—runs of "As [clause], Zeta [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" structures span the piece. Synonym churn ("mystical," "otherworldly," "serene") substitutes for propulsion. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beats (final three paragraphs repeat "Zeta had found," "sense of," "testament to"), triggering the elevated Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "mistrust and secrecy melting away" / "thaw mistrust with transparency" / "city of secrecy and mistrust became a place of transparency" recur across nine sentences with no added pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]," "The registrar [verb]," "The lens [verb]") across the entire piece. Synonym churn ("sense of resolve," "sense of peace," "sense of purpose," "sense of resolution") flattens momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "testament to years of toil" / "testament to the dresser's devotion"; "knowing that the garden...knew them"; multiple paragraphs restate the dresser's devotion without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("As the seasons passed," "As the sun began to set," "As the night deepened"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed or stock ("narrative of growth," "pulse, a rhythm," "beacons in the fading light"). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap. Information density is low; many sentences paraphrase prior claims.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs are present: "Kaelin felt a sense of [X]" appears four times ("satisfaction," "awe," "wonder," "excitement"); "the laboratory's [adjective] atmosphere" recurs; "As she [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Stock metaphors cluster: "liquid fire," "fabric of reality," "veil of reality," "diamonds in the night sky." The phrase "mechanically warm hands" appears twice in similar constructions without advancing pressure. Figurative language in the climax ("kaleidoscope of colors and lights") is generic. Information density is moderate; many lines describe without advancing stakes. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally per the penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops mar momentum: "the music seemed to seep from the very walls" echoes "music and silence" redundantly; "flickered, casting" structure repeats three times; "in between spaces" and "threshold" churn the same concept. Template cadence dominates: "As she [verb]" opens five paragraphs. Stock phrases cluster in peak beats: "otherworldly glow," "haunting and sublime," "forever changed." The ending stacks summary paragraphs that restate Rachel's transformation without fresh information, triggering −1.2 cumulative in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "the weight of the swallowed truth began to reveal itself" → "As she finally grasped the truth" → "the weight of the swallowed truth would stay with her forever." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("Aria moved," "Aria felt," "As she worked"). Stock metaphors ("like a shadow taking shape," "like a landscape taking shape in the mist") appear without fresh inflection. The line "her presence smudged, like a charcoal drawing" in the final beat adds figurative density that obscures rather than sharpens the closure image, triggering the overwriting penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and atmospheric cadence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sense of drowsy alertness" / "drowsy alertness wash over them," "swallowed truth" repeated three times without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("wash over," "press in," "shiver run down spine") accumulate without fresh inflection. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense," "felt a shiver," "felt their senses") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low—many lines describe mood rather than advancing situation or choice. The final beat summarizes satisfaction instead of showing the cost or choice that earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and atmospheric, with controlled rhythm in passages like "The air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint tang of forgotten memories." However, pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn undercut momentum: "chronicle keeper" appears 20+ times, often in redundant constructions ("As the chronicle keeper pondered… the chronicle keeper felt… the chronicle keeper remained"). Template cadence is evident in repeated "As the…" and "The chronicle keeper's…" openings. Stock metaphors ("sands," "tides," "shroud") and thematic scaffolding in the final third ("testament to," "reminder that") dull the closure image. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence spread across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and no grammatical errors. However, template cadence appears in repeated stems: "As she played," "As the moon began," "As the eclipse reached," "As they packed up," "As she made her way." Paraphrase loops surface in adjacent lines: "link people to the world" / "linked him to something deeper" and "ordinary magic" recurring without reweighting. The phrase "ordinary magic" appears four times across the piece, functioning as thematic shorthand rather than evolving image. Filter verbs ("began to play," "felt a sense") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; several lines perform atmospheric work without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several passages loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "As she pondered the tapestry, Emilia's thoughts turned to the half-burned diaries" immediately followed by "With the diaries in hand, Emilia set to work" restates the same move. Stock metaphors ("scars of time," "treasure trove of secrets," "vivid imagery") recur without fresh inflection. The phrase "displaced axis" appears three times with minimal variation in context, suggesting template reliance. No major clarity breaks, but information density is low and momentum sags in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence ("The Oracle's...," "The mysterious lighthouse..."). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without payoff ("orchestrate," "transpose," "wove a tapestry," "sentinel of secrets"). Abstract nominalizations ("accidentally prophetic nature," "familiar enigma") replace concrete action. The final paragraph restates the opening's claim with synonym churn. Heavy scaffold debt and coherence issues across adjacent lines: "orchestrate the meeting, guiding the conversation by directing the flow" is three ways to say the same thing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the whispers...were loud" / "the whispers...grew louder" / "the whispers...grew louder still" repeats the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template stems: "The priest's [noun]" opens five sentences in close succession (−0.4). Synonym churn: "unravel the stillness" / "to create a sense of tension and release" / "the stillness...was beginning to unravel" cycle without advancing cause/effect (−0.3). Stock metaphors: "thread by thread," "veil of their everyday perceptions," "web of sound" (−0.3). These artifacts dull the closure image, escalating the Q7 penalty to −1.2 total and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.7)
    Patterned overwriting pervades: "the figure," "the writer," "the map" repeat as formulaic sentence stems without variation; metaphors are mixed ("chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies," "topography of memories") and stacked without grounding in concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear ("the music they sought...was not just a product of notes and melodies, but of the stillness and the symmetry" restates the atmospheric claim without new information). Stock phrases—"deep longing," "sense of purpose," "sense of resolve"—dull immediacy. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than shows, flattening momentum. Template cadence and synonym churn (satchel/shell, spire/lake) persist across beats without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "The viaduct's glow seemed to intensify" / "The viaduct's glow was fading now" / "The viaduct's glow was gone" mechanically tracks one image without propulsion. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "misty veil… shrouded" / "heavy with scent" / "ethereal glow." Template cadence dominates with runs of identical stems: "She took… She closed… She stood… She smiled." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity: "living things," "inner light," "otherworldly energy." Summary replaces scene in every pivotal beat, flattening momentum. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ and applying the −1.7 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "her world one of vibrations and silence" / "even in silence, there was music"; "enthrall the space" / "enthrall the cavern" / "enthralling the cavern"; "mirrored hush" appears three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs dominate the final third ("As the seasons turned... As the seasons continued... as the seasons turned"). Stock metaphors ("slow-moving fog," "steady heartbeat," "gentle turn") replace concrete imagery. Information density is low—most sentences restate Aria's contemplative presence without advancing situation or knowledge. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the elevated Q7 penalty and the global 9+ disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold are pervasive: "she took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand" immediately followed by another paragraph restating her focus; "the quiet courtyard at dusk had given her the solace she needed, and now she was ready" echoes earlier tranquility descriptions. Stock metaphors ("the world outside receded," "time seemed to stand still," "darkness deepened") cluster in the final third without fresh embodiment. Sentence openings repeat ("The storm recorder..." appears five times; "She..." opens multiple consecutive sentences), creating template cadence. These artifacts dull the closure beat and reduce momentum, triggering penalties under the patterned-artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "uncovering layers, revealing truths, discovering the texture of time" appears verbatim in paragraphs 9, 27, and 28; "impossible choices" in 11, 15, and 22; "patterns" and "texture of time" churn through synonyms without advancing pressure. Template cadence ("As she X, she Y") spans lines 7–9, 12, 19–20, 24. Figurative language ("passionate subtlety," "complex weave," "canvas waiting to be filled") is generic and stacked without earned payoff. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt the") cluster in high-frequency without voice motivation. Apply −1.4 cumulative for loops, template runs, and stock metaphor strings.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: "chronic hush" is restated six times with synonyms (suffocating, oppressive, lingering, reminder) without new pressure. Template cadence runs: "The violinist [verb]" and "As she [verb]" open consecutive sentences throughout. Stock metaphors: "branches like withered fingers," "stories unfolded like a rich tapestry," "stars twinkled above." The final five paragraphs recycle the same closure claim ("chronic hush...transformed," "beauty can still be found," "chronic hush...now a reminder") without adding causal detail. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally and accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "warm, golden light" / "warm, honey-like light," "emotions she had crafted" appears five times, "luminescent stones" recurs in static description without evolution. Template cadence runs appear in the final third ("The dealer's task was… / She packed… / As she stood… / The dealer's footsteps…"). Figurative language ("tapestry of feeling," "dance of molecules") is stock and does not sharpen under pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and triggering mid-band deductions in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "serendipitous connection kindled a friendship" / "their friendship blossomed" / "their friendship continued to grow" recycles the same claim across paragraphs. Scaffold sentences abound: "It turned out that," "As they continued talking," "With Sophia's help." Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments ("was drawn to," "felt a desire," "knew that") dull immediacy. Template cadence: "Lena proposed... Sophia suggested... Their ideas complemented" follows identical stems. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance. No clarity breaks, but momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "webs of kinship" appears five times; "connection" and "belong" recur with near-identical phrasing across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates the final third with summary structures ("Years went by," "became a staple," "remained a testament"). Stock metaphors ("glimmering," "shimmering," "luminescent") appear in most sentences without variation. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "borrowed chronology" / "borrowed time," "essence of eternity" / "essence of the infinite," "invisible hand" repeated, "hidden gem" / "hidden cadence" / "hidden truth." Template cadence runs through much of the piece ("She closed… she worked… she felt… she knew"). Stock metaphors ("fabric of time," "swirling vortex") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to thicken," "seemed to stand") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing plot or revealing character.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm varies naturally with paragraph length modulation and sentence openings shift. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "the conjurer's gently inventive nature" / "gently inventive minds," "secrets of the orchard" / "mysteries of the orchard," "hidden harmonies" repeated four times, "ambiguous loss" / "buried optimism" recycled without added nuance. Template cadence in the final third: "The conjurer would return... The taxidermist's glass eyes would remain... The cavern orchard remained..." (three consecutive "X would/remained" stems). Stock metaphors ("weight of ambiguous loss," "spark of understanding") dull peak beats. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.1)
    Heavy reliance on paraphrase loops ("hidden treasures" recurs five times; "shadows" and "hidden" appear in adjacent lines without added pressure) and template cadence ("The dweller's eyes..., The dweller's hands..., The dweller smiled"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "beacon," "gentle breeze," "stars." Filter-verb stacks ("began to," "seemed to") appear in mid-pressure beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The mossy trellis, once a source of comfort, had become a catalyst" echoes "The linden leaf, once a simple observation, had become a symbol" and appears three more times with minor variation. Synonym churn ("solace," "sanctuary," "guide," "catalyst," "testament") substitutes for escalation. High-pressure beats default to stock abstractions ("frazzled nerves," "wash over her," "settle within"). Paragraph-cut test fails across most beats—removing any single reflection paragraph does not alter knowledge, situation, or emotional charge. Multiple artifacts touch the closure image, triggering the −1.7 floor and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and no major loops. Information density is adequate, and the read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. However, several phrases recycle stock constructions: "mere shadow of its former self," "wild goose chase," "the weight… bearing down." The phrase "haggard awe" appears twice identically, once as a beat descriptor and once in dialogue summary. Figurative language in the final beat ("otherworldly light") tilts toward generic mysticism. No major artifact blocks closure, but cumulative minor template reliance keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentence-level clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops are evident: "brighten, illuminated by an inner light" and "forces beyond the veil / forces that wove the fabric" recycle imagery across adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in repeated "As she..." constructions. Stock metaphors ("threads of magic and wonder," "gateway to a realm") accumulate without fresh inflection. No loops directly obscure causality, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear throughout: "The archivist knew that she had to hearten... She devised a plan... Working through staggered intervals, she set up..." recycles the same stem structure across sequential beats. Synonym churn ("fragments," "pieces," "disparate elements," "mosaic") restates the collection metaphor without advancing it. The final six paragraphs loop declarations of success and symbolic meaning ("testament," "beacon," "symbol") with minimal new information. Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "rich tapestry," "resilience of the human spirit") dominate closure beats. These artifacts flatten momentum and obscure any potential final image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "The vault was a labyrinth... each one whispering secrets" / "unravel the mysteries... uncover the secrets"; "with each step" / "as she walked" / "as she turned" recur without variation. Template cadence dominates high-pressure beats ("With a deep breath, she stepped... With the phantom train ticket punch in hand, Emilia continued... With a newfound sense of purpose, Emilia walked"). Stock metaphors ("secrets unfolded like a map," "mist swirled... like a living entity") and therapy-speak interiority ("trembling certainty," "overwhelming urge") appear in peak moments. The final third summarizes the climax rather than dramatizing it, and the closing paragraph mechanically ties up every thread with declared transformation instead of image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    Syntax is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings, but information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing knowledge or choice. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "the entangled memories had been given a voice, their song now a part of the eternal symphony"; "a reminder of the hidden patterns that governed the world"; "a reminder of the memories that remained, entangled and forever connected." Stock phrases proliferate ("piqued her interest," "sense of purpose," "newfound appreciation"), and the final paragraphs stack synonyms for the same thematic claim. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to see") dull immediacy across multiple high-stakes beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "possibilities swirled…tantalizing and elusive" followed shortly by "kaleidoscope of possibilities"; "colors…danced" recurs without variation or new function. Template cadence dominates the final third: "The immortal's… / The colors… / With each step… / The cursed amulet… / As the last remnants…" Stock metaphors ("siren's song," "spark of intrigue") and filter-verb stacks ("Kael's heart…stirred," "Kael could navigate") dull immediacy. Scaffold sentences advance exposition rather than pressure, particularly in the closing sequence where multiple beats restate thematic arrival without momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "waited, the ink pot cradled in her hands" / "wait actively" / "waiting was infusing it with life" / "waited for the perfect moment" cycle the same content without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She was surrounded," "She started to think," "She looked down"). Stock metaphors ("liquefy the rigid thinking," "deathly vitality") and therapy-speak ("understanding what people truly wanted") cluster in key beats without embodied specificity. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climactic paragraph without pattern-teaching, obscuring propulsion. The orientation debt and line artifacts together disqualify high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the stationer's dedication and the forest's textures are restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the piece ("The stationer's eyes sparkled," "The stationer's pencil moved," "The stationer's footsteps"). Stock metaphors ("labyrinth of secrets," "symphony of textures") and synonym churn ("unique texture," "intricate web of histories," "fragment of the world's essence") dull specificity. Artifacts appear throughout, including in the final third, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "labyrinth...became a metaphor" is restated three times across the text; "texture of memories" appears five times without added nuance. Sentence stems recur mechanically ("The survivor's [noun]," "As the [time marker]"). Stock metaphors ("sands of time," "canvas with layers") and therapy-speak ("need to understand," "power of memories") cluster in the final third, dulling momentum. Clarity is maintained, but information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispers of the past" appears four times without variation, "gloomy cheerfulness" is repeated identically, "resonant hums" recurs in adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "She clutched... She had... She listened... She knew..." across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "the whisper of closing pages" as a spatial realm contradicts established observatory setting. Stock metaphors ("wind whipping her hair into a frenzy") and inflated diction ("cacophony of sound," "joyful torrent") without specificity. The final third is especially artifact-heavy, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.9)
    Frequent paraphrase loops and template cadence mar momentum: "Ava's dual allegiance… drove her" / "Ava's actions were not without risk, but she was driven"; "The city, after all, was more than…" / "The perpetual carnival… would continue to thrive, a testament to…"; "As the days passed" / "In the end" / "As the privatization deadline loomed." Runs of "Ava [verb], [gerund phrase]" and "The [noun], [appositive]" create drumbeat rhythm. Figurative language is sparse and conventional (beacon, spirit, heart), avoiding overwriting but also texture. Information density is low; many sentences restate stakes without advancing pressure. The paragraph-cut test fails for multiple blocks in the final third that summarize rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "stillness…almost palpable, a dawning hush that seemed to reverberate" repeats across opening and closing paragraphs; "transience of life" and "fleeting moments" recur without variation. Template cadence: "Elara's [body part] [verb]" and "a [adjective] reminder of [abstract noun]" structures dominate, creating mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("beauty…forever frozen in her photographs," "quiet reverence") reduce specificity. Register drifts into corporate abstraction ("testament to," "done justice to") that clashes with immediate scene pressure. Cumulative artifact penalty (−1.2) and disqualification from 9+ in all categories apply due to loops and templates in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "calm demeanor," "serenity," "tranquility," "contentment" recur without new pressure; "heartfelt artisan," "true artisan," "her craft" cycle through the text. Template cadence is present: "As she worked… As the anchor reached… As the sound faded…" creates a drumbeat rhythm. The figurative language often mixes or strains: mist as "living entity" then "drawn away by the ship's departure" blurs the vehicle. Sentence openings repeat ("The mist…," "The drone…," "Emilia…") and information density is low—many lines restate mood or success without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity and grammar are clean; no causality breaks. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "worrying sense of anticipation" / "sense of awe" / "sense of connection" / "sense of trepidation" recur without added pressure. The final six paragraphs loop through variants of "the journey," "the mystery," "the discovery" with little new information. Template cadence ("As she walked…," "The world was…," "Emilia felt…") runs across multiple sentences in the closing third, applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines restate stakes rather than advance them.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The rhythm grew stronger" / "footsteps weaving a complex pattern" / "pattern was not random; it was a carefully crafted sequence" restates without advancing pressure (−0.4). Template cadence in the night section: "The response was faint…a whispered promise…a hint" (−0.3). Stock metaphors ("diamonds scattered," "velvet expanse") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to stir," "sensed a stirring") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). Cumulative artifacts total −1.2 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "the lonesome splendor of her task" appears twice with synonym churn ("sense of melancholy and longing"); "touches memories" is repeated with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs dominate ("As she inhaled…," "As she worked…," "As she progressed…," "As time runs short…," "As she waited…"). Stock metaphors ("heart of the temple," "weight of her mission") and filter-verb stacks ("felt an overwhelming sense," "felt the presence," "felt a deep sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. The climax—"with a final burst of energy, Kael succeeded"—is scaffold summary, not dramatized action. Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template-cadence runs ("As he approached… As he walked… As he stood… And as he walked") appear in at least four opening positions, triggering −0.4 to −0.6. Paraphrase loops recur: "thread the labyrinth" appears three times in identical phrasing; "seeking to uncover" and "driven to uncover" in adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("specter," "whispered secret," "weight of the unknown") and filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "seemed to," "felt himself") dull immediacy in peak beats. Cumulative artifact penalty totals −1.2 in Q7; baseline 5.3 minus deductions = 4.1.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence across the piece: "The ghost bride was driven… and her actions were guided" restates motivation in adjacent clauses; "the alchemist began to weave… using the carved stone bead" loops action without new detail. Runs of "As the alchemist…" and "The ghost bride…" stems flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors ("two dark pools of water," "cauldron of transformation") blur rather than sharpen sense. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a shiver," "sensed the weight," "felt a surge") dull immediacy in peak beats. Final paragraphs recycle "mournful elation" and "resonant awakenings" without propulsion, creating a summary loop rather than closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple beats: "Aria's sewing was a form of meditation" recaps prior description without new pressure; "the labyrinth seemed to grow quieter, as if the very walls were listening" → "the air was heavy with anticipation" → "the weight of her task" all restate mood without advancing situation. Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without payoff: "threads weaving together," "fabric of solace," "tone of orchid solace," "inner radiance." Final third contains four paragraphs of summary-mode restatement ("And so, the wharf weaver's work would continue... And so, the story of Aria...") that loop conceptually. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She was warmly curious... she began to explore... she stumbled upon..." and "As she worked... As she worked... As the days turned into weeks... As she made her way... As the excavation drew to a close" create mechanical rhythm. Synonym churn: "sense of homecoming," "sense of responsibility," "sense of wonder," "sense of awe," "sense of pride," "sense of cautious enchantment" (six instances). Stock metaphors: "shiver run down her spine," "thoughts untangling like the roots." High scaffold and low information density across the final third touching closure. Apply Q7 artifact cap and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "a message in a bottle cast into the vast ocean of correspondence" echoes "journey their creation would undertake" two lines prior; "the encoded message was a puzzle" is restated as "testament to their skill and creativity." Template cadence dominates ("The ebony clipboard... seemed to glow"; "The letter... seemed to pulsate"). Figurative density in the final third (pulsating energy, futuristic nostalgia, beacon of creativity) registers as overwriting without pattern-teaching. Stock metaphors ("message in a bottle," "beacon") replace specific image. Applying patterned-artifact penalty (loops + template + figurative muddle) and Q7 disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "the embroiderer worked on" / "the embroiderer's work began to take on a life" / "the embroiderer worked on"; "secrets" recurs six times; "otherworldly energy" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence ("As the days passed," "As the autumn days shortened," "As the work neared completion," "As the embroiderer gazed," "As the flame continued") runs through seven sentences without payoff (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("threads that seemed to shimmer," "chart was alive," "key that would unlock") reduce clarity in peak beats (−0.5). The final third is heavily scaffolded with summary rather than scene propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops mar momentum: "unspoken words that lingered in the spaces between people" / "the space where an apology waits unspoken" / "unspoken apologies"; "sorrow and regret" / "regret and yearning"; "voices accompanied her steps" / "melodies lingered, a gentle accompaniment to her footsteps." Template cadence dominates: "Aria's [noun]," "The [noun] [verb]," "As she [verb]" across consecutive paragraphs. Stacked filter verbs—"began to appear," "seemed to evoke," "began to take shape," "began to dissipate"—dull immediacy in the climactic clearing scene. The final third is thick with loops, disqualifying 9+ and triggering caps.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence is pervasive: "Kael's thoughts were," "Kael felt," "As she worked," "As the mist deepened," "As the anesthetic took hold"—five "As" openers and repeated "Kael" + [verb/noun] stems across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs 13–16 restate "peace," "lotus-hearted ache," and "new meaning" without added pressure. Figurative language ("lotus-hearted," "unknot," "graft") recurs without clear pattern or payoff. Line-level momentum is dulled by synonym churn ("anxieties," "fears and hopes," "shared anxieties") and scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    Rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "she had rediscovered the lost joy" repeats the opening premise without adding pressure, and "the veil between reality and dreams" is restated twice. The final third stacks declarations—"she knew," "seemed to glow," "already planning"—that summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat. Figurative language is controlled until the ending, where "kaleidoscope," "shimmering curtain," and "haunting harmony" cluster without pattern-taught payoff, approaching density overload (−0.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and end-paragraph summary stack).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops accumulate: "certainty that came with it was beginning to feel stifling" is restated as "she had exchanged certainty for curiosity"; "the sound wave garden…was now a living, breathing entity" echoes "the mural had changed…now alive." Figurative density peaks in the climax without payoff: "swirling vortex," "tide of nested awakenings," "kaleidoscope of possibilities." Stock metaphor strings ("vibrate with otherworldly energy," "pulse with inner light") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to be pulsing," "seemed to be watching," "seemed to be smiling") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Template cadence in final third: "With a sense of…," "As she worked…," "In this state…" repeated across consecutive paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The greenhouse became... remained... stood as" in successive paragraphs restate legacy without advancing pressure. Synonym churn ("sanctuary/beacon," "testament/symbol") clusters in the final third, dulling the closure beat. Stock metaphors appear without fresh inflection: "spark of defiance burning bright," "tapestry of meaning." Filter verbs stack in high-pressure moments ("watched as the message took shape") where immediacy would serve better. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline, −1.1 for closure contamination) and paraphrase-loop check (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean and legible, with varied sentence structures and selective sensory detail. However, paraphrase loops appear: the poet's motivation is restated across multiple paragraphs ("transform turmoil," "photosynthesize pain," "transmute suffering") without added pressure, and the shell's dual nature (prison/womb, sanctuary) is summarized redundantly. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "As she sang…," "As the last notes…," "As the poet drifted…" across consecutive beats. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; some lines ("a fleeting moment of beauty, a brief respite") repeat sense within the same sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "deserted marvels" appears four times, "forgotten names" three times, "glass orchids" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("The caretaker's task was... The caretaker's task was not limited..."). Stock metaphors ("labyrinthine structure," "sands of time") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "seemed to emanate") dull immediacy. The final third repeats the opening's static tableau, flattening momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and no major loops or scaffold. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (ink well as gift and symbolic object). However, figurative language clusters without payoff: "symphonies of truth," "tangled threads of meaning," "otherworldly light," and "fabric of reality" stack metaphors that remain ornamental rather than embodied in Elara's perception under pressure. Template stems appear sparingly ("The archive, once…had become"; "With a sense of…"). No grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguity. The final paragraph's "cautious exuberance" and "promise of discovery" rely on abstract high-level phrasing rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 13–22 restate "resolve deepening," "connection," "belonging," and "peace" across adjacent lines without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates ("As the building breathed… as the volcano slumbered… as the sun dipped"). Stock metaphors ("whispers of the past," "symphony of purpose," "mantle") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hold," "felt her heart tremble") dull immediacy. Sentence openings repeat ("As she," "The chain," "Kaelin's"). Information density is low; many lines restate mood rather than advance causality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, but the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffolding. "Balance," "equilibrium," "sense of purpose," and "peace" recur across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in repetitive stems: "As she worked... As Emilia watched... As she gazed... As the dust motes swirled." The final third restates mood established earlier ("delicate balance," "sense of peace") without deepening. Information density is low; many sentences repeat thematic concepts rather than advancing situation or knowledge. Figurative language ("patchwork of truth and fabrication," "blooming withering") is coherent but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "necessary distances" recurs nine times; "thresholds" and "sacred" are restated without added meaning. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third: "I felt… I felt… I knew…" in adjacent lines. Stock phrases—"surge of determination," "sense of peace," "moment of discovery"—replace concrete embodiment. The opening and mid-story beats carry figurative language ("drifting prism," "bleeding colors") that is vivid, but the final third collapses into summary and abstraction, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "forgot place" / "forsaken place" / "forgotten place" recur across eight paragraphs; "luminous respite" is repeated verbatim seven times without reweighting; "shadowseam wonder" appears five times in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates ("As the night wore on," "As the sun rose higher," "And as they disappeared") with repetitive sentence stems. Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("began to sense," "seemed to weave," "knew that they would"). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims without advancing situation or stakes. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop penalties totaling approximately −1.7 in Q7, with additional −0.3 for pervasive filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "missing pieces of her past" / "missing pieces of her memory" / "missing pieces began to fall into place"; "cheerful gloom" appears three times as a stock phrase. Template cadence runs through multiple beats ("She had always been," "She was on a mission," "She knew that she had to"). The final third stacks summary statements ("The recollectionist felt," "She knew that she would") that narrate rather than dramatize. Figurative language is generic (waves lapping, inner light, threads of memory) and contradicts itself (how does crater glass "glow with an inner light" while being translucent?). Information density is low; many sentences restate the same wonderment without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs 7–9 cycle through variations on "chance and design," "randomness and order." Template cadence: "As he [verb]" opens six sentences. Figurative language is generic (stars as "diamonds scattered," "velvet expanse"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("felt," "knew," "seemed"). Information density is low; scaffolding dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "tranquility of the surroundings seep into her bones" → "serene and isolated haven"; "dance became a form of poetry" → "movements were infused with an obsidian grace"; multiple sentences repeat "Aria knew" or "Aria felt." Template cadence runs: "She had always been…," "And when she…," "As she…" open consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("canvas of stars," "swirling vortex") and abstraction ("essence of the universe," "sense of unity") dull momentum. The final third recycles "Aria knew" three times without new information. Apply artifact penalty −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sense of peace" / "sense of wonder" / "sense of gratitude"; "hidden patterns" / "hidden meanings" / "hidden beauty" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates with "She felt" / "She knew" / "The glazier" opening multiple consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("complex web of interconnected threads") and abstract high-level descriptors ("clear complexity") appear in nearly every paragraph without concrete grounding. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "pain he had carried" / "pain he had witnessed," "the box...had become a catalyst" / "the box...had become a symbol," "once a mysterious object" / "once a simple object." Template cadence runs in the final third with repeated "As he..." and "The..." stems. Stock metaphors ("diamonds scattered," "velvet expanse") cluster without fresh angle. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood rather than advance situation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "mysteries of the universe" / "mysteries she sought to unlock"; "soft, ethereal light" / "soft, blue light"; "sense of excitement and wonder" / "sense of peace and clarity." Template cadence clusters around "she felt," "she knew," and "as she" openers. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding in her chest," "glimmer of hope") and therapy-speak ("sense of peace and clarity") dull peak beats. The vision paragraph stacks simultaneity errors and overwriting without propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing across multiple beats trigger baseline −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 11–12 repeat "the estate was more than stone and mortar / a testament"; paragraphs 16–17 restate the cartographer's role in preservation. Template cadence runs cluster in the final third: "The cartographer's work...," "The cartographer's journey...," "As they departed..." Stock metaphors ("mind racing," "shiver run down their spine") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering the −1.7 and 9+ disallowance per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "seemed to," "a sense of," "as if" recur mechanically; multiple sentences restate the same content without added pressure (e.g., "the prism parapet seemed to come alive" / "glowing with a light that seemed almost divine"). Figurative language saturates without pattern-teaching or payoff: "borrowed heartbeat," "coded lullaby," "dusky harmony," "otherworldly light" stack decoratively in peak beats, obscuring rather than sharpening stakes. Scaffold sentences ("With a brushstroke here and a dab of color there") and stock metaphor strings ("kaleidoscope of colors," "pulsing with a light") reduce clarity and momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "began to") and synonym churn ("glimmered," "pulsed," "danced") flatten propulsion across the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "ritual significance" appears three times, "ebony clipboard" recurs without functional variation, "price of redemption" is restated across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence dominates—most sentences follow "As [X], Elian [verb]" or "The [noun] [metaphor]." Stock metaphors abound: "weight of centuries," "delicate balance," "deep currents." The final third stacks summary lines that restate closure claims without new imagery. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the cracks in the earth had become a guide, a map to the hidden waters" / "using the map drawn by the cracks in the dried riverbeds" restates without adding detail (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "The philanthropist's eyes narrowed… / The philanthropist smiled… / The philanthropist stood…" (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("a balm to her soul," "lifeblood") and thesaurus churn ("desolate landscape" / "barren expanse" / "parched earth") dull immediacy. Figurative density in low-pressure beats ("fractured grace," "echo of extinct birds") obscures rather than sharpens (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt totals approximately −1.3.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "threads that bound her" / "threads began to unravel" / "each thread that was untangled" / "last thread was untangled" recycle the same image without added pressure. Template cadence: "As she [verb]" opens five sentences, creating mechanical rhythm. Figurative density is high without payoff: "lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes," "bodily poetic," "alarming serenity" cluster in every paragraph, violating the overwriting density check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: threads are "woven around her like a shroud" yet she untangles them—shrouds are not woven nor untangled. Artifacts touch closure ("disappeared into the snowy landscape"), disallowing 9+ globally and applying the −1.7 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs (paragraphs 10–11 both cover her crafting a new show; paragraphs 21–22 both describe the dome's serene atmosphere guiding her future work). Template cadence runs through the piece with repeated "As she..." and "The [noun] seemed to..." stems. Stock metaphors appear without fresh angle: "creative juices stirring," "deep well of creativity," "ghostly sentinel." Filter verbs stack in several beats ("felt," "seemed," "knew") where immediacy would serve better. Information density is low—many sentences restate setup or satisfaction without advancing situation. The prose remains grammatically clean but lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose is grammatically clean but marred by pervasive scaffold and loops. Paraphrase chains appear throughout: "sense of peace…sense of connection…sense of pride…sense of purpose…sense of reverence…sense of resolve" (six "sense of" constructions). Synonym churn on "fragile," "ephemeral," "transient," "temporary" recurs without added meaning. Register drifts into elevated literary ("benediction," "suspended animation") without voice motivation. Template cadence in final third: "Aria felt…Aria felt…Aria knew…Aria turned." Artifacts dull closure and trigger −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "worked," "task at hand," "labor of love," "driven by" recur without added pressure. Several sentences restate mood—"sense of satisfaction," "peace and accomplishment," "closure and purpose"—across the final beats. Template cadence appears: "She had come…one that," "She had always been…their lives," "She would use…its pattern." Figurative language in most closure sentences (ethereal, snowmelt ardor, infusing) lacks functional payoff. Information density remains low; many lines repeat rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the dream sequence: "The dreamscape was a maze of reflections, where the past and the future intertwined" is restated two lines later as "the being drew closer to the truth, piecing together the fragments." Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "The air was…"; "Hindsight moved…"; "The destination was…" Stock metaphors ("dance of understood events," "veil of time") and filter stacks ("was said to preserve," "seemed") dull immediacy in peak beats. Sentence openings vary minimally across the middle third, creating a drumbeat rhythm that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "dusky harmony" appears four times; "encrypted devotion" seven times, always as a label without functional variation. Template cadence saturates the text: "The astronomer [verb]" opens seven consecutive paragraphs mid-piece. Heavy filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy in every high-pressure beat. Stock metaphors ("inner fire," "wings of… harmony") and synonym churn ("mysteries," "secrets," "enigmas") replace concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "broken cylinder pin, a reminder of the fragility of harmony" / "broken music box cylinder pin lay forgotten, a reminder"; "she pondered" / "As she pondered"; "the music box...had found a way to reappear" / "reappears when needed." Template cadence: six consecutive paragraphs in the epilogue open with noun-phrase subjects followed by linking verbs. Stock metaphors: "faint melody," "soft, golden light," "beacon of hope." Filter-verb stack in mid-scene: "felt," "knew," "began to feel" across three lines. Artifacts touch closure (final third), triggering cap and 9+ disqualification globally per artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "As [subject] [verb]" opens six sentences across the middle third, flattening rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "erasing the boundaries" is restated three times without added pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "shards of splintered light," "specter on the horizon," "ethereal glow." Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching, creating density without clarity (−0.4). The final third maintains the same looped cadence and elevated register, dulling the closure image. Information density is low: many lines restate mood rather than advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is maintained throughout with no major grammatical errors or spatial confusion. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("deciduous in nature – it withered and died when not nurtured") and template cadence in the opening ("The air was alive... a serene backdrop"). Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she believed," "she would occasionally take it out"). Stock metaphors ("taking with her a piece of Elara's heart") and thesaurus inflation ("inadvertently created a bridge") reduce line-level specificity. Information density is low in the middle third, with repeated restatements of the bridge-generational-wisdom theme.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "disquiet" is echoed in "disquiet deepened" and "brightened disquiet" without added pressure; "curious/curiosity" recurs as synonym churn. Template cadence: "The curator picked it up… The curator's thoughts were interrupted… The curator recognized it…" runs through identical sentence stems. Figurative language clusters without coherence: blossoms "like stardust," then "like stars," and the mind "unfurl[s], like a blossom opening to the sun" mixes vehicles. The final paragraph stacks abstract summary ("sense of purpose," "world of wonder and discovery," "mysteries that lay ahead") instead of concrete image, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "she had finally found the library" / "she had found something far more valuable" / "she had found her true calling." Template cadence runs throughout ("Elara was...," "Elara knew...," "Elara realized..."). The final third stacks synonym redundancies ("secrets and mysteries," "wonder and awe," "knowledge, her curiosity, and her carefully resourceful nature"). Applied −1.2 for patterned artifacts including loops in the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is consistent and grammar clean, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "As she... Lyra..." sentence stems recur across beats. Stock metaphors ("shiver run down her spine," "thrill of excitement") flatten peak moments. The emerald card "seemed to be glowing" and stories "began to take on a life of their own" rely on weak constructions and passive hedging. Information density is low—several sentences restate Lyra's proximity to the Garden without advancing knowledge or tactic. No figurative muddle, but propulsion stalls in the middle third with repetitive summary of fragmented stories.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "translate confusion into clarity" / "her motivation to translate confusion into clarity" / "driving her to explore the mysteries further." Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "As she looked around... As she watched... As they worked... As Emilia reached out... As she descended... As she settled back." Filter-verb stacks ("felt a surge," "felt her own motivation," "felt a sense of clarity") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("threads of knowledge," "web of knowledge") replace concrete images. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the closure sequence, triggering −1.4 baseline plus −0.3 for closure contamination = −1.7 total in Q7, and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with purposeful sentence variety in the opening beats. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "the mapkeeper's task," "the mapkeeper's method," "the mapkeeper's thoughts," "the mapkeeper's surroundings," and repeated sentence stems ("As she worked," "As she studied," "As she stood") create template cadence. The final third recycles thematic content across multiple paragraphs without advancing knowledge or pressure. Figurative language ("storm of vibrations," "threads of vibration and resonance") leans generic in peak moments. Information density is moderate, but scaffolding and redundancy dull momentum, especially in the extended resolution. Loop and template penalties apply: baseline −0.8 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "seeking/searching," "glinting/twinkling," "stillness/silence/hush," and repetitive "seemed to" constructions (five instances). Template cadence runs through opening stems: "The custodian felt... They had always... Now, as they... With the shard..." across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors abound ("diamonds scattered across velvet," "burst into bloom"). Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood or concept without advancing situation. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline −1.0 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings; artifacts do not touch closure directly but pervade the middle third, capping high-band eligibility per the global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, but paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: the archivist's task is restated three times without new pressure ("to sculpt her identity," "her own identity begin to take shape," "shaping the future"). Template cadence in the final third ("She descended… She closed… She examined… She stood…") flattens momentum. Elevated diction ("forecourt," "mantle," "sublime") is consistent but not purposefully varied. No figurative muddle, but density and propulsion lag in the back half.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "her chants growing softer, more contemplative" / "her chants grew softer, but her mind was ablaze"; "lifted by the simple yet profound message" / "grateful for the serendipitous discovery"; "blooming fortress" recurs six times without evolved meaning. Template cadence runs: "As she…," "With…," "Through…" open many paragraphs. Stock metaphors (canvas, spark, gravity of hopelessness) stack without fresh vehicle. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure beat, flattening propulsion. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive loops and template artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: paragraphs 6–8 restate "transition period" and "underlying rhythms" without advancing pressure; paragraphs 26–28 cycle through "texture of time" and "mysteries" redundantly. Template cadence: "She thought about...She considered...As she sat..." creates mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "thread in the fabric") and abstract placeholders ("deeper understanding," "sense of unity") replace concrete imagery. Filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she saw," "she felt") dull immediacy across multiple high-importance beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    Syntax varies and information density is generally high, but several beats loop conceptually: "The child's claustrophobia had not vanished, but it was no longer the dominant force" is immediately paraphrased by "the gilded hush had worked its subtle magic," then revisited in "Eli felt a sense of peace, a stretching of their previously contracted world." Template stems recur ("The child's...," "Eli's...," "The...") across adjacent paragraphs without rhythmic variety. Stock metaphors—"seeds taking root in fertile soil," "gateway to a vast, inner landscape"—appear in the climactic middle without fresh specificity. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags under redundancy in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 4/8/16/21 restate the mission to "teach silence how to comfort" with synonym churn. Template stems dominate: "As she [verb]" runs across six sentences, creating mechanical rhythm. The storm glass vial is described three times in near-identical phrasing ("swirling," "hypnotic," "mesmerizing liquid"). Register drifts into academic prose ("catalyze," "manifestation," "inherent beauty") that flattens momentum. Cumulative artifact debt triggers −1.4 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "whispers of the past" / "forgotten grandeur," "renewed determination" / "weight of her quest," "unclaimed throne" recycled five times without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the opening third ("Aria was wisely adventurous, and she knew…" / "she knew that she had to…"). Stock metaphors abound: "nature's own cathedral," "like a beacon," "coursing through her veins." The closing triad ("The lore keeper had become… / the unclaimed was now claimed / whispers… replaced by…") stacks summary rather than advancing image. Accumulated artifacts exceed −1.4, and proximity to closure triggers the −1.7 range and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the keeper's decision to isolate," "their path was not one of destruction, but of careful pruning," "to allow the sanctuary to flourish in its isolation" all restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "The keeper's touch was gentle... their actions were always calculated... their path was not one of destruction" follows identical stems. Stock metaphors ("phoenix from the ashes," "slumbering giant," "dark tentacles") cluster without fresh inflection. Applying −1.2 for loops, template stems, and stock strings touching multiple beats. Figurative density in the final third ("ethereal light," "testament to tender care") lacks grounding and dulls the closure image, adding −0.5. Total deductions approach −1.7, capping this category and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "strange, glitchy text messages" becomes "cryptic" then "glitchy text messages" again within a few lines; "virtuously mischievous grin" recurs unchanged; "shadowseam wonder" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence runs appear ("As she worked… As she looked around… As Lyra walked"). The closure beat is dulled by scaffold phrasing ("She slipped… feeling its weight as a reminder"). Figurative language is sparse but the prose lacks propulsion—information density is low, with beats restating rather than advancing. Apply artifact penalties (−1.4 cumulative for loops, template stems, and closure contamination).

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: multiple paragraphs restate the same idea (e.g., "the dynasty ender felt," "the dynasty ender's," "the dynasty ender knew" across 8+ sentence openings). Stock metaphors ("bridge of intuition," "symphony of insight," "crucible of insight") appear without fresh inflection. The final third consists almost entirely of summary scaffold ("In the years to come," "would become," "would be remembered"), which touches the closure zone. Apply −1.7 in Q7 for artifact spread plus closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "mystical energies" / "mystical atmosphere" / "mystical experimentation"; "shiver ran down their spine" / "shivering bliss"; "murmured allegiance" repeated across six paragraphs without variation. Template cadence appears in runs: "The knight's eyes…," "The knight's voice…," "The knight's fingers…," "The knight's withdrawn nature…" across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("ripple like the surface of a pond," "river," "beacon") and elevated diction ("coalesce," "transcended," "crescendo") clash with the limited interiority. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap (−1.5 for two distinct issues: loops + template stems) is applied within Q7, lowering from a base ~6.2 to 4.7.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.7)
    Template cadence artifacts pervade: "Emilia's [noun]..." opens multiple paragraphs; "The [noun], once [adjective], had become [noun]" recurs. Stock phrases cluster: "a chance to rediscover," "her sense of purpose grew," "the power of unknown histories to transform and redeem." Paraphrase loop in the final third restates sanctuary/remembrance/hope across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative language ("beacon," "tapestry," "flower in the stillness") stacks without fresh vehicle logic. Clarity holds but density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold: "revised histories" recurs five times with synonym churn; "resistance/rebel/defiance" cycles without added detail. Template cadence in the final third: "As she spoke… As they dispersed… And as the first light…" Figurative language stacks without pattern payoff ("beacon," "canvas," "tapestry" metaphors for memory/history blur together). Stock phrases dominate peak beats: "hold the line," "reclaim their narratives," "weave a new narrative." Orientation completes by ~15%, but clarity at closure is dulled by repetitive phrasing. Artifacts touch the ending (−1.7 guideline).

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the mist swirls," "mist begins to clear," "mist begins to creep back," "mist swirls on" recycle the same image without added pressure. Synonym churn affects key motifs: "vested hush" appears three times, "quietly vivid" twice, "radiant grotto" four times, each repetition paraphrasing rather than deepening. Template cadence: "The saxophonist's [noun] is [adjective]" and "As [event], [result]" structures repeat across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high ("tendrils of fog curling," "ethereal fingers," "haunting resonance") but metaphors do not cohere or intensify—they ornament without propulsion. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, churn, and template runs; the artifacts touch multiple beats including the quasi-closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 escalation and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the arbor was a place of eerie beauty" / "a mystical, otherworldly place"; "she would never be the same again" / "forever changed by the experience." Template cadence runs through multiple sentences: "As she [verb], the [noun] [verb]" appears six times. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection: "whispered secret," "air of mystery," "fragile, fleeting thing." Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid without purple excess. However, paraphrase loops appear frequently: "Elian felt a sense of calm" / "Elian felt a sense of clarity" / "Elian felt a sense of pride"; "the sound of the waterfall" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: "As he picked it up," "As he worked," "As he made his way," "As the device whirred." Figurative language ("river" for path, "ashes of his past") is generic rather than character-particular. Information density is moderate; pivotal beats (device creation, closure) are summarized rather than shown, reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "journey" appears five times, "redemption" and variants four times, often restating the same concept across adjacent sentences. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "As she turned...," "As the days passed...," "As the weeks turned...." Figurative language clusters without payoff ("luminous regret," "crucible," "kintsugi intentions"). Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering −1.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "The collector's eyes locked onto the tooth… the collector listened intently… the collector reached out… the collector smiled… the collector felt… the collector's presence… the collector's footsteps… the collector's motivation." Filter-verb stacks cluster in the second half ("felt," "learned," "listened," "turned to pursue"). Figurative language is sparse but some metaphors are stock ("mist swirled," "balm," "beacon of hope"). Information density is low; many sentences restate the frame ("the collector guided souls," "the gorge was quiet") without adding new pressure. The final third repeats the opening mood without reweighting it, and the crocodile's tooth is "forgotten" in a tell rather than shown through an image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    Template cadence appears in the forest sequence: "Elara felt... She recalled... Elara's proprioceptively enhanced senses... She was getting close, she could feel it" (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "The memories came flooding back as she recalled the pain" immediately after "trauma responses were still there" restates without advancing pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor: "screamed in protest," "pulsed with otherworldly energy." Sentence openings repeat "Elara's" and "She" across adjacent lines, creating mechanical rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Clarity is intact, but propulsion sags in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "elusively tangible" appears five times; "eternal instant" four times; "anchors of intuition" recurs without reweighting. Adjacent sentences restate ("the secrets of the anchors… the role that the lighthouse lens fragment played in their unfolding" then "began to unravel the mystery of the anchors"). Template cadence dominates the final third: "Lena felt… Lena knew… Lena felt… she knew…" across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("heart afire," "beacon that shone bright") and abstract nominalizations ("the essence of the unknown," "the boundless expanse of possibility") replace concrete action. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the ghosts, too, seem to be watching her" / "The ghosts grow more distinct" / "Ezra feels the ghosts fading" cycles without adding pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She approaches… She's always been… She wonders…"). Stock phrases accumulate: "the weight of forgotten dreams," "whispers of the past," "the scent of decay," "frozen in time." The phrase "weightless burden" is repeated twice in the final third without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("seems to," "feels the") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across multiple beats trigger −1.2 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for touching the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the library was home to the cryptic letterpress operator, a figure shrouded in mystery" restates itself, and multiple paragraphs recycle "rustling awakenings" and "compress eternity into a moment" without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("As the operator… / As the prints… / As the final print…"). Stock metaphors ("the very fabric of reality," "map to the infinite") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to be," "seemed to take on") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure paragraph is summary-heavy with no propulsive syntax or concrete image to anchor cost. Information density is low; many sentences advance atmosphere without altering situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies and sentences are generally clear, but several paraphrase loops and synonym chains dull density: "to reimagine, to rewrite…to uncover," "to reimagine, to recreate, and to rediscover," "the burnished sorrow" recurs without new embodiment. Template cadence appears in strings like "As she turned…As she stood…As she made her way…As she worked…As the storm…" Filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she felt," "she knew") cluster without pressure gain. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and information density, especially in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically controlled. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "the resonance chamber seemed to vibrate in approval, its whispers weaving into a soft, approving murmur" restates "vibrate in approval" and "approving" within one line. Figurative density is high throughout without escalation at peak beats ("a tear in the fabric of silence," "tether the very essence of sound"), creating a steady elevated register that flattens propulsion. Information density is moderate; several lines rephrase stakes ("mend what wasn't torn," "restore the essence") without advancing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "stillness and scent," "soothing melody, a resonant hush," "unsettling and exhilarating," "mysteries she had been seeking." Template cadence runs through the middle third ("As she walked… As she approached… As she stood… As she walked further"). Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("she felt a shiver," "she felt herself becoming," "she felt the presence"). Mixed metaphors appear ("lotus flower" unfolding secrets in a limestone lagoon) and figurative density in the final paragraphs ("fabric of reality bending," "becoming one with the lagoon") obscures rather than sharpens. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "intricate web of connections...timewoven alliances...hidden patterns and connections" restate the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in multiple "As she [verb]" and "Aria felt" stems. Stock metaphors ("creative energies surging," "deep current of meaning") and abstract phrasing ("ephemeral creations," "otherworldly glow") dull immediacy. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the walk away. Apply Q7 cap and 9+ disqualification per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent paragraphs: "The postcards, once a source of inspiration, now seemed to hold a deeper significance" / "The postcards, now a treasured keepsake, remained scattered around her." Template cadence ("As Luna…," "As the…," "As she…") runs through multiple paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("began to discern," "began to take on," "began to see") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Figurative density ("wrapped around her," "seeping into her very being") without pattern payoff. Cumulative artifact penalty (−1.4) and final-third presence disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths are purposeful. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or character position. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cryptic messages had led her on a winding path, one that had ultimately brought her" restates arrival twice, and "secrets waiting to be unlocked... secrets it held... secrets that had been hidden" cycles the core term without added pressure. Register remains consistent; no mixed metaphors. Proofreading is clean. The scaffold cost (−0.4 for loops) and moderate density prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant paraphrase loops pervade: "contemplation…pondered," "vision began to take shape…narrative unfolding," "took a deep breath…began to work" immediately followed by "set to work." Template cadence runs cluster in the opening and closing thirds: "The alchemist's [noun] [verb]" appears six times. Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy: "seemed to shift," "seemed to be watching," "seemed to grow brighter." Stock metaphors ("born from the ashes," "canvas waiting to be filled") reduce freshness. Information density is low—many sentences restate contemplation without advancing knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the emotional patterns they were archiving seemed to be shifting" / "emotional patterns continued to pulse"; "sense of wonder, mixed with trepidation" / "sense of trepidation"; "the garden seemed to be holding its breath" / "waiting for the prophecy to unfold." Template cadence runs through the middle third ("As they…," "The scribe's…," "As the…"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "gentle stream," "soothing melody," "soft, golden glow." Information density is low; many sentences restate mood rather than advance situation or knowledge. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "she knew that the time had come" / "she knew that she was now a part"; "feeling the weight...settle" / "feeling a deep sense...wash over"; "the seed saver stood firm" / "the seed saver smiled." Template cadence: eleven sentences open with "The seed saver [verb]" or "She [verb]," flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors: "canopy of light," "swirling around her like a vortex" (the vortex is literal, making the simile redundant). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the visions sequence ("she saw...she saw...she felt...she realized") dulling immediacy. Cumulative line-level debt (−1.2 for loops, template stems, filter stacks) and artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "sanctuary's unique microclimate" / "subtle variations in the wind and temperature" / "tracking microclimate variations" recur without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs through repeated "As she…" and "Ember would…" stems across multiple sentences (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("symphony of sound," "dance between wind, sound, and silence") and elevated diction ("benediction," "solstice hush") cluster in the final third without voice-motivated grounding (−0.3). Cumulative artifact debt (−1.2) and proximity to closure trigger the global 9+ disqualification. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere more than story.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "flourishing stillness" appears in lines 5, 16, 20, and 24; "strength in vulnerability" in lines 8, 13, 22, and 26. Template cadence runs: "As the night wore on… As they returned… As the first light… As they departed…" (lines 8, 12, 19, 22). Figurative language is stacked without pattern-teaching: "cosmic janitor," "celestial ballet," "diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse," "primal elegance" cluster densely in high-concept beats. Sentence openings recycle "The janitor's…" across six paragraphs. Density penalty: figurative language in most sentences without payoff triggers −0.5; paraphrase loops add −0.6; template cadence adds −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is grammatically clean. However, numerous loops and scaffolding phrases recur: "the recluse's gaze" appears four times, "the weight of the unspoken words" three times, "a testament to" twice, and synonym churn around "emerged," "began to," "as the recluse" across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff ("haunting echo," "ethereal forms undulating," "canopy of light"). Information density is moderate; many sentences rephrase mood rather than advance situation or choice. Paraphrase loops (e.g., the box's glow described twice in near-identical terms) dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "slowly revealing its secrets" / "slowly coming into focus" / "slowly revealing its secrets" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates ("The timekeeper's X," "As they Y," "The Z, once A, now B"). Stock metaphors ("heartbeat remains," "holding their breath") lack transformation. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "became aware," "knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.3)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "She was a part of the world, connected to its rhythms and its beauty" restates "connected to the very fabric of existence" from two paragraphs prior. Template cadence runs: "The poet's eyes closed… The poet rose… The poet's footsteps…" across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angles: "gentle breeze," "soothing melody," "threads of time." These artifacts dull the closure beat ("the world was new, fresh, and full of wonder"), triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-in-final-third rule. Synonym churn: "burnished hush" recurs without functional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the orchard began to transform" / "the temple orchard became a haven"; "brazen calm" appears three times; "gently systematic approach" recurs without variation. Template cadence dominates sentence openings: "The caretaker [verb]" (five instances), "As [clause]" (four instances), creating rhythmic monotony. Information density is low—long stretches restate the same content (e.g., paragraphs 10–12 loop on "legacy" and "lasting tribute"). Baseline artifact penalty −1.0 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("a reminder" × 3), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate the skeptic's philosophical pondering in synonym cycles ("mysteries of the tower" / "secrets that lay hidden within the tower's ancient stones"); paragraphs 22–23 loop the standing-at-threshold moment across multiple restatements. Template cadence runs through possessive constructions ("The skeptic's X") in seven of thirty paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle work: "bronze quiet," "chemistry of homecoming," "threshold." The final third contains heavy scaffold that restates convergence and transformation assertions rather than advancing image or action. Information density is low; most sentences describe atmosphere without altering knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "blooming" appears four times, "sweet scent of blooming flowers" recurs verbatim, and multiple sentences restate the coachman's task without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates ("As he drove... As he worked... As the coach disappeared"). Stock metaphors ("garden reborn from the ashes of a battlefield") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to absorb," "felt the harmony") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many lines repeat rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("testament to the power"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and syntax variety are solid; no major grammar errors. Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear in mid-journey beats: "Lyra felt...," "Kael felt..." chains across multiple sentences, and synonym churn for "wasteland" (cracked earth, desert of steel, desolate). Stock metaphors cluster without payoff ("kaleidoscope of rust," "wild hush," "tiny miracle"). Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional states without advancing situation ("sense of peace," "sense of being connected," "sense of purpose"). Line-level propulsion sags in the final third as reflection summarizes rather than dramatizes the ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences are present: "The observation deck...a relic of a bygone era" then "once bustling hub...now a vast, empty space" restate the same idea. Template cadence runs appear ("Aria's curiosity was piqued...Aria's thoughts turned...Aria began to sketch...Aria smiled"). Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle ("stars twinkling like diamonds" appears twice). The closure paragraph stacks summary statements that dull momentum. These artifacts pervade the final third, triggering the cross-category cap.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is clean and grammatical but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "As they gazed… Moonwhisper's thoughts turned…" / "As they ventured… the air grew…" / "As the last piece… a shiver ran…" / "As they made… the icebound crystals…" Pattern persists across seven beats without variation, triggering −0.6 for template-stem runs. Figurative language is frequent but generic (swirling mists, golden light, endless canvas) and the climactic swap is told rather than shown. Information density is low; many sentences restate without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the void left by the missing leader" / "void that needed to be filled"; "silence was broken" / "eerie silence"; "luminous absence" repeated without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "She had always been…" / "She proposed…" / "She realized…" Stock metaphors ("thread weaving together," "tapestry of meaning") muddle without clarity. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to echo," "seemed to be coalescing," "seemed to amplify," "seemed to fade") dull immediacy across high-density paragraphs, triggering −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "ancient tomes and mysterious artifacts" / "dusty tomes and forgotten knowledge"; "deep understanding" / "deep and abiding motivation"; three uses of "sense of" in close proximity. Template cadence: "It was said that... And it was this understanding that... And so, with... And when the magic... And in the silence..." Stock metaphors ("danced like restless spirits," "threads of forgotten memories") clutter peak beats. Figurative density obscures propulsion without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence runs pervade: "As he fidgeted...," "As the tutor worked...," "As he walked...," "As he navigated...," "As he emerged..." across seven sentences triggers −0.6. Paraphrase loops: "woven hush" appears in paragraph 2, 13, and 25 without reweighted meaning; "fierce repose" in paragraphs 16 and 27. Stock metaphors: "weight of his guilt slowly lifting, like the ebbing of a tide" is clichéd. Filter-verb stacks are minimal. Information density is low—many lines rephrase the journey without advancing pressure. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraphs repeat "woven hush," "fierce repose") triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disqualification.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "echoes" appears eight times, "mist" fourteen times, "truth" nine times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same claim. Template cadence runs pervade ("The mist would...," "The artist's..."). Stock metaphors ("river," "veil," "monument") and therapy-speak ("forged hush," "emotional aftereffect") clutter peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") dull immediacy. These artifacts trigger −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "secrets she uncovered" / "uncovering the hidden patterns," "kintsugi intentions" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Template cadence in the final third: "As she... / As the... / And as she..." across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative language ("dire enchantment," "quilted together") is stock and repeated. The breath-hold clock creates propulsion, but scaffold phrases ("it seemed," "she knew") pad key beats and dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "sense of peace" appears three times, "temporary eternity" four times, "intimately aloof" twice; adjacent sentences restate theme without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the ending: "The quay painter's legacy...a testament...the power of art...to convey the beauty." Stock metaphors ("mind ablaze," "brushstrokes danced," "world melted away") cluster without fresh vehicle. Figurative density in closure paragraphs (four consecutive sentences with metaphor or elevated diction) obscures rather than sharpens the final image. Sentence openings vary minimally in the final third; four paragraphs begin with subject-verb declarations about the painter or her art.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "vibrations of intent" recurs six times with minimal variation; "screaming tenderness" appears twice in identical phrasing; "gentle, insistent voice" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "Elian felt…," "Elian stood…," "Elian knew…" across five consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("vortex," "beacon of hope," "fabric of reality") cluster in the ritual sequence without fresh specificity. These artifacts dull the closure image ("world was full of hidden harmonies") and trigger cumulative penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock strings −0.4, touching closure adds −0.3 for total −1.6 baseline; the spread disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence pervades: "She had lost…she found," "The navigator's eyes…The navigator's own," "As the moon…so too did," "It was…but the navigator," "The journey was…but she pressed." Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 12–14 (map-building, resilience, determination restated). Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense," "knew that," "began to") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors: "open wound," "beacon," "lifeline." Figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff. Apply template-cadence, paraphrase-loop, and filter-stack penalties totaling approximately −1.5.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.9)
    Sentence openings are varied and rhythm supports mood. Heavy paraphrase loops: "fractured grace" appears twice in nearly identical phrasing, "cultivate psychological safety" recurs without reweighting, and the empathy-virus premise is restated multiple times across paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle third: "As they [verb]" and "Their [noun]" stems repeat. Stock metaphors ("tangled undergrowth," "storm clouds gathering") and therapy-speak ("trauma," "psychological safety," "emotional scars") flatten peak beats. Clarity is maintained but information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "lost in thought" recurs three times; "mist swirled" / "mist...swirling" / "mist continued to swirl" across adjacent paragraphs; "witnessed isolation" is named twice in quick succession. Template cadence runs appear ("As the stranger stood... Kael began... He noticed..."). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere rather than doing double duty with character or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The chip… seemed to glimmer" / "now shone with a new light" / "glimmered in the fading light" / "glimmered softly in the darkness." Template cadence runs across adjacent paragraphs: "As she [verb]… As the [noun]… As the [noun]…" Stock metaphors ("heart swelled," "weight lifting") and therapy-speak ("sense of connection," "sense of peace," "sense of wonder") dull closure beats. Deduction baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs; escalated to −1.2 because artifacts touch the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences pervade: "sense of trepidation... sense of purpose... sense of foreboding... sense of wonder... sense of determination... sense of curiosity... sense of purpose" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates with "The queen felt..." and "It was as if..." stems recycled without variation. Stock metaphors abound: "sea of clouds," "shimmering expanse of silk," "living, breathing entity," "shadows... writhe and twist." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "gazed") dull immediacy throughout. The closure beat—"a truth that was both wondrous, and terrible"—is the weakest line, reducing potential cost to abstract summary. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings (−0.4), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (−0.5) = baseline −2.0 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "secrets" and "hidden patterns" recur across adjacent lines; "sense of wonder and curiosity" / "sense of connection" / "sense of satisfaction" stack without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She was…," "She had…," "As she…"). Stock metaphors ("eyes shone," "spark of inspiration," "quietly confident hands") and therapy-speak ("scientifically romantic intensity") flatten texture. Multiple artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering artifact penalty escalation (−1.7 baseline in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "The feral nostalgia that had driven me to start writing still lingered, but it was no longer a source of pain. Instead, it had become a catalyst" repeats prior content without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs ("I was," "I felt," "I knew") dominate adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors ("maelstrom," "kaleidoscope," "spark that had set my imagination ablaze") cluster without fresh vehicle. Synonym churn ("exhilarated," "exhilarating," "exhausted but exhilarated") within tight proximity. These artifacts touch the final third, triggering −1.0 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and paragraph rhythm varies, but paraphrase loops and thematic restatements pervade: "unveiling the ordinary miracles" and variations recur across four paragraphs without added pressure; "trembling calm" appears three times as atmosphere rather than action. Template cadence in reflection beats ("It was a skill she had honed," "It was as if the very atmosphere") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized," "knew") dull immediacy. The final third restates the opening's mood without propulsion. Loop penalty (−0.6) and template runs (−0.4) apply; closure beat also touched by restatement triggers higher penalty band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is grammatically clean. However, scaffold and loops are pervasive: "stillness" appears nine times, "tranquility" recurs, and adjacent sentences paraphrase ("The tranquility of the scene was a testament… Kaito felt a deep sense of satisfaction"). Template openings ("As Kaito…," "As he…") and abstract intensifiers ("faint," "deep," "overwhelming") accumulate without added pressure. The closure paragraph stacks summary moves ("a tiny, serene world," "the memory… etched into his mind like the runes") that dull propulsion. Deduction: −1.0 for loops, scaffold, and synonym churn across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "imperfect miracles" recurs across four paragraphs without evolving pressure; "the air seemed to vibrate / start to vibrate" and "hush before the orchard's trees were cut down" (repeated verbatim) are synonym-churn artifacts. Template cadence runs appear ("That's when she spotted it," "As she did so," "As she finished"). Stock metaphors ("river," "tapestry," "sentinels") stack without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a pang," "felt the air," "felt a sense") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Cumulative artifact penalty (−1.4) plus closure-scene touch (−0.3) disallows 9+ globally and caps this category at mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the witness had done her work" / "Aria's unwavering dedication to her task" / "the end of history witness remained" recycle the same claim across six lines. Template cadence dominates the middle third with "As she [verb]" openings. Stock metaphors ("dance upon the walls," "beacon in the darkness") and therapy-speak abstraction ("clarity she sought," "cosmic harmony") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the −0.3 to −0.7 overwriting penalty. These artifacts touch the closure paragraphs, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "clocks were more than just timekeeping devices; they were a gateway," then "secrets waiting to be unlocked," then "essence of time" recycle the same claim without advancement (−0.6). Template cadence: "The shepherd's [noun]" opens multiple beats. Figurative language ("razor edges," "grand symphony") lacks vehicle coherence and reads ornamental. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but several passages exhibit paraphrase loops and synonym churn—"casting a misty gloom" / "casting a soothing melody," repeated references to the lantern's "soft glow" and "gentle light" without new pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent "she began to" / "she felt" / "she realized" constructions. Stock metaphors ("beacon guiding her journey") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a") dull immediacy in key beats. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts; the closure beat itself is not obscured, preventing heavier penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "The operator cherished… as they worked… As the operator worked"; "a sound that seemed… a sound that was"; "knew that they were… knew that they had." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a sense") dull immediacy in several beats. Figurative language ("threads," "tapestry," "nexus," "dance") clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting. The final third contains scaffold sentences that restate prior content ("For in the world of…" explicates what has been shown), triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "preserve the weight of small moments" appears in six distinct sentences, often rephrased without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She + past-tense verb" opener across seven paragraphs) flatten rhythm. Stock phrases ("pure joy," "sense of connection," "poignant reminder") replace specific perception. The summary tail ("Years later... As the years passed...") recycles the same conceptual content across multiple paragraphs, triggering −1.2 for loops and template cadence that touch the closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the middle third: "people coming together to share their own stories and struggles" is immediately restated as "the crowd grew more animated, their desperation and despair slowly giving way to a sense of community," then again as "people from all walks of life coming together to share food, shelter, and companionship." Template cadence runs cluster in the final third ("They were bound by," "They knew that," "And Raven"). Stock metaphors ("gentle virus," "skeletal fingers," "weight of their own loneliness begin to lift") appear in most high-pressure beats without fresh vehicle logic. Synonym churn ("elusive," "desperately jocular," "politely anarchic") labels traits without embodying them. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean and fluent, but suffers from pervasive scaffold and template cadence: runs of "The mapmaker's [noun]" openings, synonym loops ("quiet blaze" appears three times without reweighting), and paraphrase redundancy (paragraph 12 restates paragraph 11's convergence theme). Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching or payoff—"canvas of intricate tattoos," "fabric of reality vibrate," "symphony of sounds and scents"—creating texture that stalls momentum rather than advancing it. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without progressing situation or choice. The final third remains artifact-heavy, disqualifying 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "strange comfort" appears three times, "editing history" recurs without added pressure, "gravitational anomaly" is restated in five paragraphs. Template cadence runs through middle third ("The pen, once…"; "The seeds, meant to…"; "The task was not just…"). Stock metaphors cluster: "fabric of space-time," "spider's web," "thresh meaning from experience." Filter-verb stack in penultimate paragraph ("felt a connection," "felt a surge," "found a strange comfort") dulls immediacy. Clarity survives but density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance action.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "translate silence into music" / "give voice to the unheard" / "symphony of silence" / "music of the moment"; "luminous harbor by moonlight" recurs without evolution. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The advisor" or "As the [X]." Stock metaphors: "map of emotions," "bridge between worlds," "fabric of the moment." Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats: "seemed to," "began to," "became clear." These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger cumulative penalty: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total reduction ~−1.3 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat so the disallow-9+ rule applies globally.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "one that had driven Elian," "one that spoke to the very heart," "one that only Elian could hear" recycle syntax without adding pressure. Template cadence dominates the middle: "With each new piece... As the days passed... As the final piece." Stock metaphors clutter peak beats: "heart still ablaze," "whispers of the past," "canopy of light in the dark expanse." Sentence openings repeat ("The," "As," "With") across consecutive paragraphs. Clarity is adequate but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance. The final third stacks summary sentences that could each be cut without information loss.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies and sentences mostly advance atmosphere and action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The auric lagoon's glow had dimmed, but its light still lingered" near the end echoes "glow on the horizon… light a reminder" two paragraphs later; "continue to drum on" / "drumming on" / "rhythm of the drumming" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Aria's [noun]" or "The [noun]." Some filter-verb stacks ("seemed to be calling," "felt a deep sense," "felt a pang") dull immediacy in key beats. Figurative language is present but mostly clear; no major metaphor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "carrying the key and the coin with her, and the knowledge" restates the prior material without advancing it. Template cadence runs through several mid-section beats: "She picked it up… She tucked… She turned…" with identical stems. "As she walked" opens two sentences in close proximity. Figurative language in the storm description is vivid but occasionally mixed: "chorus of restless spirits" anthropomorphizes wind without grounding the vehicle. Density is moderate; many lines do single work. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "stillwater tension" appears five times; "silent empathy" recurs without new pressure; "unreadable" and variants cycle through adjacent beats. Template cadence ("The guardian's eyes…," "The figure…," "As the…") dominates sentence openings, creating drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors ("glistened like a still pond," "otherworldly light") and therapy-speak labels ("spiralingly calm") dull specificity. Figurative density in the final third ("testament," "intricate," "palpable") obscures rather than charges the closure image. Multiple artifacts touch the ending, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whispers of the unspoken" repeats across beats; "sense of purpose" and "quiet determination" are restated without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("As he studied...As he sat...As the night deepened") stack identical sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("forests of second thoughts," "beacon of hope") lack fresh synthesis. The final third recycles thematic labels ("amplified quiet," "humble rebellion") in adjacent paragraphs, flattening momentum. Figurative language density ("magnetic grotto," "cobalt library shrouded in mist," "hush where past meets prophecy") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty of −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is mostly clean and flows smoothly, with varied sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. However, template cadence appears in clusters: "As she worked," "As she swam," "As she walked away" recur across paragraphs. Figurative language is dense—"lotus blooming in the darkness," "siren's song," "worn skin"—without always advancing concrete action. Paraphrase loops are present: "unlocks guarded hearts" in paragraph 4 echoes "heart unlock, its guarded depths revealed" in paragraph 15, and "detach" recurs in paragraphs 7 and 14 without added pressure. The final third stacks these artifacts, dulling the closure image's immediacy. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding like "In this moment" and "In this newfound state" pads transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally high with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph rhythm. However, paraphrase loops appear: "blank-faced performer" / "blank facade," "cultivate lightness in grief" / "cultivating lightness in grief," and repeated thematic summaries about the bouquet and turbines weaken density. Template cadence in several paragraphs ("As they worked...," "As the days passed...," "As the seasons passed...") creates a drumbeat effect. The final third stacks summary statements ("The farmhouse would remain," "Echo's eyes...seemed to hold") that reiterate rather than advance. Information density is moderate; many lines restate mood without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "boundaries she had once thought sacred" / "stride through boundaries once thought sacred" / "boundaries that had once seemed so rigid"; "tremor of certainty" appears three times with identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates—"the air was heavy," "the world around her," "with a sense of"—without variation. Figurative language stacks without payoff: "lantern-moth hush," "canvas of white silk," "river breaking its banks." These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure beat, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.7)
    Clarity remains adequate; no grammar breaks or pronoun confusion. However, pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "began to awaken…As he worked…continued to awaken…And as he worked" in adjacent paragraphs; "The painter…the painter…the painter" stems repeat without variation. Stock phrasing ("eyes lighting up," "mesmerized," "dance in the gentle breeze") clusters in key beats. Figurative language ("seemed to sing a silent melody," "seemed to whisper") recurs without earned specificity. Template cadence and synonym churn (courtyard/hub, beauty/beautiful) across the middle third trigger −0.8 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "connection" appears seven times, "laboratory" nine times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same idea ("journey to discover the texture of connection" / "artificial pilgrimage" / "journey of self-discovery"). Template cadence runs stack "As the..." and "The bell ringer..." openers across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("warm breeze on a summer's day," "soft focus lens") appear without transformation. Information density is low; many sentences could be cut without loss (e.g., "However, to meet the word count, we will stop here and conclude" explicitly admits padding). The final meta-comment about word count is a scaffold artifact that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence throughout: "The mourning jewelry maker's [abstract noun]" appears six times; "seemed to" and "appeared to" cluster heavily in key beats; adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure (e.g., the two paragraphs describing the curtains' glow repeat the same observation). Stock metaphors ("raging fire," "soft, warm glow") and therapy-speak labels ("turmoil," "sorrow," "grief") replace concrete embodiment. Information density is low; many sentences advance neither plot, character, nor atmosphere but instead paraphrase prior content. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence runs −0.6, filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, capped at −2.0 total per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, yields baseline ~6.9 minus cumulative −2.0 = 4.9.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template-cadence penalty: multiple paragraphs open with "As the..." and "With..." creating drumbeat rhythm. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines (e.g., paragraphs restating the inherited mystery, the measuring tape as symbol, the cartomancer's purpose). Stock metaphors ("threshold to a deeper understanding," "beacon that would guide her back") and synonym churn for "mystery" and "patterns" dull momentum. The piece reads as scaffolded summary rather than propulsive scene. Deduct −0.8 in Q7 for pervasive loops and template cadence; additional −0.3 for stock phrasing in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "pursuit of forbidden knowledge" appears three times, "anguished joy" four times, "atoms of nostalgia" four times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third: "The historian's work was done… The lost civilization archive… As the saffron-veil historian departed… The memory of the bronze prism pagoda…" (four successive declarative stems). Stock metaphors ("river meandering through the landscape of her soul") and generic intensifiers ("forever changed," "irrevocably altered") replace concrete action. Per the artifact penalty pack, these patterns disallow 9+ globally and trigger baseline −1.0 in Q7; artifacts appear in the closure beat, escalating to −1.7 total.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "the dusk noticer felt…," "she knew…," "she felt…" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraphs: "She rose… She moved… She walked… She felt… She knew…" across six consecutive beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: a shadow "seeping" yet "spreading tendrils" and "feeding" blurs vehicle logic (−0.4). Stock phrases ("sense of peace," "weight of her task") dull specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "shimmering stillness" appears six times, "quietly vivid" thrice, "by shedding layers" and variants recur without added meaning. Template cadence runs across the text—"As [subject] [verb]" opens eight sentences. Stock metaphors ("river flowing through a landscape," "sculpture taking shape from marble") clutter peak reflective beats without fresh specificity. Figurative density in most paragraphs creates rhythmic monotony and blurs sense. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap ceiling is reached; multiple distinct pattern artifacts push the score below 5.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold stems: "Elian's journey was far from over, but they knew that they had taken the first step" recaps the prior beat without new pressure. Template cadence in opening paragraphs ("As the anesthesia wore off…"; "As they descended…"; "As they worked…") creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("boundless sea," "whisper secrets," "meteor hush") cluster without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the final third (ethereal fingers, electric possibility, pulse with otherworldly energy) blurs sense without clarifying the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secrets hidden" / "hidden truth" / "secrets now a part" / "secrets that had been uncovered"; "enduring power of love" appears three times with minor variation; "testament to" repeats. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open "The crystal gazer [verb]" or "As they [verb]." Stock metaphor strings: "autumn leaves on a gusty day," "hush before thunder," "mournful sigh." Figurative density in the vision beat (letters swirling, melody coalescing, atmosphere thickening) obscures causal linkage without pattern-teaching. Information density is low; many lines restate situation rather than advance it. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("secrets now a part of their own story," "love that would continue to resonate").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "moonstruck dreamer...entranced," "delicately adjusted...with reverence," "mysteries hidden within the stars" restated as "hidden patterns and connections." Template cadence runs through the piece ("As she...," "With each...," "As the..."). Stock metaphors ("like the ebbing of a tide," "like mist evaporating") and therapy-speak ("freed from its long captivity") flatten key moments. Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy throughout. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same atmospheric claim without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.9)
    Rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates, but paraphrase loops appear: "The archive, a large, ornate box, was occasionally everywhere" is restated as "its presence felt throughout," and "her essence merging with the dune" echoes "Asa's form began to blur" without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence clusters in the middle third: "As she walked… As the night deepened… As the first light" (−0.5). Stock metaphor "kaleidoscope of color and sound" and "testament to" (twice) reduce specificity. The opening and closing lines function, but the closure beat is dulled by scaffold ("ready to continue her journey"), pushing total deductions to −0.9 and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn throughout: "The hum of insight grew louder" / "The hum of insight remained"; "trees seemed to fade" / "trees seemed to be watching"; "sound of wind through different trees" recurs four times without functional variation. Template cadence dominates: "The philosopher + past-tense verb" stems open most sentences. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "began to") stack without voice motivation. Line-level artifacts pervade and dull momentum (−1.0 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact penalty pack).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening structure, avoiding monotony, but information density is low: many lines restate mood without advancing plot or character ("the air grew thick with an expectant hush" / "the silence was a balm to their souls"). Mild paraphrase loops appear—"veiled ridgeway" recurs six times, "gentle persistence" twice, "unused courage" three times—without evolving meaning. Figurative language is conventional ("unwound like a serpent," "beacon of hope") and stock metaphors ("weight of their quest") reduce specificity. No major artifact obscures causality, but the prose lacks propulsion and the closure beat ("mist began to clear") is a cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "silence" recurs in near-synonymous constructions across a dozen lines without added pressure; "cost of safety" and "frostbitten hope" are repeated formulaically. Template cadence runs appear in the final third: "They thought about… And they wondered… The bellhop's gaze fell… As the hours ticked by…" four consecutive paragraph openings follow similar stems. Stock metaphors ("heavy blanket that suffocated," "spark of connection," "monument to the power of silence") cluster without fresh embodiment. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "wondered about," "saw the discoloration") dull immediacy in high-reflection beats. Applying the Text Artifact Screen: baseline −1.0 for loops/stems, −0.4 for stock strings, total −1.4 in Q7; the artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "cryptic messages" restated across five paragraphs without new detail, "patient work" and "slow accumulation" echoed, and the ending recaps "diminutive titan" and "iron gall ink pellet" in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: "As the constellations…, Kael worked…" / "As the days turned…, Kael's presence…" / "As the darkness…, Kael's heart…" in three successive paragraphs. Figurative language is stock ("like two glittering stars," "gentle rustle of leaves"). Information density is low; many sentences restate the same concept. Apply −1.4 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for figurative clichés at peak beats, totaling −1.7 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "The paths that disappeared" restated across paragraphs; "rhythm/rhythms" echoed without escalation; "secrets" and "whisper" recur as placeholders. Template cadence runs: "As she [verb]... As the [noun]... As the stars..." in the final third. Stock phrasing pervades peak beats: "newfound sense of purpose," "spirit soar," "beacon in the darkness." Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed") dulls immediacy in key moments. Cumulative artifact debt and momentum drag lower the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose carries rhythmic variation and vivid phrases ("margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity"), but paraphrase loops pervade: "reignite the spark...rediscover the purpose," "reignite the rebellion...rekindle the fire," "renewed sense of purpose...renewed spirit." Template cadence appears in repeated structures ("As she...the stars"; "The stargazer's...still"). These artifacts dull momentum at closure ("walked on, awkwardly confident, into the unknown" recycles the opening trait without fresh pressure). Density and propulsion suffer under synonym churn, triggering −0.8 for loop spread and −0.3 for template runs in Q7, with the −1.7 artifact-at-closure deduction applied and global 9+ disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "secrets she needed to uncover lay hidden here, waiting to be unearthed" echoes across beats. Template cadence appears in repeated "As she [verb]" openers and stacked filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "seemed to shimmer," "seemed to grow"). Figurative density in every sentence ("tendrils of consciousness," "lotus blooming," "ancient power") without pattern-teaching or payoff creates ornamental texture. The final third compounds these artifacts, triggering the global 9+ disallowance and reducing information density. Clarity remains intact, preventing deeper penalty routing to Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, with varied sentence structure supporting contemplative rhythm. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("branding iron," "withered fingers," "endless expanse of blue-gray silk," "beacon of light") that inflate texture without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops recur: "stillness" is asserted multiple times across adjacent paragraphs without new detail, and the photograph's transformation is repeated conceptually. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in high-density passages. Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional state rather than compounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured and disjointed" / "shattered and useless," "labyrinth, a maze," "whispers of ancient tomes" appears three times. Template cadence: "The artist's..." opens five sentences in close succession. Stock metaphors ("threads of reality," "river," "beacon") and therapy-speak ("luminescent ache," "necessary darkness") cluster in peak beats without fresh vehicle. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure zone (final third), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.7)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the world around them dissolving into a sea of uncertainty" followed by "bond forged in the fire of curiosity and discovery" recycles abstraction without advancing knowledge. Template cadence in the opening: "scanned… searching… moved… darting." Stock constructions dominate peak beats: "eyes narrowed," "eyes locked," "world seemed to expand." Figurative language is generic ("sea of uncertainty," "fire of curiosity") and contradictory (fire/sea). Rhythm is uniform; no sentence-level propulsion. Closure is softened by stacked abstractions rather than a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The letter, now transmitted, carried on the digital winds" restates the prior beat's content without added pressure. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines ("outrage and curiosity" / "murmurs of a present reborn"). Template cadence runs through the final third: "Aria's actions had scandalized... she had given voice... she had set in motion." Stock metaphors ("digital winds," "catalyst for change") and therapy-speak labels ("bravely conflicted heart," "sense of pride and trepidation") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy and reducing information density.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "tranquility she sought to cultivate" / "tranquility she had found" / "the tranquility of the glass-domed enclosure"; "sense of purpose" / "new sense of purpose" / "sense of belonging." Template cadence: seven consecutive sentences in the middle third open with "Aria" or "The" + noun, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "in the end") and therapy-speak ("deep sense of purpose") dull the final third. The closure beat ("she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be") is scaffolded certainty rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the boundaries between reality and dreams were said to blur" is restated as "a place where the boundaries between reality and dreams were blurred" sixteen lines later. Template cadence runs appear throughout ("As she walked, she would occasionally stop"; "As the night wore on"; "When she finally rose"). Stock metaphor strings—"her heart sang," "her spirit renewed"—replace concrete image at closure. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she heard") dull immediacy across high-pressure beats. Figurative language in most sentences of the climax lacks coherent vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster densely: "hidden truths" appears three times, "orbits of regret" four times, and "the truth" / "uncover the truth" recur without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third with repeated "As she…" and "With…" sentence openers across eight consecutive paragraphs, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors ("web of logic," "catalyst for change," "beacon of truth") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language in most sentences of the descent sequence ("clouds swirling in tandem," "glimmer of a new path," "otherworldly light") remains decorative rather than pattern-taught. Baseline −1.2 for loops and template runs; −0.3 for filter stacks; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her own guilt began to surface" / "dissonance of old guilt had been haunting her" / "her own guilt began to lose its hold" / "feeling the weight of her guilt lift" restates the same content across four separate beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had acquired it recently" / "She had dubbed this phenomenon" / "She felt a kinship." Stock metaphors ("shimmers," "weight of the stars," "petals of a flower") cluster without fresh specificity. Information density is low; scaffolding sentences narrate process without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and thematic restatements dull momentum: "The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world" appears twice verbatim, and "emergent hush" is recycled without functional variation. Template cadence appears in multiple paragraph openings ("As she worked," "As the design reached," "As she gazed"). Stock metaphors—"tendrils of fog curling around the edges"—and elevated abstractions ("coalescing into a gentle hum") accumulate without concrete payoff. The closure beat is not obscured, but artifacts pervade the second half, triggering accumulated deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops dominate the final third: "the plaza was slowly being reborn" / "transformative power of aberrant mercy" / "new narrative...one of resilience and hope" / "memory...would no longer define the space" restate the same claim without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She stood there...and felt" / "As she stood there...Aria felt" / "And Aria...stood as a testament." Stock metaphors ("embers from a dying fire," "beacon of warmth," "glimmer of hope") and therapy-speak labels ("aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Figurative language is contradictory: "warm coldness" appears twice without clarification, and "tone that was both gentle and unyielding" mixes incompatible registers.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose carries significant paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "echoes" appears dozens of times with little functional variance, and adjacent paragraphs restate the same event (e.g., paragraphs 9–10 both say the echoes are shaping themselves). Template cadence dominates: "As [X], Echo [verb]" recurs across multiple paragraphs without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("bittersweet longing," "otherworldly energy") and scaffolding ("it seemed," "as if") dilute momentum. The text-artifact penalty (−0.9) applies; multiple loops and stems touch the closure beat. Information density is low; many sentences describe atmosphere without advancing knowledge or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is generally clear and avoids major mechanical errors, but suffers from repetitive sentence stems and summary phrasing across adjacent lines. Multiple paragraphs begin with "Luna" + verb or "The [noun] was/were" constructions, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "sense of pride and accomplishment washing over her" followed by "sense of peace settle over her" restates emotional resolution without added pressure. The piece tells emotional states ("fascinated and intimidated," "deep connection," "sense of unity") rather than showing them through action or image, reducing information density and flattening momentum in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "mysteries...hidden" → "mysteries...uncover"; "voice of the unknown" recurs without reweighting; "the journey ahead" → "guiding her forward" restates rather than advances. Template cadence runs dominate closure beats ("She was...," "Aria felt...," "The coastal cave...") without taught pattern or payoff. Stock metaphors ("tide of emotions," "labyrinth," "kaleidoscope") cluster in high-pressure moments. Figurative density ("vibrate with memories," "pulse with energy," "glow with light") blurs specificity. These artifacts touch the closure unit, triggering the tightened penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The task was not just... but to..." / "The turner's motivation was not merely... but to..." / "not a fixed destiny, but a raw possibility." Synonym churn recycles "unravel" / "unscramble" / "tangled skein" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("tapestry," "beacon," "crucible") appear in most sentences of the final third without pattern-teaching. Applying −1.4 for pervasive artifacts; final-third concentration disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "sense of peace" / "sense that she had finally found," "mist swirled around her" repeated three times, "prudently daring" stated twice in identical phrasing, "engraved pillbox" described identically in two touches. Template cadence dominates: "She + verb" structure appears in runs of three or more adjacent sentences throughout. Stock metaphors recur without fresh inflection: "silver hush," "skeletal fingers," "weight lifting." The opening and closing paragraphs echo each other structurally but without reweighting—both describe the spy standing at the bluff in mist with a "sense of" emotion. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing situation, knowledge, or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "mist swirled… a damp, gray shroud that muffled all sound" is immediately echoed by "soft lapping of the water"; "slow, deliberate precision" and "soft, soothing rhythm" recycle cadence; "fog began to clear, ever so slightly" is restated as "fog began to clear, revealing a world." Template stems cluster: "As they reached," "As he worked," "As the ferry continued," "As they reached the far shore." Stock metaphors ("like the gentle simmer of a pot," "like a drawing on tracing paper," "like a page… waiting to be revealed") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without payoff. Elevated diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift," "percolate") clashes with the coachman's working-class role. Figuration is dense but often mixed: "yarn needle… a tiny, shining thread that connected him to the task" conflates object and metaphor incoherently. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("spindrift serenity, suspended in time"), triggering the −1.7 band and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity is generally strong, with vivid images and clean grammar. However, paraphrase loops appear: "faded lantern glass" recurs without functional variance, and multiple sentences restate Akira's meditative alignment ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a subtle alignment," "felt a sense of temporal dislocation"). Template cadence is present: "As she gazed," "As she pondered," "As the sun dipped," "As chimney smoke," "As the darkness deepened" across seven paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("like the unfolding of a lotus flower") and abstract phrasing ("sharp gentleness") reduce textural specificity. Applying −0.6 for paraphrase/template runs and −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "bring light into the darkness" / "reflect light into dark corners" / "reflection of the light they had brought into the darkness." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("As they worked… As the night wore on… As the sun rose"). Stock metaphors ("weaving a spell," "wrapped in a soft blanket") and therapy-speak ("protected vulnerability") in peak beats. Deduction: −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate "brittle awakenings = fragility of existence" without added pressure; paragraphs 11, 15, 18 cycle "translate isolation into independence" with synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate: "The sundial… seemed to…" (paragraphs 4, 11, 21), "Lyra's [body part] [verb]…" (paragraphs 3, 10, 14). Stock metaphors cluster: "whispers of the past," "vast, unfolding narrative," "forging a new path." Filter-verb stacks in final third ("seemed," "felt," "began to") add −0.5 per artifact pack rule; total deduction −1.7 for artifacts touching closure. High-band entries and 9+ disallowed globally.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with no major syntax errors or loops. However, several passages feature paraphrase redundancy: "Lena's ghostwriting had allowed her to tap into the deepest desires...but she yearned to uncover the hidden patterns" restates her motivation without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("As she sat there...As the installation took shape...As the sun dipped...As the crowd dispersed") creating a drumbeat rhythm. Stock phrasing ("the thread that bound everything together," "hidden patterns of the world") recurs without fresh specificity. The final paragraph loops thematic declarations rather than propelling forward.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "cautiously hopeful" recurs as label four times; "cosmic tricksters" eight times without variation. Template cadence dominates: "The [noun], [descriptor], [past tense verb]" opens multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors proliferate: "stars twinkled like diamonds," "fabric of reality," "celestial ballet." The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes closure, and figurative language in peak beats ("ethereal grit," "resonant harmonics") reads ornamental. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disqualification from 9+ and high-band caps per Q7 penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "Lyra felt an inexplicable connection to the sound, as if it was guiding her" immediately followed by "She followed the haunting refrain"; "sense of wonder and awe, knowing that she had been forever changed" closely restates "filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment." Template cadence dominates the final third with repetitive "Lyra felt / Lyra knew / As Lyra walked" sentence openers across five consecutive paragraphs, triggering the −0.6 artifact penalty in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Stock metaphors ("siren call of the unknown," "ghostly presence") and elevated register ("tantalizing," "encompass," "crescendo") clash with the established adventure-narrative voice. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph structure modulates between dialogue and reflection. Paraphrase loops appear: "essence of her subjects" / "essence of his quest"; "sense of kinship" / "sense of connection" / "sense of clarity" / "sense of purpose." Template stems recur: "As the artist worked," "As the mist swirled," "As the portrait neared," "As they parted," "As she emerged." Clarity remains high, but density suffers from scaffold phrasing and conceptual redundancy in the final third, dulling momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "nervously confident" appears three times; "coded stanzas" recurs without variation; "reversible exile" is repeated identically. Template cadence dominates middle paragraphs ("The copper nail… seemed to be"; "Emilia's thoughts were consumed"; "As the night wore on"). Synonym churn on "mystery," "truth," "hidden patterns" without added pressure. Figurative language ("spongey dread," "fragile bubble") appears frequently but inconsistently, mixing registers. The loops and scaffold obscure momentum and dull what little escalation exists.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "weight of the unspoken began to lift, like the morning fog" is restated four times across paragraphs ("slowly lifting," "essence of their story," "trail of sound"). Template cadence dominates mid-section ("The fiddler's X…" × 6 consecutive lines). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "river of light," "beacon," "threshold to a new reality." Figurative density in final third obscures rather than charges. Synonym churn on "transform/redemption/possibility" without added pressure. Core penalty −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure beat, triggering 9+ disqualification globally.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is moderate. However, multiple paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "dusky harmony" and "polished calm" recur without functional shift; the final five paragraphs restate the same insight (paths, stories, territorial markers) with synonym churn. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in reflective beats without voice necessity. The opening and middle thirds are cleaner, but the ending's repetitive scaffold dulls closure and disqualifies 9+ globally. No major template cadence or register drift, but redundancy costs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the burdens that once seemed insurmountable become manageable" / "the weight of her task slowly lifting" / "burdens she had once carried alone now seemed more manageable" cycle the same concept across paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "She had witnessed... she would witness... she would help" and "the stars shone bright... the stars still shone bright... the stars shone bright" repeat identical stems without pressure. Filter verbs and summary constructions ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy. Figurative language ("beacon of hope," "holding out a beacon") is stock. The closure beat itself is summary ("the world seemed a little brighter") rather than a concrete image, and the repeated "shared burdens" phrasing touches it directly. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence plus −0.5 for artifacts in the final third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Text-Artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "swirling vortex…swirling orchard vortex," "warlike serenity" repeated four times, "the druid's attribute" restated identically. Template cadence runs across the middle third ("The druid approached…The druid's attribute…They reached out…The druid took a deep breath"). Stock metaphors ("branches twisted into grotesque forms…like living serpents," "air thick with…hostility") dull specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate mission or mood without advancing situation. The flesh-eating plant seed "seemed to pulsate," then "seemed to stir"—synonym churn without causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "She was purposefully curious" restates "driven to unravel," and multiple sentences begin with "As she…" or "Aria felt/knew." Stock metaphors ("cobalt hue," "veil between worlds," "otherworldly light") and therapy-speak ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") dull the final beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated descriptor. The closing paragraph recycles "hidden patterns," "secret pathways," and "boundless canvas" without new pressure. Sentence openings vary minimally, creating a drumbeat rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "began to shift" / "began to recede," "her own intentions, her own desires, and her own fears," "more pronounced, more alive." Template cadence appears in repeated "As she…" and "The idealist…" sentence stems across multiple beats. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "skeletal fingers reaching for the sky," "threads of fate." Figurative density in the spell-weaving sequence (otherworldly energy, expectant hush, pulse with fierce energy) obscures rather than clarifies what actually happens, harming the closure image. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate the final third: "stillness"/"silence," "purpose"/"sense of possibility," "past"/"memories" recur across adjacent sentences without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence runs throughout ("He would [verb]… He would [verb]…" and "The [noun] was no longer [X], but [Y]") without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closing dozen lines consist almost entirely of scaffold assertions ("with newfound resolve," "ready to face whatever came next") that restate emotional shifts rather than advancing them. Artifacts touch the closure beat. Penalty: −1.4 for spread and closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "reestablish the connection" appears six times with synonym churn ("heal the rift," "drawing closer to the truth"). Template cadence dominates ("As she...," "With each...," "As the...") across runs of four or more sentences. Stock metaphors ("mist coalescing into droplets," "thread of continuity") and therapy-speak ("sense of wonder," "deep sense of connection") dull the line. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack without voice motivation. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing knowledge or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fluidity of identity" / "migrating identities," "gentle, relentless passage of time" repeated verbatim. Template cadence dominates ("where X, the librarian Y"). Stock metaphors ("threshold," "balance between worlds") blur specificity. Figurative density ("harmonious blend," "distill the very essence") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching. The final paragraph stacks redundancies that dull the closure image. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems; disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "latent radiance" appears six times; "walls" and "dissolve" are repeated without progression. Template cadence runs: "It was a…" "It seemed…" "The pearl, it seemed…" across multiple paragraphs. Abstract phrasing ("abandoned hopes and forgotten dreams," "the deepest desires of the human heart") substitutes for concrete imagery. Stock metaphor strings ("beacon of hope in a world that often seemed too dark") dull the final beat. These artifacts obscure momentum and touch the closure image, triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.5)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: multiple sentences restate forgiveness-as-journey without added detail or pressure. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun], it seemed..." constructions and parallel "As she..." openings. Stock metaphors ("testament to," "hidden patterns," "mended and the broken") dilute specificity. The accordion's notes "linger" and "emanate from the very earth" in adjacent beats without advancing causality. Information density is low; many lines perform atmosphere without propelling story or character.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    Clarity is high and grammar clean, but density is low: many sentences restate the quest without advancing it ("determined to uncover its secrets," "felt themselves becoming a conduit," "carry the secrets...forever changed"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The dreamer's [noun]...as they [verb]" recurs across six sentences, creating a drumbeat rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but generic ("mist swirled," "whispers hung like mistletoe," "siren call") and does not accumulate pressure. Paraphrase loops in the closing paragraphs ("forever changed" appears twice, "secrets of the library" three times) dull the final image. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, low density −0.3, totaling within the −0.8 to −1.5 range for multiple issues.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles mar momentum: "transparent violin made of ice crystal" / "the violin's provenance" / "the violin's history" recur without advancement; "perforated destiny" / "threads of perforated destiny" / "threads of fate" churn concept. Template cadence runs through opening and closing thirds with identical participial structures. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate," "velvet cloak") and abstract elevations ("labyrinthine path," "mulberry ache") accumulate without payoff. Deduct −1.4 for patterned artifacts across multiple beats; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "threshold of stillness" appears six times with minimal variation; "beauty" and "radiance" recur as stock descriptors. Template cadence: "As she worked, Aria's...," "With a [adjective] [noun], Aria..." runs across multiple paragraphs. The final third stacks abstract claims—"sense of connection," "mystery that lay at the heart of all things," "unity," "hope and transcendence"—without concrete imagery. Mixed metaphor: the aurora has a "soaring melody" (auditory) that somehow infuses a gemstone (visual/tactile) through "subtle vibrations" (tactile/auditory), muddling vehicle coherence. Information density is low; many sentences restate emotional escalation without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: multiple paragraphs restate Aria's peace, the grotto's serenity, and the hairpin's significance without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence runs through the piece ("As she worked," "As the days passed," "As the seasons passed"). Stock metaphors ("rustling leaves," "soothing melody," "gentle dance") replace specific action. Figurative language like "scallop the clouds" and "vineyard hush" appears without pattern-teaching or payoff, and their meanings remain unclear. The final third amplifies these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "the conscience's mission was to unhook the cloak's grip" / "As they worked to unhook the cloak" / "the conscience finally unhooked the cloak." Template stems recur: "As they [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Stock metaphors ("web of fears," "threads of a fishing net") and therapy-speak ("suffocating certainty," "protected vulnerability") flatten key beats. The final third reprises "sincerely insincere" and "protected vulnerability" without new meaning, applying −0.8 for loops and −0.6 for filter-verb stacks and late artifacts, capping 9+ eligibility globally.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "subtle patterns"/"complex ideas," "measured tone"/"soothing quality," "understanding dawning"/"slow revelation of hidden truth." Template cadence appears in runs of "The researcher [verb]" and "The student [verb]" across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("like a flower opening to the sun") and filter-verb stacks ("could see," "seemed to," "knew that") dull immediacy in what should be peak beats. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.4)
    Heavy paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: multiple restatements of "centuries of dust," "skimmer remained steadfast," "navigation without movement." Template cadence runs ("The skimmer's X was Y" repeated six times) and stock metaphor strings ("symphony of stone and shadow," "vast expanse of the universe") pile up without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drifts into abstract academese ("multisensory awareness," "underlying structure of reality") inconsistent with the established voice. Baseline deduction −1.0 for combined artifacts; −0.4 additional because loops touch the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Eira knew that she had found what she was searching for," then "Eira knew that she would return," then "Eira was eager to continue." Synonym churn cycles through "renewed sense of purpose," "deeper understanding," "new sense of direction." The phrase "lingering luminance" appears four times, "brilliant dimness" twice, without functional variation. Stock metaphors ("spirit soar," "icy walls," "beacon of hope") cluster in closure beats. Filter-verb stacks ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a surge," "felt her spirit soar," "felt a sense of hope") dull immediacy across high-pressure moments. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, synonym churn, and filter-verb stacks in peak beats total −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat, adding −0.3. Total deduction: −1.7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    Rhythm varies adequately; no major grammar or tense breaks. However, paraphrase loops appear ("the truth hiding behind the words" / "hide behind the truth itself") and templated interiority recurs ("Kael felt," "he knew" across multiple paragraphs). The final three paragraphs stack near-identical stems and restate the discovery claim without advancing pressure. Information density is moderate; sentences often do one job rather than layering action, image, and choice. No figurative muddle, but several generic metaphors ("fabric of reality," "sea of twinkling lights") dull precision.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "the universe had contracted" / "universe's contraction," "quietly enthusiastic" / "quietly enthusiastic nature," "secrets of the universe" recycled across paragraphs. Template cadence: "The decision maker [verb]… the decision maker [verb]…" runs across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors ("diamonds against velvet," "thrill of excitement") and filter-verb stacks ("felt a thrill," "felt a sense," "seemed to twinkle") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (−0.6 paraphrase, −0.6 template cadence, −0.4 filter stacks) plus the lack of sentence-level propulsion yields this score.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "melancholy longing" / "bittersweet ache," "ancient" appears five times, "echo" / "whispers" / "voices" cycle without added meaning. Template cadence dominates mid-story: "The reaper's [noun]" x6, "As [time clause], [action]" x4. Metaphors stack without coherence: echoes "crystallize" into "misty apparitions" that are also "twisted bodies writhing." The closure paragraph summarizes rather than images, and "distant intimacy" is asserted rather than enacted in syntax or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The bell, once a mere object, had become a focal point for the mage's brittle devotion, a tangible representation of their commitment" restates prior content without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear—"The mage's [noun] turned to," "The mage's hands moved," "The mage's earnestly naive heart"—across multiple beats without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("shards of what once was," "fabric of the world," "beacon of hope") in high-concept moments reduce specificity. Figurative density in the climax paragraph (ethereal light, swelling heart, profound silence, beacon) blurs rather than sharpens the image. Cumulative artifact penalty warranted.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs restate the warden's task (documenting, healing, spinning stories) without advancing pressure, and the final third recycles "stories to be told" and "forgotten memory" across multiple lines. Template cadence dominates—"The warden's [noun] [verb]" stems recur across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors ("beauty in the brokenness," "threads of history") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "turned to") dull immediacy in what should be charged beats. Information density is low; many paragraphs could be cut without altering knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "sense of wonder" / "touch of wonder" / "heart filled with wonder"; "the orchard seemed to grow more vibrant" / "trees and flowers responding to the energy." Template cadence runs through the middle section with repeated "As she [verb]" and "The [subject], now [state]" constructions. Stock metaphors ("delicate dance," "threshold of discovery") accumulate without fresh specificity. Information density is low—many sentences restate emotional states rather than advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "revising" appears five times, "watcher's burden" three times, "patterns" and "stars" recur without accumulating new pressure. Template cadence runs ("As she worked," "As the night wore on," "With each passing moment") and stock metaphors ("diamonds scattered across velvet," "crucible, tempering her resolve") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "knew that," "felt the weight") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing immediacy and disqualifying 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "emotional numbness" appears five times, "vivify" three times without added pressure; "identity crisis" and "clone custody battle" recycle as summary. Template cadence dominates—"As he [verb], [noun] [verb]" across a dozen sentences. Figurative language is stock: "weight of uncertainty," "fire of his own inner struggle," "sense of peace settle over him" (twice). The final third is thick with scaffold ("a sense of," "seemed to") and synonym churn ("clarity and purpose," "fully alive" repeated). Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate the hourglass/era concept; paragraphs 13–14 repeat "whispers/hum" without added pressure. Template stems ("The maestro," "The household," "The leaf blower's") create drumbeat rhythm across a dozen sentences. Figurative language appears in most lines without pattern-teaching: "mournful melody," "haunting tapestry," "bittersweet beauty." Mixed metaphors: "macerated the silence" strains physical logic. Stock phrases: "shadows reigned supreme," "etched in the hearts." These artifacts dull the closure image and violate the −1.7 threshold for touching the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "mist swirled," "mist seemed to thicken," "mist began to clear," "mist continued to clear," "mist swirled around her" recur without advancing knowledge or pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("As she walked… As she waited… As the mist…") across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("ethereal tentacles," "otherworldly glow," "chorus of forgotten knowledge") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to loom," "felt a sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without propelling action. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The alchemist's eyes... gazed upon" / "The alchemist's hands moved" / "The alchemist stood back" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("held breath before a revelation," "rock against which turbulent forces... could crash") and synonym churn ("scorched earth" / "charred dreams" / "destructive fervor") reduce information density. Filter-verb stacks ("began to build," "began to weave," "began to vibrate") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.4) plus filter stacks in peak beats (−0.5); artifacts touch closure (−1.7 total, cap at 8.8 globally).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: paragraph 11 restates the message's content across three sentences without new information; "serenely electric" and "celestial signals" recur as labels without varied embodiment. Template cadence runs in paragraphs 17–19 ("As she…," "And as she…," "As she vanished…") create mechanical rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "edge of perception," "threads of every ending") cluster without fresh vehicle (−0.4). Register drift: "fantasy practicality" and "cryptic message" read as academic shorthand rather than POV-filtered perception (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty touches the closure beat (final three paragraphs), triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    Multiple paraphrase loops blur momentum: "shift and flow like the sands in the empty hourglass" appears twice in the final third; "merge parallel timelines" recurs without added meaning; "excitement and trepidation" is restated. Template cadence runs ("She knew… She felt… She was ready…") stack in the closing paragraphs. Figurative density ("spectral," "ethereal," "celestial," "cosmic") crowds the final beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the sinew thread seemed to…" appears in six beats with synonym churn ("pulse," "guide," "imbue," "vibrate," "come alive"). Template cadence runs throughout ("The architect [verb]" opens eight paragraphs). Stock metaphors cluster: "kaleidoscope," "waves on a shore," "ghostly umbilical cord," "cusp of something momentous." The final third recycles "memories began to alter" across three paragraphs without new information. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "began to") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 19–23 restate "students are ready / horizons beckon / future is bright" across five variants without new pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "As she [verb]… Lyra's [noun]" appears in six consecutive moves. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "diamonds scattered across velvet," "threshold to infinite possibilities," "launchpad for exploration." Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra's thoughts turned," "Lyra's gaze fell," "Lyra watched") dull immediacy in high-attention beats. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster densely: "tears streaming / tears flowed harder," "whispers of the past / whispers of the dead," "faint pulses / faint pulses," "mist-clad / mist swirling," and three near-identical constructions stating Aria's vocation across opening paragraphs. Template cadence runs through multiple "As she…" openers and "The woman…" stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("beacon guiding," "balm to her sorrow," "shroud") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "realized") dull high-pressure beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood without advancing situation or knowledge—and the final third summary further drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clarity is adequate; no major grammatical errors or pronoun confusion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "secrets of the undersea cables" / "secrets of the codex" / "secrets they had revealed" / "secrets waiting to be unlocked" across multiple paragraphs without added meaning. Stock phrases accumulate: "her mind racing," "felt a sense of peace," "vanished into the distance." Figurative language is sparse and conventional. Information density is low in the middle third, where reading the logbook is summarized rather than dramatized. Propulsion stalls in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose exhibits paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sense of midnight solace" / "midnight solace that soothed Akira's soul" / "midnight solace that lay just beyond"; "mysteries that lay beyond the veil" / "mysteries that lay beyond the veil" (final paragraph); "growing understanding" / "newfound understanding" / "deeper understanding." Template cadence with "As [noun] [verb]" openers across multiple paragraphs (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("fragments falling like snowflakes," "echo of a life cut short") and elevated register ("coalescing into a being of light and shadow") that blur concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Clarity is maintained, preventing steeper penalties, but momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispers of the ancients" appears six times; "patterns" nine times; "storyteller sat/watched/sought/began/continued" template cadence runs through multiple beats. The final third recycles "new language/lexicon," "echoes," "whispers," and "power" without added pressure. Figurative density is high but often generic ("symphony of movement," "threads of sound," "inner light") without vehicle coherence. Sentence openings cluster: "The storyteller's," "As the," "The [noun] seemed to." Information density is low—many lines restate the thematic claim (translation, preservation, new language) without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.7)
    Heavy phrase recycling ("frostbitten hope" appears three times; "harmony untamed" and "gravitationally playful" recur without development) and paraphrase loops ("strange occurrences"/"strange energies"/"strange and wondrous"). Template cadence in the middle third: "The herbalist led… The device crackled… As Lena picked up…" runs across multiple beats without variation (−0.5). Abstract noun stacks ("a sense of unease," "a sense of trepidation," "a sense of determination") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the ending ("frostbitten hope rising within her"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "brought back to the world" / "reawakened to its beauty" / "breaking free the beauty that was dormant" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "As she played…"; "As the music reached out…"; "As the last notes…"; "As they danced…" Figurative language saturates every sentence without variation—"weaving a spell," "like a river," "like a gentle breeze"—dulling rather than sharpening the image. Stock metaphors (stardust, golden glow) and therapy-speak ("emotional aftereffect," "renewed vitality") flatten the line. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative Q7 penalty of −1.4.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: "foster a sense of security" and "foster a sense of connection" recycle stems without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "way forward") and abstraction ("otherworldly energy," "larger narrative of redemption") pervade with no concrete anchoring. Runs of identical sentence openings ("The mailman," "As he") create template cadence (−0.5). Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("the cobalt arcade…seemed a little brighter"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with no grammar errors or spatial incoherence. However, synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear: "misting hush" recurs nine times; "gentle" appears six times; "whisper" and cognates appear seven times. Template cadence in the final third: "As the [time phrase], the [subject] [verb]…" structures repeat. Stock metaphors ("beacon of possibility," "cradle of creativity") cluster in the closing paragraphs. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or knowledge. Scaffold sentences like "Their work resumed" and "The day wore on" pad transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "stories...were not just recollections, but living, breathing entities" is restated as "the stories start to reawaken, their presence a gentle hum," then "stories, once dormant, now pulsed." Template stems recur: "As she worked..." opens three paragraphs. Figurative language stacks without accumulation: "boundaries...blurred," "entwined like branches," "scarf...seemed to glow," "shimmer," all in peak beats without payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate the librarian's project without advancing it. The closure paragraph cycles through synonyms for success without concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "capture the sunrise"/"capturing the moment," "paint with light"/"vitalize," "cipher of longing" appears six times without functional variation. Template cadence runs ("The [X] was not just [Y]; it was [Z]" repeated thrice). Figurative language is dense without payoff: "luminous absence," "hush of improbable beginnings," "fabric of the archipelago's mystique" pile up in adjacent lines. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the final paragraph, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades: "shadowed nexus under starlight, where the air was alive with the hush of cosmic possibility" stacks three metaphors in the opening line. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the unlocking) obscures action: "the air…seemed to thicken…resisting" is vague (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "task was to free this idea" / "act of freeing the trapped idea" / "enveloped secrets had been given the freedom" (−0.3). Template cadence in the locksmith's actions: "eyes scanned," "gaze followed," "eyes narrowed," "hands moving" (−0.4). Register drift into abstract philosophy ("larger symphony," "cognitive possibility") clashes with the task-focus (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat; cumulative −1.5 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "determined to find" / "determined to recover" / "determined to uncover"; "sense of resolve" echoes "sense of trepidation" and "sense of crisp nostalgia." Template cadence dominates the final third with identical "As she [verb]" and "She knew that" constructions. Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "follow the thread," "on the cusp of a discovery," "fabric of reality." Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack across high-concept beats, dulling immediacy. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn weaken momentum: "unravel its secrets and understand the geometry" / "unlock the shadow's mysteries"; "lost in thought" / "the hush wrapped around them like a shroud" restates the same atmospheric stasis. Template cadence appears in repeated "As…" and "The archivist's…" sentence stems across multiple paragraphs. Figurative language clusters without earned payoff—"combative tenderness," "topography of the soul," "fabric of reality"—elevating diction in a way that dulls rather than sharpens the beats. Stock metaphors (dust motes dancing, eyes holding sorrow) reduce specificity. These artifacts appear throughout, including near the ending, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "preserve the color of wonder" / "preserving the color of wonder"; "weave between worlds" / "weaving a new reality"; multiple restatements of transformation without added detail. Template cadence runs throughout ("As she worked... As the seed took root... As she stood there... As the sun began to set"). Stock metaphors abound ("shimmering veil," "gateway to other worlds," "fabric of reality"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, creating density without clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "interlaced hush" / "accumulated silence" / "velvety stillness" recur without added pressure; "tapestry needle glinted" appears twice; "As she worked" opens multiple beats; "restorer's art" / "restorer's craft" cycle. These loops dull momentum and occupy space without advancing causality. Stock metaphors ("balm to the spirits," "soft exhalation") and abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest," "living, breathing entity") reduce concreteness at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "secrets hidden" recurs five times; "whispered chapel" and "henge" are mechanically alternated without functional distinction. Template cadence dominates: runs of "Elara felt/knew/sought" across adjacent sentences. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "threshold," "gateway," "boundary," "edge" all describe the same metaphorical moment. Stock phrases ("hidden in plain sight" twice, "sense of wonder," "siren call") flatten texture. Information density is low; most sentences restate mood or reiterate Elara's task without advancing knowledge or choice. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carried the henge's whispers with her"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences accumulate: "I'd come to understand" echoes "I'd been drawn," "As I continued to explore" repeats the opening move, and the final three paragraphs restate the theme with synonym churn ("transformed," "shifted," "slowly begin to settle"). Template cadence: multiple "I + past verb" stems in succession. Figurative language is sparse but mixed: "darkness closing in like a shroud" and "weight of discoveries settling like snow" juxtapose without tension. Line-level clarity is adequate but density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is mostly clean and grammatically sound, but suffers from repetitive phrasing and template cadence: "seemed to" appears five times, "began to" three times, creating a passive, distanced texture. Figurative language is dense without clear payoff—"ghost in code," "tinkersong," "driftingly alert" are coined terms that accumulate without constraining action. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmospheric mood without advancing situation or knowledge. The final two paragraphs loop through summary and thematic assertion, dulling momentum at the closure beat (−0.8 in Q7 for pervasive scaffold and metaphor density that flattens the ending).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "secrets hidden," "secrets that lay hidden," "secrets that still lay hidden" across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence dominates ("As she…," "As she turned…," "As the elevator…"). Stock metaphors ("whisper secrets," "labyrinth of the writer's heart," "frozen world") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "seemed a sanctuary," "seemed to glow") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third repeats "sense of" three times in four lines, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "empty spaces remembered" and "spooled wholeness" are restated multiple times without added detail or pressure (−0.3). Sentence stems repeat: "As she..." opens three paragraphs, "Lyra's..." opens two more, creating template cadence (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("sea of clouds," "twinkling like diamonds," "heart swelled with emotion") reduce specificity in peak reflective beats (−0.3). The final third is heavily abstract ("deeper truth," "perfect clarity," "sense of peace"), and figurative language ("dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness") recurs without payoff or clarity. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood rather than advancing knowledge or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with vivid sensory anchors (musty silence, dappled shadows, worn coin). However, the piece exhibits template cadence in repeated "as they worked," "as the…" constructions, and paraphrase loops: the artist's absorption and the pre-demolition stillness are restated multiple times without added pressure. The final three paragraphs recycle "the artist," "the stillness," and "the essence" in similar syntactic frames, creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls propulsion. Filter verbs ("seemed," "as if") cluster in the closure beat, reducing immediacy when the final image needs sharpest focus. Density is moderate; many sentences do one job rather than layering character, action, and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clarity is adequate; no pronoun confusion or tense breaks. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chart the luminance's movements, creating a new map" near-duplicates "note its movements, searching for a pattern." Template cadence runs through several beats ("Eli began to note," "Eli set to work," "Eli pored over"). Stock metaphors (starlings "murmuring," light "dancing") recur without fresh inflection. Information density is low in the middle third—multiple sentences restate Eli's excitement without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear throughout: "seemed to" recurs in six sentences, and the final four paragraphs cycle through synonym variants of understanding/secrets/rhythm without advancing pressure. The phrase "Kael's eyes... seemed to absorb" and "seemed to be a part of" exemplify filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Lines like "With a sense of reverence" and "In this moment" are scaffolding that could be cut. Cumulatively these artifacts trigger a −1.0 to −1.2 penalty in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "struggles and triumphs" / "hardship...thriving community," "guidance or solace" / "wisdom," "sense of excitement and anticipation began to build" / "sense of brambled hope took hold." Template cadence runs through middle paragraphs ("As the settlers...," "As they...," "As the pathways..."). Stock metaphor "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures" and therapy-speak "sense of belonging" flatten texture. Register drifts into Wikipedia voice: "the planet's unique energy signature, which emanated from a nearby nebula." Information density is low—many sentences restate setup without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "hush" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure (paragraphs 2, 9, 14, 17, 18); "beautifully flawed" and "fragile/fragility" cycle (paragraphs 3, 4, 11, 13, 21). Template cadence: "As they…," "As the…" opens four paragraphs. Figurative language is dense ("pane of hush," "dying breath of the day," "bruised awe") but occasionally mixed (hush as pane, presence, ripple). Clarity holds; momentum sags under synonym churn and scaffolding. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems; no closure-beat artifact present, so cap remains above 5.5.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The caretaker felt a sense of pride and satisfaction" followed immediately by "feeling a sense of peace"; "sensing the change" and "sense of wonder" cluster without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs: "She had been tasked... She picked it up... She made her way... She knew that she had to complete..." Stack of similar stems flattens rhythm. Some figurative language misfires: a nut "seemed to glow" as if "proud" anthropomorphizes without charging the image. Sentence-level clarity is adequate but information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clear and grammatically clean. Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and sensory detail is woven through action. However, the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Maria felt...Maria's heart felt...Maria knew...she felt...she emerged...she walked...the sound faded...the melody lingered" across adjacent sentences restates emotional resolution without added pressure. Stock metaphors (grief "loosened its tight grip," "pieces began to fall into place") in peak beats dull specificity. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops in the closure zone per artifact pack.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    Substantial paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "sense of calm"/"sense of clarity"/"sense of connection"/"sense of belonging"/"sense of purpose" recur without advancing pressure. The phrase "it seemed" appears five times as hedge. Template cadence runs dominate the final third ("Ember felt"/"Ember knew" repeated stems). Multiple beats restate the same realization—that stories live in the library's essence—across paragraphs 14–22 without new information. Figurative language occasionally muddles: "mindfully scattered" contradicts focus, and "quantifying absence" as method never receives concrete demonstration. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence touching multiple beats including near-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clarity is high; grammar clean; no pronoun ambiguity. However, scaffold and loops pervade: "Elara's gift was both a blessing and a curse" / "remorse…lingered" / "memories…bitter" recur in paraphrase across paragraphs. Template cadence dominates transitions ("As she worked," "As she walked," "As she stood," "As she turned") appearing ≥5 times, flattening rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt the weight," "felt a sense of peace") cluster in the final third without voice justification. Information density is moderate; pivotal beats (touching pavilion, subsuming memories) are told rather than shown through sensory particulars and immediate consequence. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, filter stacks −0.5, paraphrase loops −0.3; total band ~5.7, and artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clarity is high; no causality breaks or spatial confusion. Template cadence appears: "It was here that Emilia...," "She believed that by bringing...," "As she reached...," "As the night wore on..." across multiple beats without purposeful variation. Figurative density ("symphony," "dance," "diamonds scattered," "velvet expanse") ornaments rather than advances pressure. Paraphrase loop: "hush of borrowed starlight" is repeated twice without reweighting. No scaffold or pronoun drift, but information density is low—many sentences describe atmosphere without advancing choice or knowledge. Line-level craft is competent but not propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "twisted wreckage" and "broken periscope mirror… cracked… dulled" restate decay; "inexplicable connection… entangled… fragment of her own memories" cycles the concept without added detail. Template cadence runs dominate ("As she worked… As the night wore on… And as she did so"), violating the stem-variation test across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("labyrinthine corridors," "complex web") and abstract intensifiers ("profound transformation," "otherworldly energy") replace concrete propulsion. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for loops and template stems across the text, plus −0.5 for touching the closure paragraph ("And as she did so, she knew…").

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secrets she sought" / "secrets she had uncovered" / "secrets that still lay hidden"; "latent blaze within her" recurs three times with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates ("She had been studying," "She had come to the grotto," "She knew that she would reenter"). Stock metaphor strings ("fabric of reality," "seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") appear without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph stacks redundant summary sentences that restate resolution rather than enact it. Figurative language in the opening and closing beats (serpent/seed, threshold effects, prism-minded) remains abstract decoration rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Rhythm varies and information density is acceptable, but paraphrase loops cluster in the middle: "It was a method that had served them well" immediately follows the beat it summarizes; "The silence had fallen…It was as if the very fabric…" restates the same condition across two sentences. Template cadence appears in the final third: "As the…" opens three consecutive paragraphs ("As the music flowed," "As the music continued," "As the sculptor packed"). Stock metaphors—"fabric of sound," "tapestry of sound"—appear in high-pressure beats without fresh vehicle. Line-level clarity is adequate; no major grammar or coherence breaks. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density in key beats, total −0.9 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs: "he had always been thoughtfully precise… but the isolation had given him a new perspective" restates across adjacent lines; "the world was full of mysteries" appears twice verbatim. Stock metaphors ("darkness," "beacon of hope," "journey continued") and therapy-speak ("hopeful melancholy," "sense of peace settle over him") pervade. Figurative language in most sentences without pattern or payoff: "magnetic nexus pulsed with otherworldly energy," "thoughts… intertwining with the very fabric of the universe." Scaffold includes "The silence was almost palpable, a living entity" immediately after describing silence as a method. Apply −1.2 for loops, cadence, and mixed register; additional −0.3 for stock metaphors in peak (final) beats totals −1.5, landing ~4.9.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "quiet reverence" / "gentle touch," "soft glow" / "soft hum" / "soft, ethereal light" / "soft, lunar glow," "the air was filled" appears twice. Template cadence in the final third: "As she [verb]" × 4, "The [noun]" × 3. Stock metaphors ("stars holding their breath," "fabric of reality woven anew") cluster in peak beats without earned specificity. Artifacts touch the closure image ("heart swelled with purpose"), triggering elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "She realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered, but rather something that was always present" immediately follows "Lyra felt a sense of serenity wash over her, a sense of being in harmony with the world around her." Stock metaphor strings ("the very essence of the forest," "the very fabric of reality," "the very heartbeat of the natural world") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She watched," "She knew") dull immediacy across high-pressure beats, triggering cumulative artifact penalties of −1.4 in Q7. Figurative language is dense without coherence—mixed registers and vehicles that do not integrate. The "years later" summary compresses the ending without propulsion, and scaffolding phrases ("It was said that," "As she worked") pad transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Lyra felt" opens multiple sentences, "the orchard's" recurs mechanically, and adjacent paragraphs restate the same discovery without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("ethereal fingers," "solar winds," "trail of possibility") and scaffold phrasing ("making a mental note," "sense of wonder and awe") flatten information density. The final third stacks summary beats ("She knew that she had discovered something profound...") that could be cut without loss. These artifacts measurably dull the closure image, warranting deductions near −1.0 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clarity and grammar are clean, with no major ambiguities. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear frequently: "The silence was oppressive" / "The silence of the port city seemed to press in"; "a sense of clarity" / "a sense of determination"; "a reminder that she was not just investigating a crash, but trying to understand..." / "a reminder that there was still much to be uncovered." Sentence stems recur ("The investigator felt...," "She was driven by...," "As she..."). These artifacts dull momentum at closure ("hazy precision...guiding her towards the truth...the cultivation of foresight in action" in the final paragraph). Information density is moderate; many sentences do more than one job, but scaffold repetition and synonym churn ("towering labyrinth" appears three times) reduce propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loop/stem patterns that touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sculpted hush" is restated across five paragraphs without added pressure; "wonder as essential" is claimed in three separate formulations. Template cadence dominates the final third: "Elian smiled, knowing…," "The amber music sheet…remained…," "As Elian left…," "In the stillness…," "And so…," "The memory…"—seven consecutive beats begin with subject-verb scaffolding without syntactic variation. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to hold," "sought to certify," "aimed to unfetter"). Figurative language is dense but mixed: "unfetter the sculpted hush" and "release it from the confines of the marble" contradict (hush is not confined in marble; the marble itself is the site). Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: paraphrase loops, template cadence runs, filter-verb stacks (−1.4 in Q7; −1.7 escalation because artifacts touch the closure beat). Final-third artifact disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "avalanchingly quiet" / "eerie stillness" / "canyon hush" recur as near-synonyms without reweighting meaning, and multiple paragraphs open with "The relic keeper" or "The gilded reed flute" in template cadence. Key moments are summarized rather than dramatized ("the memories flood back—the triumphs and the failures"). Stock metaphors ("vortex of sound," "fabric of reality") and elevated diction ("avalanchingly," "mystical realms") clash with the lack of concrete embodiment. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action or interiority. These artifacts pervade the closure sequence, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence throughout. Paragraph 13: "The timeframe was limited… Echo knew that they had to make the most of the time remaining" restates identical content. Paragraphs 16–19 recycle "sense of" four times in close succession ("sense of urgency," "sense of anticipation," "sense of clarity," "sense of purpose"). Stock metaphor strings: "thrill of anticipation," "swirling vortex of meaning," "beacon guiding." Register drifts into thesis-speak ("concept of transposed empathy," "underlying mathematics of emotion") mid-beat without POV anchor. Applying loop/scaffold penalties (−0.6), metaphor stack (−0.4), register drift (−0.3) totals baseline −1.3 in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of wonder and connection" / "wonder and excitement"; "the pendant's gentle hum" repeated across beats without new function; "magic that lay just beneath the surface" appears twice in near-identical form. Template cadence runs ("As she walked," "As the aurora danced," "As she crested," "As they parted," "As the aurora-lit ridgeway") stack five sentence-opening "As" clauses. Stock metaphors ("veil between the worlds," "fabric of reality," "threads of memory") and therapy-speak ("nurture," "coax," "germinate") dilute specificity. Applying patterned-artifact penalties and paraphrase-loop deductions in Q7: baseline −1.2 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings, totaling approximately −1.5.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate "patterns reveal truth" across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "The mystic…" and "As she…" open six sentences, creating syntactic monotony (−0.4). Stock metaphors: "heart of the matter," "beyond the veil," "edge of perception" (−0.3). Figurative language ("glittering crystals," "inner light," "magic") appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity (−0.5). The phrase "truthful lies" is repeated twice within three paragraphs without reweighting. Abstract diction ("profound revelation," "heightened awareness") replaces concrete action at closure (−0.3). Cumulative artifact debt touches closure: −1.7 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "raveling silence" / "silence between them" / "chasm that had grown"; "thread unwinding" / "threads intertwining" / "threads that bound together disparate elements." Template cadence runs appear ("The loom spinner's gaze fell…," "The loom spinner's fingers moved…," "The loom spinner's heart remained…"). Mixed metaphors muddle sense: "time's unraveling tapestry" recurs three times without clear vehicle logic, and "stoically sparkling" contradicts itself (stoic connotes restraint; sparkling connotes display). Register drifts into abstract corporate diction ("testimony to the power of patience," "latent sacrifice," "conceptual integrity"). These artifacts cluster in the final third, touching the closure beat and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low: many sentences restate prior content without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "transformation" recurs across six paragraphs without varied embodiment; "quietly determined" appears twice in identical phrasing; "the sound of hammering/pickaxes echoed" repeats structurally. Template cadence: "The air was filled with…" opens two beats; "As I…" and "The [noun] [past tense]…" dominate sentence stems. Stock metaphors ("phoenix from the ashes," "balm to my soul," "stood sentinel") reduce specificity. "Azure defiance" and "bartered awakenings" read as AI-pattern insertions—elevated diction with no tactile anchor. The final third summarizes future action ("we would explore," "the cycle of creation was ongoing") rather than dramatizing present pressure, flattening momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "diverse landscapes" / "ever-changing topography" / "succession of worlds" restate without added detail; "senses reeling" appears twice within six paragraphs. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "She had been…," "She had spent…," "She moved through…," "She had been haunted…" in successive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("reflection on rippling water," "kaleidoscope of images") appear without fresh inflection. The final third carries no artifacts touching closure, limiting the deduction, but density is low—many sentences repeat the same claim (she sought truth, she navigated worlds) without advancing knowledge or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rhythm is measured and lyric; sentence openings vary. However, scaffold loops appear: "The skipper felt..." recurs; "luminescent ache" is repeated verbatim across paragraphs without added meaning. Paraphrase near the end: the final two paragraphs restate the skipper's connection to the lighthouse and sea glass with synonym churn ("sense of safety," "wrapped in the warm, observant gaze," "mysteries that lay just beneath the surface"). Template-cadence check: "As he..." opens three successive beats in the final third. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. No clarity breaks, but momentum sags under repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "steer the dawn" and variants appear in seven paragraphs, often restating the same content without new detail. Template cadence dominates the final third with parallel "The [noun]" openers and "would [verb]" constructions. Stock metaphors ("beam slicing through," "shard of light," "fabric of the universe") cluster without fresh inflection. Sentence structures repeat: "As [clause], [main clause]" appears six times. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "believed") dull immediacy in peak beats. The cumulative artifact load (loops, stems, metaphor cliché) triggers −0.8 to −1.2 and disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "secrets hidden within the wing's shimmering colors" → "the wing's secrets" → "secrets of the blue morpho wing" across paragraphs with no new information. Template cadence runs appear ("Kaito's eyes never left...," "Kaito's thoughts turned...," "Kaito decided...," "Kaito felt...," "Kaito smiled...," "Kaito rose"). Stock metaphors ("moths to a flame," "heart of the mystery," "sea of wonder") and elevated diction ("insatiable curiosity," "mesmerizing...testament") blur specificity. The final third recycles "valley-mist wonder" and "iridescent caution" without evolving their meaning, triggering artifact caps.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose is grammatically clean and legible. However, extensive paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "sorrow" is restated across multiple lines without adding pressure, and the final third cycles through "mysteries," "secrets," "journey," "mundane miracles" redundantly. Template cadence dominates—many sentences open with "The worker" or "The maintenance worker" in identical stems. Figurative language ("tangled threads," "web," "tapestry") is generic and stacked without clear payoff. Information density is low; the ending summarizes theme rather than advancing action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The memory keeper felt… and she reached out," "The humming grew… and the memory keeper's voice wove," "She knew that… but she felt…" across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors ("spark that once drove its magic," "beacon of hope") and filter-verb stacks ("felt drawn," "felt the energy," "felt herself being drawn") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third repeats "continued her work," "continued to thrive," "continued efforts" without adding pressure. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clear and error-free, but heavy with paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "hiding yet connected," "staying while leaving," "physically present, yet emotionally detached" repeat the same paradox across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: "As the clock struck," "As midnight drew near," "As the first light" creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("thick with the scent," "soft whisper") and elevated diction ("unobtrusive," "enlarged tranquility") stack without adding information density. The Text Artifact Screen triggers −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across the piece, including in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clarity is adequate; grammar clean. Paraphrase loops recur: "secret tea house" appears six times, "tenuous absolution" twice in adjacent paragraphs, "again and again" echoes "return again." Sentence stems repeat ("She was," "The noticer," "As she") across most paragraphs. Figurative language is sparse but stock ("wisps of summer fog," "beacon of hope"). Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the noticer's gratitude and sense of peace without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "quartz hush" repeated without reweighting (lines 1, 13, 17, 18); "edge of oblivion" (lines 8, 17); "luminous vows" echoed across 10+ lines without evolution. Template cadence: "As she [verb]" structures dominate opening beats. Stock metaphor strings—"sentinels," "fabric of life," "mist that clung"—dull immediacy. High density of filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") in peak moments flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carried with her a piece"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clear with varied syntax, but several loops and scaffolds accumulate: "the sound of" appears three times, "curiously steadfast" twice, and the final third recycles "fragile peace/understanding" and "secrets hidden" without added pressure. The standoff paragraph stacks filter verbs ("saw a glimmer," "spoke," "never leaving") that dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; the middle vendor transaction and Shadow confrontation both advance plot, but the closing reflection paraphrases on-page events. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so −0.6 for cumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "world around her seemed to slow" / "world around her was alive"; "sense of futuristic nostalgia" / "futuristic nostalgia" repeated; "mysteries that lay just beyond" / "magic that lay just beyond." Template cadence dominates the second half ("As she…" opens five consecutive beats). Stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "shiver run down her spine") and elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "spectral light") blur momentum. Multiple lines restate Aria's role as seeker without adding pressure, and the final two paragraphs repeat closure assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences undermine momentum: "inescapable calling/callings" appears three times; "auroral sorrow" recurs as a fixed phrase without evolution; "the broken combination lock" is restated identically. Sentences in the middle third follow repetitive stems ("She recalled… She was creating… She knew…"). Metaphoric language ("auroral sorrow," "vibrations… hum in harmony with her own heartbeat") stacks without physical grounding, creating elevated register drift. The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("catalyst for her creativity," "secrets that still lay hidden") rather than closing with propulsive image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lost conversations" appears six times across adjacent paragraphs; "candor in small moments" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the middle third ("As she worked… As she read… And as she worked"). Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "shiver ran down her spine") and synonym churn ("secrets," "hidden histories," "secret narratives") dull momentum. Information density is low—sentences restate rather than advance. The scaffold and repetition touch multiple beats but do not obscure the closure assertion directly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Aria's creation was not just X, but Y" structure repeats; "symphonies of truth" appears eight times without reweighting; adjacent sentences restate concepts (e.g., "her work was done" / "the world was on the cusp" / "Aria's creation stood firm"). Elevated diction ("abiding beauty," "enduring power") clashes with any grounded POV. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge," "testament") stack without fresh specificity. Figurative density in most sentences without payoff. Information density is low: multiple paragraphs convey the same thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "inner static" appears five times without added pressure; "fragmented wholeness" is restated thrice. Template cadence dominates the middle third ("She knew that she had to act… She knew that she still had her memories… Aria knew that she had found a way"). Stock metaphors ("living, breathing entity," "testament to her dedication") appear in most paragraphs. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate Aria's peace without advancing situation or choice. The closure beat is dulled by synonym churn ("peace," "wholeness," "connection").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the courtyard's tranquility was disrupted" / "courtyard's serenity had been disrupted"; "listened intently, piecing together the fragments" / "The more she listened…she began to grasp"; "The vibrant courtyard at dawn" recurs as postcard framing without evolution. Template cadence dominates the investigation sequence: "She decided to follow… She started by asking… As she continued… She listened intently… She spent the next few days…" Stock metaphors ("trail of clues," "key to unlocking the mystery," "wash over her") dull the line-level texture. At least four distinct paraphrase and synonym loops touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn proliferate: "encode/encoding/coded" cycles across adjacent lines without added pressure; "calm defiance" and "mysterious familiarity" recur as unearned tags. Template cadence runs appear ("She felt... she felt... she knew..."). Figurative language ("intricate patterns," "complex and beautiful structure") is generic and does not advance momentum. The final third stacks these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and applying cumulative line-debt penalties (−1.2).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the lighter's perception...fluctuated mysteriously" echoed by "pockets of gravity that continued to fluctuate mysteriously"; "tangible connection" appears twice; "sense of" structures repeat ("sense of distraction," "sense of trepidation," "sense of wonder," "sense of reverence"). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The lighter [verb]" or "As the lighter [verb]." Stock metaphors ("soft glow," "gleaming silence") and abstract intensifiers ("profound shift," "overwhelming urge") dull momentum. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("felt," "seemed," "couldn't help but feel"). Information density is low; several sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.9)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops accumulate: "tranquil" and "hush" recur decoratively across multiple beats without evolving function (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "conduit for forces") and near-synonymous restatements ("smoothed the hush," "enveloped...smoothing the hush") dull momentum. Several sentences summarize the same meditative state without advancing stakes. Figurative language in high-pressure beats (releasing the wing, achieving closure) remains generic rather than sharp, and the final paragraphs loop the theme statement multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence undermine momentum: "The tutor smiled" / "The tutor nodded" / "The tutor smiled to himself" repeat across beats without variation. Stock phrases like "eyes sparkled with curiosity," "voice barely above a whisper," and "sense of wonder" flatten texture. The final third stacks these artifacts heavily, diluting the closure image. Clarity remains adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whispers… whispers… whispers" across adjacent lines; "memories… memories… recollections… memories" in successive paragraphs; "resolve… resolve… resolve" in the final third. Template cadence dominates the ending: "Lyra's story was… Lyra's heart remained… Lyra emerged… The whispering seashell half had been…" Stock metaphors ("beacon," "key," "threshold," "fire of her memories") cluster without fresh embodiment. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn degrade momentum: "faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct" recurs in varied phrasings across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure or detail. Figurative language appears densely ("pearl twilight hue," "otherworldly energy," "soft, luminous color") in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence runs ("The forger smiled... The forger left... The forger felt") span the final third. Combined artifact penalties (−1.4) and disqualification from 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "whispers"/"murmurs"/"hum" cycle without advancing meaning; "webs of intrigue" appears three times in static restatement; "reed-blown melancholy" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs with identical stems. Stock metaphors—"threads of a spider's web," "doors of perception," "key that unlocked"—appear without fresh inflection. Final paragraph nearly duplicates the opening, flattening closure momentum. Information density is low; most sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "wreckage" and "salvage" churn across a dozen lines without adding pressure; "connection" and "threads" synonym-cycle without progression. Template cadence runs dominate—"Aria's X," "The Y," "As she Z"—across 8+ consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("stars on a moonless night," "broken shell") lack fresh angles. The closure paragraph stacks five generic assertions ("mysteries," "guidance," "darkness didn't seem so overwhelming") that deflate rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy: "hidden patterns" appears five times, "hidden effort" twice, "hidden truths" once, all restating the same idea. Sentences like "She felt a sense of..." recur mechanically. The opening and closing paragraphs mirror each other without adding pressure. Figurative language (fireflies as lanterns, moon path) is clear but static. Clarity is adequate; momentum sags under repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "She followed the trail, her mind racing with possibilities" / "her eyes scanning the fragments" / "her curiosity was piqued" / "her heart pounding with excitement" recycles the same stem structure across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("sharp mind and sharper tongue," "beacon in the darkness") and generic high-level descriptors ("strange, pulsating glow," "sense of wonder and awe") replace concrete specificity. The final paragraph is pure exposition dump—"The truth, it seemed, was far more complex"—that summarizes rather than dramatizes. Artifacts touch the closure beat and appear throughout, triggering the maximum deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "pondered the mysteries" / "began to sense," "watched as the prophet's influence grew" / "saw how the prophet's words captured," "shaping a new dawn" / "shape the new dawn" / "shaped the world anew." Template cadence dominates (e.g., "As she…" x5, "The visionary…" x7). Stock metaphors ("like moths to a flame," "spreading like a wildfire") and weak nominalizations ("a sense of," "a growing sense of") dull momentum. Information density is low; many sentences restate without advancing pressure. Final-third loops and artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger the −1.7 penalty in Q7, yielding a score in the 3–4 band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.3)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "sense of purpose" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "lonesome splendor" is stated twice without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "The poet's thoughts turned... The poet's eyes... The poet's pen..." across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching—"hesitant lover," "lonely serenade," "river" of words—blurring peak beats. "Positively wistful" in paragraph four reads as unearned intensifier. Sentence openings recycle "The poet" and "As" without variation. Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence deductions totaling −0.8 in Q7; no closure-scene harm beyond summary assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn drain momentum: "seemed to vibrate… seemed to resonate… seemed to echo" across adjacent paragraphs; "deep sense of purpose… deep sense of satisfaction… deep, rich shade" recycles "deep" without added pressure. Template cadence ("As she [verb]… As the [noun]…") runs through eight sentences. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "could feel") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("soft, velvety blanket," "rich tapestry of sound") and the closing thematic echo ("fleshly ethereal world") cluster near the ending, obscuring the closure image and disqualifying 9+ globally per artifact-penalty rules.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of purpose" recurs three times, "knew that" opens multiple lines, and synonym churn cycles through "determination," "resolve," "pride and purpose" without added detail. Template cadence dominates with "The mapper [verb/felt/knew]" stems across the majority of paragraphs. Stock metaphors appear (moon as "burning silver orb," ice "stretching out like a vast, frozen sea") and figurative language stacks without propulsion ("restrained wildness stirring," "electric with anticipation"). Minimal sentence-level variety or information density; most lines restate emotional state rather than advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraphs repeat "knew," "sense of," "felt"), triggering the Q7 artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 6–7 restate "memories entangled/untangled" three times; paragraphs 14–15 cycle through "dripping water" and "reminder" phrasing. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "Maya's [noun] [verb]" appears in eight consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("weight of the past," "shedding a skin," "path to freedom") cluster without fresh vehicle. The final third stacks filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") in nearly every line, flattening momentum. Synonym churn: "watchfully calm" / "at peace" / "grounded" / "connected" rotate without advancement. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor density −0.5, filter stacks −0.4 = cumulative −1.9, plus artifacts touch closure for additional −0.3; cap at 5.9 with artifacts in final third disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops abound: "sense of peace," "vibrant hush," and "rhythmic ticking" recur without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final paragraph ("The chaplain's footsteps were lighter now… The memory of the clockwork heart remained…"). Stock phrases ("weighed heavily on his conscience," "eyes met") and elevated diction ("aptly deliberate pace," "emanate from the very atmosphere") drift from the POV's plausible lexicon. Sentence structures are uniform, with long compound constructions repeating across paragraphs. The closing run of abstract emotion summaries ("hope and renewal," "solace, and a sense of peace") stacks without concrete anchor, triggering −0.6 to −1.0 for template cadence and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence pervades: "As she examined…," "As she turned…," "As the acid sea churned…," "As the workshop evolved…" across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("steadily curious" restated; "yearning algorithm" repeated without added detail). Stock metaphors ("sharp and piercing, cutting through the complexity") and filter-verb stacks ("began to ponder," "decided to transliterate," "felt an odd sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. Synonym churn ("pioneering," "steadfast," "unyielding") substitutes for concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence openings recycle patterns: "Lena's brightly attentive eyes," "Lena's obsession," "Lena's search," "Lena knew," "Lena felt," creating template cadence across multiple beats (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "She had been investigating" / "Lena's obsession with the case grew"; "the numbers were appearing everywhere" / "The numbers continued to appear." Filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") dulling immediacy. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes ("her journey had taken her," "she had emerged transformed"), and the closure beat is buried in abstraction. Artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering disqualification from 9+ and a −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich. Sentence variety supports the meditative pace. However, artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("weighted breath before reply" appears three times; "shifting ice floes" / "shifting landscapes"), templated constructions ("The peacekeeper's [noun]" opener recurs six times), and stock metaphors ("mirrors seemed to loom like sentinels," "branches etched…like a delicate pen and ink drawing"). Figurative density in the final third (glow, pulse, sigh, whisper) risks overwriting without pattern-payoff. These issues dull momentum and trigger cumulative Q7 penalties (−0.8 for loops and templates, −0.3 for mixed/stock metaphor).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of detachment"/"observing…from outside my body"; "fragile peace"/"fragile…world"; "sound of approaching endings" recurs four times without evolving. Template cadence: "I felt…I felt…I knew…I was" across the final third. Stock metaphors: "thread that might lead me back," "capacity for resilience." Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines) dull propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secrets and stories" recurs five times without added meaning; "destined mismatches" appears six times in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: "As the sun dipped," "As night descended," "As the stars twinkled," "As the hours passed" stack opener patterns. Stock metaphors ("dance of growth," "mosaic of microclimates") and therapy-speak ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") appear in peak reflective beats without concrete anchoring, reducing immediacy and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sense of stillness," "sense of peace," "sense of reverence," "sense of confidence" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs with "The line walker felt/knew" stems recurring mechanically. Stock metaphors ("gentle breeze," "inner light") and scaffold sentences ("The air was heavy") appear without propulsion. Figurative language is stacked in peak beats without coherence (e.g., "whisperfield calm," "echo of wisdom," "conjured clearing" as unearned abstractions). Multiple artifact types trigger baseline −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    Clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but the prose loops extensively: "sense of peace settle over her" appears twice; "beautiful and wondrous place," "transmute pain," and "collective healing" recur as summary assertions. Template cadence dominates the final third ("As she…," "The vines continued…," "Luna's photographs would…"), and scaffold phrases ("the dove gray map case," "the rusted factory ruins") are restated without variation. Figurative language is stock ("nothing short of magical," "testament to the power of art") and the final paragraph stacks thematic claims instead of advancing image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks create visual cadence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the silence was oppressive, a suspended hush" repeats the same idea; "their task was to decode the pattern" is restated multiple times without new pressure. Stock phrases include "red-rimmed from lack of sleep," "eerie glow," "quiet resolve." The crystal's "sonically reflective surface" is repeated across three beats without evolving function, a template cadence trigger. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; the final third bears these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "locate…searching for…found what she was searching for" cycles three times; "sound of growing older" appears in five separate beats without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs appear ("The prophet's…" opens four consecutive paragraphs in the middle third). Stock metaphors ("ethereal fingers," "heartbeat that echoed") dull immediacy. These artifacts do not break causality but measurably flatten momentum and dull the closure image, triggering baseline −0.8 in Q7. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same longing without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "clock hand that wouldn't stop spinning" / "changelessly constant in its motion"; "luminous ache" appears twice as an ornamental label; "harness the ephemeral, to capture the fleeting moments" restates the same idea. Template cadence runs appear: "Eli's days were spent... and his nights gazing" / "Eli's work was done, but the journey was far from over. / He would continue to restructure." The metaphor "gateway to the infinite" in the final third reads as stock spiritual language. Several sentences exist only to restate what precedes them without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "scent of hope" appears seven times with minimal variation; "flawless goodbye" recurs as label; "soft," "gentle," "pulsing stillness" cycle through adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: runs of "Lena [verb]" and "Emma's eyes [verb]" across multiple sentences without taught pattern. Stock metaphors: "soft rustle of leaves," "warm, golden light." Figurative density in the music-therapy passages (humming "from the mundane itself," "soundscape of gentle sounds") muddles rather than clarifies. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, where "remained" and "continued" loop thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: paragraphs restate the same content across adjacent lines ("clockwork automaton key...a tool...a metaphor...a symbol...a constant reminder"). Template cadence runs dominate—nine consecutive paragraphs open with "Lyra" or "The" + noun + "was/had." Stock metaphors ("sands of time," "canvas," "diamonds in the sky") appear without fresh angle. Information density is low—most sentences summarize rather than advance. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for loops and stems touching multiple beats, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts appear in the final third. This disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose is grammatically correct and legible, but suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "felt a sense of wonder" / "sense of clarity emerge" / "sense of purpose begin to take shape" / "sense of excitement" / "sense of purpose and direction." Sentence openings repeat ("Emilia's eyes," "Emilia felt," "Emilia's thoughts," "Emilia's mind," "Emilia felt"). Filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("felt," "began to feel," "felt herself becoming") without voice motivation. The final third intensifies these patterns rather than tightening, and the closure image ("seemed to glow") is hedged rather than direct. Information density is low; many sentences restate emotional trajectory without advancing situation or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "soft luminescence" recurs without variation, "pearl of stillness" is repeated across multiple paragraphs without evolving meaning, and conceptual redundancy appears in adjacent lines ("tranquility"/"peace"/"stillness"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("As the wheel whirred… As the mist swirled… As the moments passed"). Figurative language appears in most sentences without causal work ("bubbles rising," "crucible," "vessel," "beacon," "symphony"), creating density without propulsion. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("felt a sense," "seemed to embody," "began to shine"). The Text-Artifact penalty applies: loops and scaffold obscure escalation and dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Aria felt a sense of…," "Aria knew…," "The world outside might be chaotic, but…" The final two paragraphs restate the healing arc three times with synonym churn ("peace," "hope," "resilience," "strength," "beacon"). Stock metaphors ("raw edges," "beacon of hope") and therapy-speak labels ("protected vulnerability") appear in peak beats without embodiment. Information density is low; scaffolding sentences do not advance story or character. Artifacts touch the closure, triggering elevated Q7 penalties and the global 9+ disqualifier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of calm"/"sense of wonder"/"sense of peace"/"sense of connection"/"sense of completion"/"sense of gratitude" recur without added pressure. Template cadence runs through "she felt" and "she knew" openings across a dozen sentences. Stock phrases cluster: "swimming against the current," "follow her heart," "true voice," "magic that lay just beyond." Apply −1.2 for loops and scaffold across high-frequency beats; the final paragraph is especially dense with synonym churn. Figurative language ("swirling hush") is repeated without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "remedy this" / "remedying the sense," "forgotten songs" appears seven times, "sacred practices" five times without variation. Template cadence runs through the middle: "As she worked… As the melody filled… As the morning wore on" anchors consecutive paragraphs mechanically. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh texture: "soft, ethereal light," "boundaries blur," "threads of community." Filter verbs ("seemed to," "began to") appear in most sentences during the climactic beat, dulling immediacy. The final two paragraphs loop Elara's satisfaction and future intention without advancing the present image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled, but paraphrase loops abound: "stillness so profound," "stillness was now moving," "world holding its breath" × 2, "safekept starlight" × 3. Template cadence appears in adjacent paragraphs ("As she worked… As the last rays… As she worked…"). Stock metaphors ("vessels for the deepest desires," "unseen territories of the heart") cluster in the closure third without fresh specificity. Momentum drags under synonym churn ("deliberate slowness," "slow, deliberate movements," "slowness that belied").

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.7)
    Rhythm varies adequately, but several paraphrase loops appear: "studying the device, observing" / "wonder of it all" / "secrets...secrets...secrets" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the middle third with repeated "As he [verb]" and "Elian's [noun]" sentence stems. The metaphor "cellar of reason" recurs without evolving. Clarity is maintained, but information density is low—multiple sentences restate Elian's fascination and the crystals' glow without advancing pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but momentum sags under reflection weight.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the weaver's understanding deepened, her perception of the world expanding" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs throughout ("As the night wore on," "As the sun rose higher," "As the seasons passed") without taught pattern or payoff (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("ripples on a still pond," "blanket of white") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to come alive," "seemed to hum," "seemed almost otherworldly") dull immediacy (−0.5). Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") without coherent vehicle or payoff (−0.4). The final third is saturated with these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sentences vary in structure and paragraph rhythm supports the meditative pace. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "sense of rust-hued peace settle over her" appears twice verbatim; "the pain of her loss" and "to contain" recur without added pressure; "the ash wood carving blank" is restated across adjacent paragraphs. The figurative register ("rust-hued," "crystallized time," "hauntingly practical") occasionally stacks without clear payoff. Information density is moderate; some lines restate rather than advance. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull closure sharpness, triggering cumulative Q7 penalties (−0.6 for loops and template cadence, per the patterned-artifact pack).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "fragments of overheard stories, whispers of what could have been, and snippets of conversations" restates one idea across three phrases; "negotiate with their own ghost, to reconcile the eroded ambitions" recurs verbatim multiple times. Template cadence: "They had once been... They heard tales of... They stood there..." runs across five paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "fire that had burned brightly," "embers were all that remained," "shroud." These artifacts touch the closure beat ("In that moment, they were negotiating..."), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.6)
    Heavy template cadence: "Maya's [noun] [verb]..." opens nine paragraphs; "The [noun] [verb]..." adds six more. Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: paragraphs 9–10 restate terminal transformation three times without new detail. Stock metaphors ("living thing," "beacon of possibility," "soft, inner light") dull specificity. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("seemed to be guiding," "began to envision," "felt a sense of wonder") flatten immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final three paragraphs loop "hope" and "brighter" without propulsion), triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sensory detail. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn reduce momentum: adjacent sentences restate Elian's emotional state ("calmed his thoughts and soothing his soul" / "sense of peace settle within him"), and the final third repeats "soundless sanctuary," "glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia" without added pressure. Template cadence—"Elian [verb]" stems across multiple beats—creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("embers of his former passion," "catalyst") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate; several sentences serve only to restate theme. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence concentrated across the story.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "hindsight clarity" and "thoughtfully clear" recur without reweighting; "serene upheaval" is repeated label-only. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "fabric of time bending," "tangled threads," "gentle lapping...unravel" mix metaphors. Template cadence runs through middle paragraphs ("As she...," "It was as if...," "With a quiet sense of..."). Information density is low; many sentences restate mood rather than advance situation. Stock phrasing ("weight of history," "hidden rhythms") dulls specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "secrets" recurs eight times, "ancient methods" three times, "sense of" five times, "fog" thirteen times. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "The collector [verb]" and "She [verb]" across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors ("sands of time," "tap into its deeper rhythms") and abstract emotional labels ("sense of peace," "sense of gratitude") flatten immediacy. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or character.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "silence…echoed," "fading light…melancholic shadows," "lonesome splendor…haunting and redemptive" restate mood without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("As I…," "The…," "I felt…") across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors (silence as "mournful sigh," thread as "fragile connections") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a sense of," "seemed to symbolize") dull immediacy throughout. Multiple artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph filter verbs and synonym churn), triggering the disallow-9+ clause globally and the −1.7 artifact penalty here.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the world was flawed" / "the world's flaws" / "the world slowly coming alive" / "the world around him begin to shift" / "the world's rebirth." Template cadence: "The prince felt… The prince's eyes… The prince's hands… The prince's heart…" across six sentences. Stock metaphors ("sleeping giant," "ghostly apparition," "mechanical heartbeat") clutter peak beats. Figurative density in the final third obscures rather than sharpens the closure image, triggering −1.4 for artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    Template cadence pervades: "Aria's thoughts," "Aria felt," "Aria stood," and "As the night wore on" recur across multiple beats without variation. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "sense of peace," "sense of belonging," "sense of hope" restate the same emotional claim. Stock metaphors ("scars can sing," "kelp-drift peace") are unearned. The final four paragraphs loop summary-level reflection without advancing situation or choice. Figurative language is strained: "clouds migrate" and "kelp-drift peace" feel forced and obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid sensory anchors and no major grammatical errors. Template cadence appears in several adjacent sentences ("She was a seeker… She was on a mission… She moved with…"), reducing propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal but present ("forgotten" recurs mechanically across many lines without intensification). Figurative language (luminous, sidereal, kaleidoscope) is slightly overwritten for the stakes but does not obscure causality. The opening and closing lines provide image-based framing without loops in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The sentimentalist's journey...the sentimentalist knew...the sentimentalist felt" recurs across a dozen paragraphs with minimal variation, and adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure (e.g., "path weaving through tendrils" followed by "traversed the nebula, their path weaving"). Stock metaphors ("stars bloomed like flowers," "cosmos unfolded like a flower") and synonym churn ("transit," "journey," "traversed") dull momentum. The final third repeats "troubling serenity" and "share light without fire" without new image or action, violating the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm varies naturally with lyric phrasing and purposeful paragraph structure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sense of peace settle over her" recurs twice within three paragraphs; "the carver felt" and "the carver smiled" are repeated stems. Stock metaphors—"turning of a great wheel," "intricate web of life and death"—dull specificity in peak beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") cluster in the second half without voice motivation. Clarity remains high, but information density sags in the closing third where summary replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "the weight of her past" is restated in multiple ways across adjacent paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence dominates: "As she stood… As she walked… As the sun dipped" creates mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("darkness receding," "threshold to a new beginning") and abstraction ("the power of redemption") replace concrete image at key beats. The phrase "incremental absolution" appears five times, functioning as thematic insistence rather than earned motif.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.1)
    Template cadence ("The gardener's X," "As Y") across eight+ sentences (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "uncharted echoes" restated in adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings: "thrum of uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom," "celestial map" (−0.4). Figurative density in every high-pressure sentence without payoff (−0.5). Synonym churn: "tenderly" appears four times without fresh context. High-band entry disallowed due to cumulative artifact presence (cap 8.7 not reached).

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the pen "hovered, poised" appears three times; "groundedly imaginative" twice; multiple restatements of "before the pen met the blank page" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through descriptive beats ("The air was crisp and cold," "The cartographer smiled," "As the writing continued"). Stock metaphors ("kaleidoscope of possibility," "branching tree of futures") cluster without fresh specificity. Figurative density in the middle third ("threads of probability," "narrative thread," "mental page") blurs rather than sharpens. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("poised on the threshold" recycled), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "The mist outside the alcove swirled" / "the mist outside seemed to be swirling" / "The mist closed in"; "As she [verb]" / "As the [noun]" sentence stems repeat across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("sea of sheet music," "narrative vortex," "portal to a realm") and synonym churn ("elusive"/"enigmatic," "diligent"/"unwavering") dull momentum. Figurative density in non-peak beats (e.g., "thistled calm," "secretly luminous," "mist-shrouded atmosphere") accumulates without clear payoff, and several beats restate content without advancing pressure (e.g., the final four paragraphs recycle "mist," "alcove," "dust," "radio dial" in near-identical phrasing). Apply −1.2 for cumulative loop and scaffold artifacts under the Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "Lena's gaze lingers…seems to weave truth…eyes appear to hold…Lena finds herself drawn" restates attraction across four consecutive sentences. Template stems ("As she…," "As they speak…," "As she turns…") appear in five paragraphs. The phrase "somber" appears four times, "fleeting" twice in adjacent beats—synonym churn without added pressure. Artifacts touch the final-third summary, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering −1.2 in Q7 for spread and closure proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops appear frequently: "Kael was a wannabe philosopher... Kael's eyes gleamed... Kael turned the cog... Kael didn't care... Kael began to agonize... Kael worked..." with repetitive stems across paragraphs. Figurative language is sometimes mixed ("maelstrom" of narratives, "waterlogged tomb") and overused without propulsion. Key moments are summarized rather than shown: "he began to agonize" instead of dramatizing the cognitive friction. Clarity is maintained, but density and momentum suffer under scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "vanishing arts" recurs four times with identical framing; "diverse voices" / "unified voice" / "sing as one" cycle without added pressure; the phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice as a mood label, never dramatized. Template cadence runs through much of the piece ("As she…," "As the…," "And so…"). Mixed metaphor: "braid diverse voices" conflates auditory and textile registers without coherent vehicle. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure any potential closure image, triggering accumulated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "testament to forgotten dreams" / "memories…lingered"; "gentle reverence" / "reverence" repeated within three lines; "create something beautiful" appears three times across the text. Template cadence in opening paragraphs: repeated "In…," "Here…," "The…" stems. Stock metaphor strings: "dance on her palate," "fabric of time," "beacon for the future." Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, template stems, and stock phrasing; no artifact touches closure directly, so remain within Q7. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same thematic claim without advancing situation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but information density is low; many sentences restate or decorate without advancing situation or character. Template cadence appears in the opening and closing paragraphs: repeated "The [noun], [modifier], [verb]" stems and paraphrase loops ("The toll keeper remained, watching as the stars began to twinkle" / "the toll keeper stood vigilant, ready to continue their work"). The metaphor "nectar dusk" is never grounded in concrete sensory detail, and the final paragraph stacks abstractions ("catalyst for connection," "beauty in unexpected places," "preserving wonder") that summarize theme rather than show. Mid-story, the log discovery is told rather than dramatized, flattening the key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but several paraphrase loops appear: "she wondered if it was possible... The perfumer's orris root shard... seemed to be the key" restates the question without advancing it. The phrase "shard of hush" recurs without functional variation. Abstract constructions ("the essence of its aliveness," "latent energy," "hidden rhythms and resonances") stack in the final third, dulling momentum. No major clarity breaks, but density is low—many sentences describe states rather than doing multiple jobs. The closing lines summarize rather than land an image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and scaffold dominate: "the statue realized" / "the statue's thoughts were filled" / "the statue knew" appear in near-identical stems across a dozen lines. The final third is especially redundant, cycling "thriving ecosystem," "beacon of life," "testament to transformation" without adding new information. Template cadence: multiple "As it [verb]" and "The statue [verb]" runs flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "animate the lifeless tone" conflates action with atmosphere incoherently. Clarity is serviceable, but density is low—many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems; −0.3 for the mixed metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "stairs seemed to stretch on forever, a never-ending labyrinth" immediately echoes "infinite staircase." Synonym churn clusters around the staircase ("stretch on forever," "never-ending blur," "endless, winding path") and the dice motif without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs across multiple sentences ("I was…," "The dice…," "As I climbed…"). Stock metaphors ("rabbit hole," "serpent") and therapy-speak constructs ("deep-seated motivation," "sense of self begin to fragment") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is low; most sentences restate the same conceptual claim.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "heart swelled with hope" / "promise of a brighter future," "saffron quiet of the night" recurs three times without reweighting. Scaffold phrasing: "As she [verb]" opens five sentences; "The painter's [noun]" opens six. Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicle: "sea of color and sound," "flame of hope," "whispers of the past." Information density is low; multiple paragraphs restate the project's purpose without advancing action or altering stance. Template cadence and synonym churn reduce propulsion across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.7)
    Paraphrase loops proliferate: "preserve the stories" / "preserving cultural heritage" / "keep the memories alive" / "preserving the stories of the past"; "city's secrets" / "stories that lay just beneath the surface" (repeated twice). Template cadence dominates the final third: "once... now" appears twice in succession, and "Elena's [noun]" opens multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("weight of their discovery," "mantle") and filter-verb stacks ("began to thaw," "continued to be," "felt a sense") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the escalated Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "mysterious lighthouse" recurs six times, "neatly inventive" three times, and the final four paragraphs restate transformation in synonym cycles ("changed," "transformed," "carry the latent radiance within him"). Template cadence dominates ("As he [verb]" opens five sentences in close succession). Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "felt") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("heart pounded," "wind whipping") and therapy-speak ("bleak exhilaration") reduce specificity. Applying the artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence, and stock phrasing touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "The whispering advisor's voice echoed/grew louder/grew more insistent/whispered/laughed/remained" across nine beats without propulsion. Template cadence runs ("I pushed...I spotted...I recalled...I shuddered...I stumbled...I caught sight") span the entire piece. Stock metaphors ("siren's call" appears twice, "dark presence," "cold, dead weight") and filter-verb stacks ("I felt," "I knew," "I realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Closure beat itself is abstract summary ("forever marked") rather than concrete image. Apply −1.4 for spread artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "sweet scent of blooming flowers" recurs three times; "creaked softly/gently" appears twice; "tiny, shining jewel" is restated identically. Template cadence runs through the final third ("The stars shone… The stars continued…"), and stock metaphors ("diamonds in the sky," "canopy of light") dull specificity. Information density is low; multiple sentences restate atmosphere without advancing pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to reverberate," "seemed to capture," "seemed to linger") flatten immediacy across high-priority beats, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.1)
    Clarity is high; no orientation or causality obscurity. Sentence rhythm varies, but runs of "Lyra felt" and "The [noun] [verb]" create template cadence in the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear: "sense of unease" / "oppressive and menacing"; "quietly driven" recurs without new pressure. "The watchers on the horizon seemed to loom larger" / "the watchers looming before her" / "the watchers watched" cycles without added charge. Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs (shell crack + hidden compartment), but scaffolding like "She knew that she had to continue" tells rather than shows urgency. No major line-level artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deductions to −0.8 total.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "disused railway station" echoed by "forsaken place," "hidden archive...collection of documents and relics," "truth behind...noble lies" repeated three times across paragraphs. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She had spent...She had heard...Her search led...Her task...She would do this"). The ivy anthropomorphized identically in three beats (skeletal fingers, pressing in, relaxing) without fresh propulsion. Figurative density ("ghostly figure taking shape," "shaft of light," "symbol of triumph") stacks without coherence. Information density is low; many sentences restate the task rather than advance it. The −0.8 to −1.4 artifact penalty applies, with loops touching the closure image (ivy relaxing).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "The surveyor's task was not merely to survey, but to wrest..." / "The surveyor's task was not just to document the past, but to preserve it..." Multiple paragraphs restate the same thematic claim without added pressure. Figurative language ("hushed blaze," "interlaced absence") appears frequently but remains abstract rather than embodied. Clarity is maintained but information density is low; many sentences do only one job (thematic assertion) without advancing situation or character knowledge. Scaffold sentences like "As the surveyor worked..." and "The surveyor's thoughts turned to..." slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Elara felt…" appears five times; "the antique ink stamp" recurs in near-identical constructions; adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure (e.g., paragraph 2's "deep connection" and "silence had been waiting"). Stock metaphors ("pieces began to fall into place") and abstract intensifiers ("sense of excitement building") replace concrete progression. Register drifts into corporate-speak ("formulate an alternative hypothesis") mid-peak without voice motivation. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template stems −0.5, stock phrasing −0.4, totaling −1.1 in Q7. Final artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("dappled resolve," "lessons she had learned"), triggering the artifact-in-final-third cap at 8.8 globally and disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "transforming sorrow into something radiant" echoes "transform his grief into something tangible," and "luminous torment" recurs without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("damp shroud," "lotus flower") and elevated diction ("ephemeral whispers," "hallowed halls") drift into purple register. Template cadence—runs of "As [subject] [verb]" and "The [noun], [descriptor], seemed to [verb]"—flattens rhythm across high-pressure beats (the final sequence). Information density is low: many sentences restate mood without advancing knowledge or choice. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 line-level penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops dominate: "unused potential" appears six times with synonym churn ("stagnant potential pooling," "hidden reservoirs of unused potential"). Template cadence runs through paragraphs 19–22: "As [subject] [verb]" opener pattern repeats four times. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats: "felt the world around her begin to shift," "felt the full weight," "felt the intangibly tangible presence." Stock metaphors: "brutal confrontation," "beacon, illuminating the path." Artifacts touch closure (final two paragraphs), triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "sense of anticipation"/"sense of expectation," "missing pieces"/"missing piece" (x3), "ancient"/"ancients" (x7 uses), "frequency of belonging" repeated without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive beats mid-story. Stock metaphors cluster: "diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse," "thread of clues," "kaleidoscope of hues." The final third stacks summary telling ("she felt," "she knew") that restates rather than advances. Information density is low—many sentences do one job only. Clarity is intact, but momentum drags under synonym churn and scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    Paraphrase loops recur: "the weight of unspoken words" restated as "the weight of her guilt and the burden of her secrets" and "the weight of a withheld truth." Template cadence ("She stared… She recalled… She picked up… She would follow…") flattens momentum. Filter verbs ("seemed to be," "felt different," "felt a sense of") cluster without voice motivation. Mixed metaphor: driftwood carvings "washed up like skeletal fingers" then "yielded up their secrets" mixes organic decay with treasure-giving. Figurative density ("mournful sigh," "deep blue gloom," "lunar glow," "swallowed her whole") in nearly every paragraph without pattern payoff triggers overwriting deduction. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.7)
    Template cadence pervades: "She felt...she had helped...," "The mist swirled...a reminder...," "As the moon...she turned...," "For in the furrowed hush...she had found...." Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs recycle "delicate balance," "fragile balance," "weight of responsibility," "weight of past mistakes." "Furrowed hush" is a mixed metaphor (furrowed = visual/tactile, hush = auditory). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she had watched") dull immediacy in peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure sequence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "As he paddled further out to sea, Jack felt his faith begin to flicker back to life" then "He knew that he still had a long way to go, but with each stroke of the paddle, he felt himself gravitating towards a new sense of purpose." Template cadence runs through the final third: "As he [verb]..." opens five sentences in closing paragraphs. Stock metaphors (candle flame in wind, golden glow) dull peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same emotional arc without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "ethereal glow" / "otherworldly light" / "bioluminescent energy" repeat without added information; "labyrinth of choices" is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs; "walked" and "walking" appear in nearly every beat without variation. Template cadence runs dominate ("As she walked… she felt," "As she stood… Lena felt," "As she walked… the mist began"). Figurative language stacks without coherence: the ball "seemed to glow with an inner light" immediately after being described as signed, and the lake "pulsing with an otherworldly energy, as if it were alive" adds metaphor without advancing sense. Information density is low; entire paragraphs restate Lena's determination and the message's meaning. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("disappeared into the mist… lost in the labyrinth"), triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.7)
    Grammar and syntax are clean with no major loops or scaffolding. However, information density is low: multiple sentences restate transformation abstractly ("becoming one with the creatures," "essence merging," "expansion, a growth") without advancing new detail. Stock phrases proliferate ("shiver run down her spine," "tears streaming down her face," "sense of wonder, a sense of awe"). Figurative language in the climax ("kaleidoscope of colors and textures," "cosmic harmony," "cosmic intimacy") stacks without concrete grounding, obscuring what physically happens to Lyra. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("harbinger of change") rather than trusting the image to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "sense of understanding," "sense of longing," "sense of peace," and "sense of acceptance" cluster in the final third without varied syntax. Template cadence ("The cartomancer's [noun]" opens five sentences) and synonym churn ("understanding begin to dawn" / "deeper understanding") reduce propulsion. Figurative language ("choking beauty," "halo of mist," "threads in a tapestry") is dense but does not muddle clarity. The accumulation of these artifacts, especially touching the closure beat, triggers baseline −0.6 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.1)
    Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: "guardian of the ship's history" / "guardian of the threshold"; "the past come alive" / "memories of the past would continue to illuminate." Template cadence runs: "She was…," "As she…," "The air was…" Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "fabric of reality," "catalyst for transformation," "beacon of peace." Stock metaphors pervade peak beats ("heart swelled," "stars…twinkle in anticipation"). Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("transformative power," "indomitable will") alien to the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispering hush" appears six times with synonym churn ("more insistent," "grew even louder," "revealed its secrets"). Template cadence runs through the final third ("Aria knew... Aria felt... Aria's journey..."). Stock metaphors (stars aligning, slow dance) and therapy-speak ("texture of transformation") flatten peak beats. The final two paragraphs restate the same thematic summary three times without added pressure, creating a −1.0 loop penalty that touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops: "The darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun" echoes "The luminous fort at twilight was being reborn" and multiple restatements of revolution gaining momentum (−0.6). Template cadence dominates: "As she stood… As she watched… As the sentinel looked…" across adjacent paragraphs (−0.5). Stock metaphors cluster without earned resonance: "spreading like wildfire," "beacon of hope," "inky darkness." Sentence rhythm is uniform; nearly every complex action uses past-perfect or participle openers. Figurative language appears in most lines without variation or payoff, violating the overwriting density check (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops appear: "The sequence grew, a intricate pattern…" echoes "positions calculated to reflect the intricate dance…" Template cadence runs dominate ("The herder's X," "As the Y") across multiple paragraphs (−0.6). Stock phrases ("otherworldly glow," "sense of peace") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the precognitive curse stirring," "seemed to vibrate") dull immediacy (−0.5). Figurative language is dense but often vague ("fabric of reality," "symphony of pattern"). Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    Paraphrase loops pervade: "the storm raging outside seemed to be a manifestation of the turmoil within" / "storm was stripping away the layers"; "seeking to understand the cartography of scars" / "comprehension of the cartography of scans that had haunted her"; "the masks...were beginning to slip" / "ready to confront the truths." Template cadence runs: "She had always been drawn..." / "She had used this method before..." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicles: "maddening vortex," "washing away the detritus," "threads of a tapestry." These artifacts dull the closure beat—"the poet smiled, knowing that she would always be drawn to the hidden patterns"—into scaffolding rather than earned image. Sentence openings repeat structural stems across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.9)
    Multiple paraphrase loops: "the danish tin sewing needle card…seemed to weigh heavier" / "now back in his hand…seemed to hold a new significance"; "the true challenge lay" / "the true victory lay"; "questions…waiting to be turned into destinations" repeated verbatim. Template cadence: runs of "As he [verb], he [verb]" across paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "threads that connected," "battleground," "vanished into the shadows." Figurative density in the final third (orange glow, faint silhouette, gentle reminder) without payoff. The climax beat ("The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear") is summary rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "beautiful from anarchy" restated as "resilience... power of art," "newfound sense of purpose" repeated twice within three paragraphs, and "eyes shone" / "eyes snapped back" / "eyes adjusted" / "eyes shone" cycle through similar constructions. Template cadence runs dominate transitions ("As the moon rose higher... As the night wore on... With a newfound sense of purpose"). Stock phrases ("torn apart by conflict," "phoenix from the ashes," "beacon of hope") cluster in closure beats. Sentence openings vary minimally in the final third. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings and no run-on template cadence. Information density is moderate; many sentences layer atmosphere without advancing choice ("the air was thick with the scent of wet stone and ozone"). Figurative language is frequent but controlled (mist, vortex, fireflies), though "flickering compasses seemed to be guiding her towards some unknown destination" and similar constructions repeat the seem/felt/knew pattern across multiple paragraphs, creating a distancing filter stack. No major loops or contradictions, but scaffold phrases like "she knew that" and "the pianist felt" appear in close succession, dulling immediacy in peak beats. The final third recycles "the compasses continued to flicker" and "the music faded away" motifs without fresh detail.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.4)
    Moderate line-level debt from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Phrases like "The air was alive with...a serene atmosphere that belied the urgency" and "The air was filled with an expectant energy" restate mood without advancing pressure. Runs of "Aria [verb]" stems create rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("treasure trove of experiences," "mosaic of moments") and elevated diction ("symbiosis," "luminous doubt") drift above the grounded voice needed for a fantasy reality checker. Figurative language in most sentences of descriptive beats (blooming flowers, warm sunlight, verdant world) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Clarity remains intact but density is low; many sentences describe rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Sentence variety is present and rhythm supports the placid tone. However, paraphrase loops appear: "felt the weight of regret" / "cerulean regret still lingered"; "rhythmically placid atmosphere" recurs unchanged. Template cadence in the students-epilogue section ("As Kaito's students grew and learned, they carried…") stalls momentum. The compass-release beat uses summary ("felt the weight…slowly lift") instead of concrete image, dulling closure. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs touching the ending third.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatical, fluent, and largely clear, with some pleasant images (“delicate scales glinting in the faint light”). It suffers from repetition and paraphrase loops—concepts like “gradual change,” “accumulated dust patterns,” and “intricate patterns” are reiterated with minimal new information. Many sentences summarize ideas instead of advancing scene or character, which flattens momentum. There’s no egregious purple prose or syntactic confusion, but line-level craft doesn’t yet reach the precision or density expected for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but there is notable repetition of structures and concepts (stillness, patterns, sense of peace, resonance) without new information. Abstractions and summary phrases (“she felt a sense of clarity emerging,” “she knew that she had finally found her way”) often substitute for concrete dramatization. The prose tends toward mild purple, with stacked modifiers and similar cadences that slightly dull momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not especially taut or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean, easy to follow, and often pleasing, with a consistent sensory palette and no major muddle. There is noticeable redundancy and abstraction—phrases like “sense of peace,” “frazzled nerves,” “catalyst for her creativity,” and “fragile, frosted world” stack rather than layer, softening impact. A few sentences effectively do double duty (e.g., the plants leaning in as listeners), but others repeat emotional summary instead of advancing image or tension. Overall, competent and smooth but not yet razor-honed or maximally economical.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it relies heavily on repetition and summary (“The weary undertaker…,” “sense of peace,” “stillness”) rather than high-density, multi-tasking sentences. Several adjacent lines restate the same content with slight variations, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe, and there is little rhythmic variation or sharpened image-work at climactic moments (e.g., the device activation is told in a few flat sentences). Line-level craft is functional but lacks compression, surprise, or verbal precision expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence-level craft is competent: syntax is clear, errors are absent, and the rhythm is generally smooth if somewhat monotonous. There is some redundancy and scaffolding (“a reminder that…” recurs; several sentences re-explain the same idea of solidarity and resilience), which slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe, so there’s little risk but also limited memorability. Most lines do one job at a time (telling theme or summarizing backstory) rather than layering image, emotion, and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, with some evocative lines (“atmosphere of foggy lucidity,” “blossoms seemed to unfurl like tiny stars”). That said, there is a heavy reliance on similar abstract formulations (“deep sense of,” “otherworldly energy,” “mystical ambiance”) and repeated structures that create a faintly purple, padded feel. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same emotional state (peace, understanding, connection) with minor variation, which softens momentum. Figurative language is pleasant but not always economical or freshly concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally lush, especially in the opening description of the garden. Yet there is considerable abstraction and repetition—“texture of time,” “fabric of reality,” “metaphysical odyssey”—that add little new information and slow momentum. Several sentences paraphrase prior ones with slight variation, and figurative language like “quaking reverie” drifts toward purple without grounding in concrete action. Line by line, the piece is serviceable but not tightly edited or dynamically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are clear and mostly concise, and the piece is free of grammatical errors. Yet there is substantial paraphrase and conceptual looping (reiterating hope, resilience, bright future, and the liberator’s purpose in similar terms across multiple lines). Figurative or elevated phrases are often stock rather than sharp, which blunts impact. Line-level craft does the job but lacks the compression, variety, and specificity expected at a prestigious literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, but it relies heavily on repetition and abstract phrasing (“as she worked,” “as the night wore on,” “even in the darkest moments”) that add little new information. Many sentences restate the same emotional idea (ongoing pain, healing, hope) rather than layering specificity, which dampens momentum in such a short piece. Some images are fresh (cells dividing alongside her work), but figurative language is used sparingly and safely. Tightening redundancy and grounding more emotions in concrete moments would significantly elevate the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but heavily overwritten, with many near-duplicate sentences and adjective stacks (“soft, ethereal light,” “soft, lunar glow,” “fleeting golden sunset”) that do not add new information. Several beats paraphrase the same idea—Lumina capturing magic, destiny whispering, reality blurring—without advancing situation or pressure. Rhythm is monotonously lush with little variation in sentence music, which dulls impact. Pruning and sharpening would greatly increase momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically sound and often graceful, with some strong sensory lines and a steady rhythm suitable for a contemplative piece. Yet it tends toward redundancy (reiterating thawing, purpose, safe zones) and occasionally lapses into purple abstraction (“the weighty lightness of creation,” “morbid perfume”) without adding new information or pressure. Figurative density is relatively high given the low-stakes scene, which slightly dulls momentum. Tightening repetition and trimming a few ornate phrases would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with a straightforward rhythm that keeps the piece readable. However, there is noticeable redundancy (“firmly adaptive nature” appears more than once; many sentences reiterate resolve or fear without adding new facets), and several lines tell what’s already implied. The descriptive language is serviceable but often generic (“brighter future,” “sense of peace wash over me”), and the emotional beats are over-explained instead of sharpened through image. Trimming repetition and leaning on more specific, multi-tasking sentences would significantly tighten the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is polished and mostly clear, with many sentences doing double duty for mood and action. However, it leans into purple repetition (“ambered hush,” “flaking gold leaf booklet,” storms/silence) and a dense metaphor load that can feel redundant rather than accumulatively sharp. Rhythm and syntax vary somewhat but often hover in the same slow, honeyed register, which blunts momentum. There are no glaring grammatical slips, but some pruning would heighten impact and reduce decorative echo.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and generally clear, and the piece maintains a steady, readable cadence. However, there is substantial repetition of phrases and ideas (Zeta's composure, the second chance program's "success," the peaceful courtyard), amounting to paraphrase loops rather than new information. Many lines tell the reader what symbols and moments mean instead of letting images carry that weight, which saps momentum. Line-level craft feels careful but padded and slightly mechanical rather than sharp and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking (“resonant hush,” “ambiguously clear glass”), and it maintains a coherent rhythm. Yet many adjacent sentences paraphrase each other, especially around the lens, mistrust melting, and transparency, leading to momentum drag. Figurative language trends generic and is often repeated instead of evolved, giving a faintly templated feel. Line-level craft is solid but undercut by redundancy and lack of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and often pleasant, with some effective images (“withering beauty,” marbles as “small beacons in the fading light”). Yet there is substantial paraphrase looping and repetitive scaffolding—many sentences begin similarly (“The dresser…,” “The marbles…,” “It was said…”) and restate prior points. Abstract, clichéd phrases (“a truth that was both simple and profound,” “testament to the power of nurturing”) dilute impact and slow momentum. Tighter, more varied sentences with fewer generic abstractions would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is fluent and mostly clear, with clean syntax and few outright missteps, but it overindulges in familiar figurative language and repetition (“power coursing through her veins,” “icy warmth,” “sense of awe/wonder”). Several sentences restate similar emotional beats without adding pressure or nuance. The density of modifiers and abstractions in peak beats slightly blurs rather than sharpens sensory impact. Line-level craft is serviceable yet not trim or original enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, and the imagery is consistent, but there is significant repetition of concepts and constructions that creates a looped, padded feel. Many lines retread the same ideas (liminal spaces, hush of unstruck chords, flickering lanterns) without adding new pressure or nuance. Sentence structures are often similar and connective scaffolding (“As she…,” “Now, as…”) abounds, reducing momentum and density. Figurative language stays within safe, literal bounds, avoiding major confusion but also limiting sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and often beautiful at the image level (e.g., “like a landscape taking shape in the mist,” “presence smudged, like a charcoal drawing”). However, it leans on abstract, near-redundant formulations (“not a fixed or determinate thing, but rather a fluid, context-dependent construct”) and repeats similar conceptual moves about truth and uncertainty. This creates mild paraphrase loops and a slight sense of over-explanation that slows momentum. Line-level craft is solid but not yet lean or varied enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is largely grammatical and readable, with some strong images (“morbid perfume that clung to every surface”), but also leans on redundancies and conceptual repetition. Phrases and ideas recur with little added nuance (the valve wheel’s repeated mention, “weighty truth,” “swallowed truth,” “finally found what they were looking for”), creating a mild paraphrase loop. Emotional labels and abstractions often replace concrete, scene-specific language. Overall momentum suffers slightly under the weight of restatement and generalized description.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with a few evocative lines (“the whispers of forgotten lore,” “crumbling peace”) and solid sensory grounding. Yet there is noticeable paraphrase looping and redundancy: the same ideas (“remained steadfast,” “across the drift of untold seasons,” the regenerative silence as balm) are reiterated without adding pressure or new facets. Figurative language is safe rather than risky, and many sentences do only one job where two would be expected at this level. Momentum suffers as the line-level texture circles the same abstractions instead of cutting deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is mostly clean and grammatical, with a consistent cadence and some effective images. There is noticeable redundancy at the paragraph and sentence level—variations on “ordinary magic,” “connection,” and “wonder” recur without adding new facets. Figurative phrases like “hush of dreaming roots” are evocative but not always integrated into action, and the overall texture edges toward purple in places. Momentum is adequate for a quiet piece but could be sharper with tighter, less repetitive lines.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatical and readable but suffers from repetition and mild purple tendencies (“bronze quiet,” “treasure trove of secrets,” “heady aroma”) without proportional payoff. Many adjacent sentences paraphrase one another about atmosphere and Emilia’s desire to uncover mysteries, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is safe and conventional rather than precise or surprising. Overall, line-level craft is competent but not yet at a high-literary, publish-ready standard.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean, but there is heavy scaffolding and paraphrase-looping: numerous sentences repeat that the Oracle’s life will change, that the lighthouse is mysterious, that the night was thick with energy, etc., without adding new information. Many phrases are abstract (“otherworldly energy,” “new understanding,” “new reality”) and could apply to any mystical encounter, reducing vividness. The microdot specs, wooden box, and tavern are never rendered with concrete sensory specificity, and modifiers like “mysterious,” “cryptic,” and “familiar enigma” substitute for image-level work. This redundancy flattens momentum and blurs what should be peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sentences are grammatically clean, but the prose leans heavily on abstraction (“essence of the divine,” “plumbing the depths of the human experience”) and paraphrase loops. Key phrases and concepts (“underlying truths,” “hidden assumptions,” “scent of sandalwood and myrrh”) are repeated without adding new information or pressure. This softens momentum and leaves the climax and aftermath feeling verbally, rather than dramatically, heightened.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean, with some strong images (“glass spire…like a shard of ice”) and solid sensory anchoring. Yet figurative language and abstract phrases are repeated rather than deepened (“unheard symphonies,” “boundaries between reality and reflection,” “testament to the beauty”) creating paraphrase loops that sap momentum. The density of similar constructions and near-duplicate ideas produces a mild purple-prose effect without outright obscuring meaning. Trimming redundancies and sharpening a few metaphors would significantly tighten the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking (“between the drop and the ripple” is strong), but it is burdened by repetition and paraphrase (“ancient clay tablet with runes” reappears almost verbatim, as do several abstract phrases). Many sentences restate the same idea—her determination, transformation, or power—without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language is generally coherent, yet the density of high-level abstractions dulls momentum. Overall, line craft is functional rather than sharp, with noticeable scaffolding and loops.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some vivid lines and a cohesive sensory palette. However, it leans heavily on repetition and near-paraphrase across adjacent sentences and paragraphs (e.g., multiple invocations of seasons turning, the cavern as sanctuary/womb, Aria’s presence enthralling the space). Figurative language sometimes stacks without adding new precision, and key abstractions (“emotional numbness,” “filament of hush,” “mirrored hush”) recur more as labels than evolving images. This creates a mild sense of purple, looping texture that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally clear, but there is noticeable repetition of ideas and rhythms (tranquility, stars, stillness, resolve) without added nuance. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same emotional state or decision, which softens momentum and density. Diction is mostly plain with scattered elevated or slightly off-kilter word choices that don’t feel voice-motivated. The line-level work is competent but not yet tightened or sharpened to elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, but it suffers from redundancy and a tendency toward abstract, stock phrases (“filled her with a sense of wonder,” “a sense of peace settle over her”). Key motifs and realizations are rephrased multiple times without adding new nuance, which softens momentum. Figurative language is consistent in register but often obvious, edging into purple without deepening meaning. Tightening for concision and sharpening images would markedly improve line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is grammatically clean and readable, but heavily repetitive: numerous sentences restate that she uncovers layers, reveals hidden truths, and feels the texture of time, often in nearly identical cadence. Abstractions (“human condition,” “patterns of human creativity,” “impossible choices”) substitute for specific images, which dulls impact and momentum. The rhythmic similarity of sentences and frequent paraphrase loops give the piece a droning feel rather than a sculpted progression. The closure image is clear but not sharpened by line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is fluent and often evocative (“glass panes glinting like shards of ice amidst the blackened trees”), and sentence mechanics are clean. Yet there is substantial repetition of key phrases (“chronic hush,” “beauty,” “transformed by the power of art and connection”) and paraphrased sentiments that slow momentum. Figurative density sometimes flattens impact rather than intensifying it, and the closing paragraphs loop the same idea of transformed hush multiple times. Despite this, clarity remains intact and there are no major syntactic or logical tangles.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasant, with some strong images (“warm, honey-like light,” “affectionate detachment”). Yet there is noticeable redundancy: many sentences restate similar ideas about warmth, glow, and careful crafting without adding pressure or new information. The result is mild momentum drag and a sense of sameness in sentence structure. Figurative language stays coherent but edges toward purple in places without compensating intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is competent: sentences are clear, mechanically correct, and mostly free of clutter. There is some redundancy and template phrasing (“It turned out that…”, “It was a reminder that…”) and a tendency to tell rather than dramatize key shifts. Figurative language is sparse but safe; nothing egregiously purple or muddled. The prose does its job but rarely carries extra weight or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with an evident wish for lyricism. However, it leans on repetition and stock abstractions (e.g., “glimmering obsidian arbor” and “webs of kinship” recur with little new nuance), causing a sense of synonym-looping rather than progression. Many sentences summarize emotional or thematic content instead of advancing scene, which saps momentum in what is already a low-conflict piece. Overall, the line-level work is serviceable but somewhat generic and over-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, with rhythmic sentences and a lyrical cadence that suits the material, and most lines do at least one job. There is some repetition of concepts (“essence,” “cadence,” “rhythm”) and a tendency toward abstract mysticism instead of concrete embodiment, which flattens momentum. One clear grammatical error (“was being sculpts time itself”) and occasional purple-ish constructions keep it below top-tier line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical with some evocative lines, and there are no major clarity issues. That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases (“gently inventive nature,” “mathematics of emotion,” “ambiguous loss”), and several sentences restate similar ideas without adding pressure or nuance. Figurative and descriptive language occasionally edge toward the purple and abstract, softening momentum. Tightening redundant lines and grounding key abstractions in more concrete sensory or emotional specifics would markedly improve line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and frequently vivid at the line level, with economical but concrete sensory choices. However, there are paraphrase loops and near-duplicate sentiments (“kindly methodical soul,” “hidden nooks and crannies,” “hidden world, just out of sight”) that add a slight sense of redundancy. Figurative language remains tasteful, though “sapphire hush” and similar phrases verge on the ornamental because they don’t alter action or stakes. Momentum is gently sustained but never tight; many sentences describe mood rather than advancing situation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from heavy repetition and conceptual redundancy (“growth and renewal,” “beauty and growth,” “transformative,” “metamorphosis” recur without new shading). Many adjacent sentences paraphrase one another, which blunts momentum and dilutes impact. Abstract nouns and stock phrasing do much of the work where sharper images and concrete moments could. The final paragraphs, in particular, read like variations on the same sentiment without added pressure or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and clear, and it maintains momentum without obvious syntactic clutter. However, it leans heavily on repetitive structures and abstract labels (“sense of purpose,” “sense of closure,” “the more I realized”), with minimal vivid, concrete scene work. Key beats are summarized rather than embodied, which flattens tension and sensory richness. Figurative language is sparse but safe, leaving the line-level work competent rather than striking.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally fluid, but leans on repeated abstract formulations (“forces beyond the veil of the mundane,” “threads of magic and wonder,” “intricate web of energies”) that blur rather than sharpen impact. Several sentences paraphrase each other conceptually, especially around Aria’s expanding abilities and the cave’s vibrational magic, which slightly dulls momentum. Despite some purple tendencies, clarity is maintained and no major figurative muddle undermines the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, but it leans heavily on repetitive structures and paraphrase loops (“a testament to…”, “a beacon of hope”, “power of remembrance”) that dilute impact. Many sentences restate similar ideas about healing and rebirth without adding new image or pressure, especially in the latter half. Figurative language is mild and not egregiously mixed, yet the accumulation of abstract nouns and generic uplift blunts momentum. Tighter cuts and more concrete, scene-based lines would significantly strengthen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but burdened by repetition and paraphrase loops—many sentences restate that she is determined, that secrets wait, that the mist deepens, without adding new information or pressure. Modifiers like “otherworldly,” “ethereal,” “mysterious,” and “hidden” recur, creating a gauzy sameness instead of sharpening images. Momentum suffers as multiple paragraphs reiterate her certainty and purpose rather than advancing scene or tension. Line-level craft is serviceable but not lean or dynamically charged enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with no major clarity issues, and it flows line to line with reasonable momentum for a quiet piece. However, there is evident scaffold and repetition: phrases like “hidden patterns,” “entangled memories,” and “unheard symphony” recur without fresh inflection, giving a mild looped feel. Abstractions and stock mystical formulations (“very fabric of reality,” “alchemy of memory and imagination”) blunt specificity and emotional sharpness. Line-level craft is competent but not yet at the compression and precision expected for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but prone to repetition and abstraction: similar phrases recur (“colors… danced/swirl/deepened,” “otherworldly energy,” “electric tension”) without adding new information or pressure. Many sentences do the same job twice in slightly different words, which blunts momentum. Figurative language stays in a safe, familiar register and sometimes tips toward purple without sharpening meaning. Line-level craft is functional but not compressed or surprising enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and mostly fluent, with a few striking phrases (“deathly vitality,” “morbid beauty”) and generally sound syntax and mechanics. There is noticeable repetition and conceptual redundancy, especially around “waiting actively,” the ink pot as guide, and the “mathematics” phrasing, which slightly dull momentum. Some lines drift toward purple or abstract (“seemed to be a tangible representation of the uncertain future ahead”) without adding new pressure or specificity. Overall, it’s serviceable and occasionally vivid, but not yet as distilled or multi-tasking as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft is clean and grammatical, with clear sequencing and no genuine confusion, and it sustains a consistent mood. That said, there is heavy repetition of key words and constructions (“textures,” “forest,” “hum,” “notepad,” “The air was filled…”), and many sentences restate similar ideas without adding pressure or new facets. Figurative language sometimes edges into mild purple without sharpening meaning, contributing to a slight sense of blur. Trimming loops and varying syntax would greatly increase momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is fluent but padded, with frequent near-duplicates (“texture of memories,” “erased histories,” “a reminder that time was always in motion”) and many sentences that reiterate rather than advance. Template stems (“The survivor’s [noun]…”; “The labyrinth, with its towering containers…”) recur, dulling rhythm and momentum. Abstractions dominate over concrete, multi-purpose images, reducing information density. These line-level habits sap energy and make the quiet structure feel even more static.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally evocative (“whisper of closing pages”) but leans heavily on repetition and abstraction. Phrases and structures recur with minimal new information (“whispers of the past,” “gloomy cheerfulness,” “she knew that she would return”), creating paraphrase loops. Descriptors tend to be general (“sense of peace,” “newfound understanding”) rather than sharply concrete, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than surprising, and the density of near-duplicate lines in the final third blunts the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is competent and readable but highly repetitive in structure and concept, often restating the same ideas (unity, resistance, preservation of essence) with minor variation. Many sentences perform identical work, leading to paraphrase loops and a sense of outline-like narration. Figurative language is sparse and safe; line-level rhythm doesn’t notably heighten key beats. Information density is moderate, but momentum is dulled by reiteration and lack of scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but it suffers from redundancy and purple edges (e.g., two near-identical sentences about “stillness” and “dawning hush”). Adjectives and intensifiers are stacked (“silvery glow,” “vast, barren expanse,” “soft, melancholic glow”) without always adding new information, leading to mild bloat. Some metaphors and phrases recur without progression, creating a sense of looping rather than building. Information density is moderate, but tighter, more selective lines would sharpen both image and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with a steady, flowing cadence and some effective images (mist as “a living entity,” light that “danced through the droplets”). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition of phrases (“mist-coated rail depot,” “beacon,” “harmony,” “gentle fog”) and several near-duplicate sentences that restate calm and tranquility without adding new information. Figurative language trends toward the purple in places and could be pruned for concision and sharper contrast. Overall, line craft is competent and pleasant but not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Grammar and syntax are clean, and individual sentences are generally clear, but there is substantial repetition at the line and paragraph level (“the snow crunched beneath her feet” appears multiple times; “the world was full of mysteries/wonder” echoes). Many sentences do single, declarative jobs instead of layering image, action, and interiority, which flattens momentum. Intensifiers and summary phrases (“fierce determination,” “growing sense of urgency,” “worrying tranquility”) often substitute for more concrete dramatization. The prose is competent but padded and occasionally purple, which dulls the closing image’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally well-shaped, with a smooth, steady rhythm that fits the meditative mode. There is some redundancy (“infinitely patient,” multiple near-identical descriptions of rhythm and cobblestones) and a tendency to explain the method after already implying it, which slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language stays coherent and not over-stacked, avoiding purple excess. The line craft is solid but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but repetition and abstraction sap momentum: phrases like “the lonesome splendor of her task,” “the gathered hush of the temple's secrets,” and “touching memories” recur without deepening. Many lines paraphrase the same idea in slightly different terms, and key actions are carried by vague verbs (“harness,” “unsnarl,” “capture”) rather than concrete dramatization. The effect leans toward purple without earning the density through precision. Line-level craft works, but would need tightening and sharpening for publication at a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose has some strong images (the scuffed door, salt and decay, the lattice light) and a consistent cadence, but it leans into repetition and abstraction that dilute impact. Phrases and structures recur with little added pressure (“to thread the labyrinth with his own story” appears multiple times; “he felt”/“as he walked” stems dominate), creating a sense of paraphrase loops. Figurative language occasionally drifts toward purple (“sustain impossibilities,” “chased the hush”) without concrete grounding, blurring rather than sharpening moments. Overall readability is fine, but line-level tightening and more selective imagery would significantly raise momentum and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose has flashes of beauty but leans heavily on repetition (“resonant awakenings,” “ghost bride,” “greenhouse” as mantra) and summary, which blunts impact. Many sentences restate similar content (her debt, his guidance, the bead’s importance) without adding new nuance or pressure. Figurative language is generally coherent but occasionally drifts toward purple or generic (“gift of understanding,” “true nature of her actions”) rather than specific image. Line-level craft is serviceable but not at elite-publication density or sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but there is notable redundancy and a tendency toward purple, abstract phrasing. Key motifs and claims are restated multiple times (“testament to the power of art,” “path from ruin to reverence”) without new information or pressure, creating a looped, sermon-like effect. Figurative language is generally coherent but often generic and overused. Line-level craft is functional yet not economical or sharply textured enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some strong images (“roots snaked between ancient bones like nature’s own intricate network”). However, there are frequent paraphrase loops and stock phrasings—“she felt a sense of…,” “a sense of wonder,” “a sense of harmony,” “a sense of pride”—that dilute impact and slow momentum. Many sentences do the same job twice, especially when summarizing interior states, which lowers information density. Rhythm remains mostly even and undifferentiated across beats, so the closing cadence doesn’t sharpen as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean, but it leans into repetition and scaffold: many sentences restate the same ideas of anticipation, nostalgia, and beauty of surface mail. Figurative language is often generic or slightly overblown (“pulsate with an energy all its own,” “vast ocean of correspondence”) without adding new insight. Sentence rhythm is fairly monotonous and many paragraphs could be compressed without loss of information or charge. These line-level redundancies dull momentum and make the lyrical mode feel padded rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but relies heavily on repetitive structures (“As the…”, “The embroiderer…”, “The flame…”) and paraphrase loops that restate the same ideas (urgency, shimmering threads, otherworldly energy). Figurative language tends toward the vague and stock (“otherworldly energy,” “secrets that lay just beyond the edge of perception”), which dulls impact. Momentum suffers slightly under the weight of similar sentences and reiterated concepts, though clarity remains intact. Line-level craft is competent but far from razor-honed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, with strong sensory choices and clean grammar. That said, there is noticeable repetition in structures and concepts (“the singing spirits” recur with similar phrasing; multiple sentences restate Aria’s role or the letters’ significance), edging into mild redundancy. Some lines drift toward purple or abstract (“moment before deciding”) without always grounding that abstraction in concrete action. Momentum survives, but tighter line-editing and more varied syntax would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically sound and occasionally vivid, but it leans heavily on abstraction and repetition (“lotus-hearted ache,” “old wounds,” “shared anxieties,” mist swirling, coral glowing). Many sentences rephrase the same insight without adding pressure or new detail, creating a sense of loop rather than build. Figurative language sometimes feels ornamental rather than necessary, and concrete action is sparse. The closure image works, but it has been dulled by prior overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, grammatically sound, and flows smoothly, with clear sequencing and little outright clutter. Some phrases and concepts repeat without adding new pressure or nuance (fog, lost joy, beauty “just beyond the edge of perception”), which introduces mild redundancy. Imagery is generally coherent, but modifiers sometimes stack in a way that risks bland lyricism rather than precision. Overall, the line-level craft is above average but not yet sharp or economical enough to feel fully polished.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains many pleasing images and a consistent sonic motif, but it is also burdened by repetition and abstraction (“seemed to,” “as if,” “beginning to,” reiterated garden descriptions) that dilute impact. Several sentences restate similar ideas about curiosity, transformation, and the garden’s liveliness without adding new pressure or specificity, which drags momentum in the latter third. Figurative language sometimes trends purple or generic, and key beats (the maelstrom, the internal shift) lean on summary rather than sharply etched, scene-level detail. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet tight or distilled enough for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is clear and grammatical but padded by repetition and scaffolding, reasserting the same ideas with slight rephrasing over multiple sentences and paragraphs. Many lines perform single functions (restating that Lyra is defiant, that the club flourishes, that the greenhouse is a sanctuary) rather than carrying layered information. Rhythm is monotonous: similar sentence lengths and structures, with frequent use of summary verbs (“continued to,” “remained,” “became”) that blunt momentum. Clichéd formulations (“unbreakable spirit,” “beacon of hope”) weaken the line-level distinctness expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with some striking images (e.g., thoughts flowing “like a river of moonlight”). However, there is noticeable repetition and paraphrase at line level—her need to transform pain and the postcard’s significance are restated multiple times with similar phrasing. Abstract nouns and mild purple tendencies (“reef-shadow joy,” “soft, ethereal light,” “vast expanse of time”) sometimes displace concrete embodiment. The prose is solid but could be tightened and grounded for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains many pleasing images, yet it frequently loops (“deserted marvels,” “sound of forgotten names,” “opal library”) without adding new information, slowing momentum. Figurative language is stacked densely and sometimes feels like ornament rather than sharpened insight, edging into purple. Several sentences restate similar ideas about purpose, memory, and beauty, which could be compressed for greater force. The final third, in particular, could lose multiple redundant lines without any loss of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often evocative, but it tends toward purple and repetitive, with stacked modifiers and recurring abstract phrases that dilute impact. Many sentences do only atmospheric work without adding new information or pressure, which flattens momentum in what is already a low-conflict piece. Metaphors like “symphonies of truth” and “scent of possibility” are leaned on instead of varied, concrete images of her process or emotional struggle. Trimming paraphrase-like lines and sharpening a few key sensory anchors would markedly improve density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The line-level writing is grammatical and occasionally striking, but weighed down by repetition and purple constructions. Many sentences paraphrase the same emotional state (“resolve deepened,” “sense of belonging,” “tremble with wonder”) without adding new information or pressure. Figurative motifs like the breathing building, dappled shadows, and her “slyly heartfelt warmth” recur without sufficient variation, turning lushness into redundancy. The overall effect is languid and somewhat static, sapping momentum in a story that already has limited plot.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level writing is clean, grammatically sound, and easy to follow, with some nicely framed images (dust motes dancing in light, pigeons’ white feathers). There is noticeable repetition of ideas and phrases (musty paper, balance, paper trails, dust motes) that sometimes feels like paraphrase rather than deliberate patterning. Figurative language such as “a blooming withering” is evocative but occasionally tips toward decorative abstraction. Overall momentum is acceptable for a lyric piece, though tighter cutting of redundant sentences would heighten density.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but there is significant redundancy in construction and idea (repeated assertions of mystery, peace, necessary distances). Figurative language is frequent yet rarely surprising or layered, and abstractions often replace concrete dramatization. Paragraphs near the end paraphrase the same emotional state (“sense of peace,” “new beginnings,” “world was full of mysteries”) without adding pressure or nuance. The overall effect is smooth but prosy and over-explained, lacking the compression and precision expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose contains many near-duplicate sentences and loops that restate the same content (“would stay with them,” “forgotten underwater city research facility,” “shadowseam wonder”), significantly dragging momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent but leans purple, with stacked abstractions (“essence,” “soul,” “hidden rhythms”) crowding out concrete sensory detail. Almost every paragraph could be tightened without loss of meaning, suggesting considerable scaffolding. Line-level craft is serviceable but not at the precision or density expected for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a smooth, readable rhythm and no serious clarity issues. However, it leans toward repetition and mild purple prose: similar sentence openings (“As she…”), recurrent phrases (“cheerful gloom,” “even as memory fades”), and stacked modifiers slightly dilute impact. Many lines do only one job—often atmospheric description—rather than advancing character and stakes simultaneously. Overall craft is competent, but it lacks the compression and precision expected at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatical and readable, with some pleasing images, but leans into mild purple and redundancy (“orchestrated serendipity” and similar phrases recur without adding nuance). Many sentences do only one job—restating his philosophy or the ambiance—so momentum drifts. Metaphors are conventional and sometimes stacked without deepening effect (stars as diamonds on a velvet sky, “celestial ballet”). There are no egregious artifacts, but the line-level craft lacks the compression, surprise, and multi-function density expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clear and readable, with a smooth rhythmic flow and few mechanical errors. There are some pleasing images, but also a tendency toward redundancy and mild purple prose (reiterating her sense of unity and transcendence without adding new angles). Several sentences restate the same emotional state (“she knew…”, “she felt…”) instead of compressing or sharpening. Information density is moderate rather than high, and the line-level never quite surprises or cuts deep enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically sound and easy to follow, but suffers from redundancy and conceptual repetition: similar sentiments about peace, wonder, hidden patterns, and beauty are restated with only minor variations. Figurative language is competent yet often abstract and slightly purple (“noctilucent reckonings,” “clear complexity”) without adding fresh, concrete insight. Many sentences do single duty, telling emotional states rather than layering action, image, and thought, which dulls momentum in an already static piece. Overall line-level craft is serviceable but not sharp or economical enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but weighed down by repetition, paraphrase loops, and clichéd imagery (“twinkled like diamonds,” “velvet expanse,” “silvery glow,” “ethereal glow”). Many sentences restate the same emotional idea with slightly different words, which dilutes momentum and impact. Figurative language is frequent without much variation in vehicle or precision, contributing to a sense of purple haze that blurs rather than sharpens. Line-level economy and textural specificity need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are clear and mostly well-constructed, but there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrasing (“trial balloons,” “vast expanse,” “she knew that she”) that doesn’t add new pressure or detail. The prose leans into abstract, slightly purple formulations (“serene upheaval,” “equations for hope”) without grounding them in fresh, concrete image work. Momentum is gentle but somewhat flat; many lines restate Aria’s purpose or the symbolism of the gauge instead of advancing. While nothing is egregiously muddled, the line-level craft lacks the compression and distinctiveness expected at elite-publication tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Grammar and syntax are clean, but there is heavy paraphrase looping and near-duplicate sentences (e.g., multiple lines reiterating that the estate holds secrets and the cartographer is honored to record them). Many sentences do only one job—restating motivation or theme—rather than layering image, emotion, and action. Repeated structures and stock qualifiers (“it seemed,” “a deep sense of loss and longing”) give the prose a slightly padded, programmatic feel. Information density and rhythmic variety would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally grammatical and readable, but it leans heavily into repetition and synonym loops: ideas about “possibility,” “beyond the veil of reality,” and the parapet’s otherworldly glow recur with minimal new information. Figurative language is frequent yet not always precise, sometimes stacking descriptors (“dusky harmony,” “almost divine,” “otherworldly light”) that blur rather than sharpen the effect. Many sentences restate motivation or atmosphere already established, slowing momentum in a relatively short piece. Line-level tightening and pruning of redundant clauses would significantly increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is grammatically sound and clear, but heavily padded with repetition and abstract phrasing that reduces momentum. Many sentences restate the same ideas—burden, ritual, redemption, celestial dance—without adding new texture or pressure. Figurative language is mild but tends toward the generic and sentimental; line-level information density is low. Trimming repeated concepts and concretizing a few key moments would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, and the prose sustains basic momentum across the scene. There are noticeable paraphrase loops and repeated formulations (“echo of extinct birds,” “barren, cracked expanse,” “brought new life”) that dilute impact. Figurative language is modest and mostly coherent, but some lines lean toward summary and abstraction rather than sharp, image-driven specificity. The closure paragraph reiterates prior ideas instead of delivering a newly condensed, surprising image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some attractive images, but it leans into repetition and abstraction (“weight,” “solace,” “purpose,” “possibility”) that dilute impact. Many sentences restate similar ideas of freedom and burden without adding new texture or pressure, creating a mild sense of thematic looping. Figurative phrases like “harvest of echoes” and “lullaby of conformity” are intriguing yet not always grounded in concrete experience. Line by line, the piece is competent, but the density of lofty diction and near-duplicate sentiments slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is fluent and largely free of technical errors, and many individual sentences are pleasant to read. That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrasing (serenity, meteor hush, sanctuary, mission) without added nuance, creating a looped feel. Figurative language and adjectives tend toward the generalized and mildly purple (“soft, ethereal light,” “half-lit epiphanies,” “magic that could be found in the most unexpected places”). Line-level craft supports mood but offers limited compression, surprise, or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Grammar and mechanics are clean, and individual sentences are generally clear, but there is considerable redundancy at the paragraph level (multiple near-identical assertions of her reverence, purpose, and the grotto’s stillness). Adjectival stacking and phrases like “soft, ethereal light,” “otherworldly light,” and repeated references to sweetness and hum drift toward purple prose without adding new information. Many lines restate theme or mood without advancing situation, which flattens momentum in a short piece. The closure image survives, but the line-level excess would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally offers a striking phrase, and the rhythm is mostly smooth. However, there is significant repetition of ideas and structures, with multiple sentences restating the same emotional or thematic points (her purpose, the sanctum’s energy, the importance of memory). Figurative language and elevated phrasing sometimes feel generic rather than precise, reducing information density. The line-level work is serviceable but not sharp enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some effective sensory images and a steady rhythm. There is noticeable repetition and abstraction (“precisely playful” twice, “paths that chose their walkers” reiterated, concept labels like “grand design” and “larger narrative”) that add mild scaffolding drag. Figurative language is fairly safe and sometimes generic; few lines carry layered information or surprise. Overall, the line-level work supports the piece but doesn’t yet reach the density or precision expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is mechanically clean but weighed down by repetition and abstraction; many sentences restate the same idea with slight variations (“dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion,” “celestial rhythms,” “threshold between worlds”). Figurative language is frequent yet rarely surprising, often leaning on generic cosmic/spiritual imagery (“stardust,” “beacon,” “sacred dance”). Information density is low because key beats (decoding, covenant-making) are summarized rather than rendered in scene. This creates a sense of purple, looping rhetoric rather than sharp, propulsive line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans heavily on repetition and abstraction, with multiple sentences restating similar ideas about harmony, release, and shifting grace. Adjectival phrases (“soft, golden light,” “serene oasis,” “gentle reminder of the power of harmony”) stack without adding much new information, which slows momentum. The central magical beat is narrated in summary (“she began to weave a subtle spell of persuasion…”) rather than textured, concrete action. Line-level craft is competent but not especially compressed or vivid for a high-end literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level writing is grammatically sound and often evocative, with strong sensory anchors like “damp earth and decaying wood.” Yet there is paraphrase and motif looping—especially around frost shimmer, boundary erasure, and glass mountains—that creates mild redundancy without adding pressure. Figurative language is mostly coherent but leans into purple repetition rather than layered development. The piece reads smoothly but could be tightened considerably for density and sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and mostly clear, with some pleasing images (“the air was alive with the soft chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves”). There is a tendency to repeat concepts (deciduous vows, bridging generational wisdom, forgotten bag contents) in similar language, creating mild redundancy. Several sentences lean into exposition and abstraction, which slows momentum and dilutes otherwise strong images. Line-level craft is competent but not yet compressed or precise enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with few grammatical issues and some pleasing images (“blossoms shimmering like stardust”). There is mild redundancy and a tendency toward telling and summary phrasing (“The curator knew that they had stumbled upon something significant”) that could be cut or dramatized. Figurative language is present but not egregiously overstacked; rhythm is somewhat monotone but not mechanically so. Line-level work is solid but lacks the compression and multi-functioning sentences expected at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean, but there is significant redundancy and abstraction, especially in the closing third where phrases like “secrets and mysteries,” “true calling,” and “new world of possibilities” pile up without adding new information. Many sentences restate similar emotional beats (“she realized… she knew… she had found…”) instead of advancing pressure or specificity, which blunts momentum. Figurative language such as “unheard symphony” is repeated without deepening meaning, edging into purple rather than precise. Line-level craft is serviceable but far from the lean, high-density standard of elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and readable, with a generally smooth rhythm, but relies on familiar formulations (“felt a shiver run down her spine,” “sense of peace wash over her”) and repeated constructions (“she knew that she had to…”). Abstraction is frequent (“essence of the tales,” “narrative threads,” “trapped freedom”) without always being grounded in concrete image or action. There’s some light redundancy around Lyra’s determination to follow the threads, but no major loops or figurative muddle. Line-level craft is solid but not yet sharpened to literary-magazine precision.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose is grammatically clean and broadly clear, but leans on repetition and abstractions (“threads,” “mysteries,” “essence”) instead of sharp, concrete images. Many sentences restate similar content—the merging of threads, emerging clarity—without adding new pressure or detail. The mystical beats are described in generalized language, so the climactic moment feels muted rather than vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a consistent lyrical register. However, there are many paraphrase loops and near-duplicate constructions (e.g., reiterating her motivation and the caves’ transformation in similar terms), which dilute momentum. Figurative language is relatively safe and serviceable but not often striking, and key abstractions (“balance,” “serenity,” “sense of purpose”) recur without new texture. Line-level craft supports the concept but does not yet perform at a refined, publish-ready level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatical, smooth, and mostly clear, with some evocative phrases and solid image work. There is mild redundancy (repeated mentions of shard, hope, stillness) and a tendency toward abstract nouns and stock formulations (“sense of awe,” “brighter future”). Figurative language is present but not so dense as to muddy meaning; momentum is gentle but not stalled. Line-level craft is competent and readable but lacks the compression and surprise expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong sensory anchors and few, if any, technical errors. Yet it leans into repetition and abstraction—phrases like “collective memory,” “deepening hush,” and formulations of love/loss/triumph/tragedy recur without adding sharp new facets. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar emotional territory, which softens momentum and density. Overall, it’s above-average line work, but the repetition and lack of sharpened turns keep it below elite craft.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to parse, but suffers from repetition of concepts and phrases (“hopelessness,” “ambient awareness,” “filled with a sense of wonder”) and occasional purple constructions (“defy the gravity of hopelessness”). Many sentences restate the same emotional state with minor variation, which slightly dulls momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not compressed or surprising enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level prose is competent and clear but suffers from significant redundancy and scaffolding—many sentences reiterate nearly identical ideas about stillness, contemplation, or the cicada without adding pressure or new texture. Cadence becomes monotonous through repeated openings and structures, and some phrases read like abstract summary rather than vivid scene. There is mild purple-leaning abstraction (“intricate web of moments,” “mysteries she sought to uncover”) that could be grounded in more concrete, character-particular language. Overall momentum drags, which would not pass at an elite venue without tightening and pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with a smooth cadence and no syntactic confusion or serious artifacts. Some phrases are striking (silences as flavors sprouting like seeds), and information density is decent. There is also repetition of similar abstractions (“essence,” “presence,” “solace and growth”) and summary sentences that restate what the scene already implies, dulling momentum. The language leans a bit conceptual and sentimental rather than sharply concrete at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, and many individual sentences are pleasant, but redundancy and abstraction are recurring problems. Phrases and ideas loop (“catalyze a deeper understanding,” “beauty that lay in silence,” “vaulting hush,” “quiet that followed the train whistle’s echo”) without adding new pressure or image. Figurative language is safe and pastel, occasionally tipping toward purple without sharpening meaning. Line-level craft passes baseline competence but lacks compression and variety expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasantly imagistic (“leaves that shimmered like stardust”), maintaining clarity of action. However, it leans heavily on familiar phrases (“weight of her quest,” “steeled herself,” “sweet scent of blooming flowers”) and a uniform lushness that can blur emphasis. Some sentences reiterate similar sentiments about anticipation, weight, and destiny without adding new information or pressure. The line-level craft is solid but somewhat conventional and occasionally overwritten for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically mostly clean but leans heavily on repetition and abstractions (“essence,” “emptiness,” “sanctuary began to stir,” “loaded emptiness”) rather than concrete, multi-tasking lines. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas (melancholy, isolation, reviving, rebirth) without adding pressure, dulling momentum. Figurative language and high-register phrasing often float free of physical anchors, creating a slightly purple, diffuse texture. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet tight or incisive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is competent, with clear sentences and straightforward sequencing, making the story easy to parse. Some redundancies and minor errors (“an new intensity,” “an sense of possibility”) detract from polish. The prose tends to stack adjectives and abstractions (“incredible,” “astonishing,” “truly remarkable”) instead of letting specific images carry intensity, which dulls impact. There are no major artifacts, but the language could be tightened and made more precise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level writing is competent and occasionally evocative, but heavily redundant and abstract. Phrases like “hidden truth,” “secrets of the universe,” “newfound understanding,” and “power of intuition” recur without adding specificity, creating scaffold-like loops. The prose leans toward purple—stacked modifiers and elevated diction—without always earning them through concrete image work or pressure. This repetition and abstraction significantly dulls momentum and undercuts the impact of the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but heavily repetitive: similar sentence structures and reiterated phrases (“murmured allegiance,” “shape of possibility,” “mystical energies”) create a sense of looped scaffolding. Figurative language is serviceable but leans purple and abstract, often restating the same emotional state in slightly different words. Momentum sags because many sentences advance atmosphere without adding new information or pressure. Line-level craft is functional but needs tightening and more varied rhythm for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is generally grammatical but weighed down by repetition and abstraction—“testament,” “sanctuary,” “resilience,” “power of the human heart” recur without adding precision. Many sentences restate the same emotional point (sorrow becoming hope) in slightly different terms, creating a paraphrase loop and sapping momentum. Figurative language tends toward the generic (“unfolded like a flower,” “pushing back against the darkness”) rather than fresh, sensory images. Line-level craft feels more like a competent draft than refined literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with some pleasing phrases (“auric lagoon,” “tyranny of indifference”) but also frequent repetition of concepts and structures. Abstract language and stacked modifiers sometimes dilute immediacy, and several sentences paraphrase each other rather than adding new pressure or image. Rhythm is generally smooth but borders on monotonous because of similar sentence shapes and reiterated motifs. Line-level craft is solid yet not sharp or economical enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose leans into overwriting and repetition: many sentences restate that the music soothes, the mist swirls, and the grotto glows with only minor variation. Figurative density is high without much sharpening effect, and several metaphors are generic (“haunting reminder,” “place of mystery and beauty”). Paragraphs often add little new information, dragging momentum. Line-level craft is competent in mechanics but undercut by loops and redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains some lovely images, but it leans heavily on repetitive constructions and adjective stacks (“mystical, otherworldly place,” “soft, ethereal radiance”), which dilute impact. Several sentences paraphrase each other’s content—the arbor’s magic and her transformation are restated rather than deepened. Occasional grammatical slips and the reliance on stock formulations (“magic that lay just beneath the surface”) further blunt momentum. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet at elite-publication precision or economy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Line-level craft is mostly clean, with clear sentences and a steady rhythm, but there is noticeable redundancy and some purple-leaning abstraction (“the power of uncertainty,” “world seemed full of possibility”). Several sentences repeat ideas with slight variation without adding pressure or new detail, especially around calm/clarity/possibility. Figurative density is moderate and usually coherent, though sometimes a bit generic. Tightening loops and replacing vague emotional labels with sharper, concrete images would significantly strengthen momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally clear, but it leans heavily on abstraction and repetition, with many paraphrase loops (“beauty in the brokenness, and the stories that the flaws told” echoed multiple times). Figurative language often reiterates the same concepts (“intricate dance,” “web of connections”) without adding precision, which dulls momentum. Key paragraphs could be cut or compressed without materially changing situation or emotional charge, indicating scaffold and filler. While there are no glaring grammatical errors, line-level craft does not yet meet elite, publishable density.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some effective images (“misaligned harp,” “luminous ache”). There is noticeable repetition of structures and concepts (“sense of…”, “her footsteps quiet on the damp earth,” mist swirling) that could be compressed for higher impact. Figurative language remains safe and occasionally generic, never quite surprising or multi-layered. Momentum holds, but line-level density and variation would need tightening for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level prose is generally clean and grammatical, with a straightforward rhythm that keeps the story moving. There is some redundancy and stock phrasing (“taste of fear and adrenaline,” repetition of “ultraviolet forest” and “pulsing light”) that could be tightened for greater density. The climax in the clearing is mostly told in abstract terms, which blunts its impact and reads slightly like scaffolding. Still, there are no severe artifacts or muddled metaphors, just a tendency toward summary and generic intensifiers where specificity would elevate the work.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically sound and generally clear, with occasional striking phrases (“a fragment of a lighthouse lens, its crystal facets glinting like a shard of moonlight”). However, there is substantial repetition and paraphrase—many sentences restate Lena’s purpose and the market’s mystery in similar abstract terms. Figurative language leans toward the purple and interchangeable (“eternal instant,” “boundless expanse of possibility and discovery,” “secrets that lay just beyond the edge of perception”), which blurs impact. Line-level tightening and more concrete, non-redundant images would markedly improve momentum and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, but there is noticeable redundancy in both diction and concept (“weightless burden,” “cracks in the façade,” and variations on “forgotten dreams” reappear without adding pressure). Many lines restate similar emotional content instead of advancing character or situation, creating a faint looping feel. Figurative language occasionally edges toward purple and self-conscious (“as if the very darkness itself is being drawn into the narrative”). The prose works at a basic level but would need tightening and sharpening to meet elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatically sound, and capable of striking images (the bottled whisper “in a viscous liquid that seemed to slow its vibrations,” the clouds’ “tentative fingers”). However, there is considerable repetition of sentence patterns and conceptual restatement (e.g., multiple variants of “the operator knew” and “it was said that”), which blunts momentum. Figurative language verges on purple in places but does not quite tip into muddle; clarity is maintained. Tightening loops and trimming redundant phrases would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clear and grammatically clean, with some appealing images (time as a shimmering mantle, galleries like a labyrinth). There is noticeable redundancy and scaffolding—ideas like sorrow, reimagining, rediscovering, and her transformation are reiterated in slightly varied language rather than advanced. Figurative language leans purple in places and rarely surprises; several sentences could be tightened without loss. Nonetheless, momentum is not badly obscured, and line-level issues don’t damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, and many sentences carry atmosphere effectively. Yet there is a tendency toward purple abstraction and repetition—phrases like “mending what wasn’t torn,” “reclaim the light stolen by midnight,” and “tinkersong wonder” recur without always adding new layers. Figurative density sometimes substitutes for specificity of action, blunting momentum. Trimming redundancies and grounding key beats in sharper concrete detail would significantly strengthen line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally grammatical and readable, with some appealing images (“resonant hush,” “unfolding its secrets like a lotus flower”), but leans into repetition and abstraction. Many sentences recycle stems (“As she…,” “She felt…,” “The compass…”), and ideas are paraphrased rather than advanced, creating a sense of spinning in place. Figurative language clusters (“very fabric of reality,” “subtle frequencies,” “becoming one”) verge on purple and blur specificity. Momentum suffers in the middle as description and interior summary reiterate the same emotional note.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and flows smoothly, but it leans heavily on similar sentence structures and repeated conceptual phrasing (“hidden patterns and connections,” “intricate web”). Many sentences restate the same idea in slightly different language, diluting momentum and density. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid purple overload, yet abstraction and nominalizations (“significance,” “motivation,” “complexity”) crowd out concrete, sensory beats. With tighter cutting and more specific, varied imagery, the line-level work could rise significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from paraphrase loops and repetition of concepts and phrasing (quiet contemplation, mysteries, understanding, beauty of the night) without adding new information. Many sentences do the same job—asserting Luna’s deepening insight—rather than advancing character, situation, or image in tandem. Figurative language is serviceable but leans toward the purple and abstract, reducing sharpness. Line-level tightening and a demand for fresher, more concrete image-work would be necessary for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is competent and readable, with clear syntax and no major grammatical problems, but leans heavily on repetition and scaffold phrases (“she felt,” “she knew,” “as she”) that sap momentum. Several sentences restate the same idea—Naomi is drawn to the place, feels a connection, is driven by truth—without adding new pressure or image. Figurative language is sparse and safe rather than fresh, and there’s some mild purple tendency in stacked abstractions near the ending. Tightening redundancy and grounding feelings in specific actions would materially improve line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but there is substantial repetition of ideas (“daunting” task vs. “undaunted” alchemist, multiple restatements of revival/rebirth) without added nuance. Many sentences do only one job and circle the same abstractions—“vision,” “task,” “revival,” “reimagine”—creating a low-key paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Imagery is serviceable but leans on familiar phrases (“breathed new life,” “reborn from the ashes”) rather than sharply particular language. Line-level craft is functional but not yet tight or surprising enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level writing is grammatically sound and easy to follow, but there is considerable redundancy in both structure and content (“The velvet disquiet…”, “The emotional patterns…” recurring without new pressure). Many sentences perform a single function and could be compressed to increase momentum and density. Figurative language is mostly safe, yet the accumulation of similar atmospheric statements flattens impact instead of deepening it. The result is pleasant but somewhat padded prose, not yet cut to literary sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, with a cohesive, almost incantatory cadence. Yet it leans into repetition and abstraction—phrases like “sense of purpose,” “delicate balance,” “mysterious legacy,” and “infinite possibilities” recur without adding new texture, generating a mild paraphrase-loop effect. Concrete sensory detail thins out as the piece progresses, so the emotional and conceptual peaks feel told rather than sharply imaged.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to parse, but it leans heavily on repetitive constructions (“As she… Ember would…”) and paraphrased sentiments that could be compressed or dramatized. Many sentences restate similar ideas about listening, subtle rhythms, and microclimate variations without adding new texture or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and safe, and key insights are told in abstract terms rather than embodied in fresh images. The line-level craft is competent but lacks the compression, precision, and rhythmic control expected for immediate elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some pleasant cadences and a steady tone. However, there are many paraphrase loops and near-duplicate ideas (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance,” “beauty of the cosmos,” “strength in vulnerability”) that add bulk without new information. Abstraction dominates over concrete sensory detail, which dulls momentum and emotional immediacy. Line-level craft is competent but not sharp or economical enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clear and mostly grammatically clean, with some effective images (“a haunting echo of what had been lost,” the glowing stained glass box in darkness). Yet there is significant repetition in sentence stems and concepts (eyes, gaze, ghosts gathering and dispersing, “weight of unspoken words”), and several lines paraphrase the same emotional content without adding new information. Figurative language tends toward familiar constructions and can feel padded, which slows momentum in what is already a low-conflict scene. Line-level craft is serviceable and occasionally evocative, but not tightly edited or sharply varied.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean but burdened by repetition and scaffold (“As the days turned into an endless present…”, “The timekeeper’s story was far from over…”). Many adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different words, slowing momentum and diluting impact. Modifiers like “palpable,” “poignant,” “profound,” and “beacon of hope” tend toward vague, quasi-lyric commentary rather than sharp image. Line-level craft does not yet meet the density and precision expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose is grammatical and sometimes lovely, but it suffers from repetition and purple density: similar motifs and sentence rhythms recur with little new information (“a soothing melody that seemed to harmonize…” appears twice in spirit). Many sentences restate prior content in slightly different words, which saps momentum. Figurative language is frequent and fairly generic, with limited variety in cadence. Line-level tightening and sharper, more surprising imagery would be required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clean at the sentence level, but heavily repetitive in diction and structure, recycling phrases like “gently systematic approach,” “brazen calm,” “a reminder,” and similar cadences. Large swaths paraphrase earlier information (legacy, interspecies respect, copper wire effects) without adding new texture or tension, which flattens momentum. The summary mode (“As the weeks turned into months…”, “As the days passed…”) undercuts immediacy around crucial beats like decline and approaching death. Information density is moderate, but much of it is thematic restatement rather than fresh scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatical and readable, and some phrases (“bronze quiet,” “rainwashed tower”) have a pleasing texture. Yet the prose leans into repetition and abstraction—similar beats about anticipation, serenity, and mystery recur without adding pressure or new facets. Many lines restate the same state (“air was filled with…,” “sense of stillness…,” “air was heavy with the promise…”) rather than advancing story or character. This creates a mild looped, purple quality that dulls momentum and the impact of the closing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but weighed down by redundancy and template phrasing (e.g., repeated mentions of “sweet scent of blooming flowers,” similar sentence openings, and recap-like sentences). Many lines restate the same idea—peace, rebirth, harmony—without adding new image or nuance, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is safe and generic; almost no line does more than one job. Rhythm remains monotone, without acceleration, compression, or sharp cuts to highlight key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean, readable, and mostly concise, with a smooth rhythm and minimal scaffolding or repetition. Occasional phrases verge on purple or vague abstraction (“translate distance into closeness,” “intuitively descriptive of something he couldn't quite grasp”) without adding concrete pressure. Description is sometimes redundant across sentences (e.g., several lines reiterating the wasteland’s desolation and the spring’s miraculous nature). Nonetheless, clarity is maintained and the closure image is not obscured by line-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lines are generally clear, but there is substantial redundancy and scaffold (“the stars twinkling like diamonds” appears twice; the deck’s stillness is reiterated in multiple near-synonymous formulations). Figurative language leans purple and familiar, and several sentences do single, easily compressible jobs. The closing paragraphs in particular loop ideas (stillness → movement, silence → possibility) without adding new texture or cost, softening impact. Overall, prose is serviceable but not at a polished-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are grammatical and readable, and the rhythm is generally smooth, but there is noticeable repetition of structures and modifiers (“cautious abandon,” “sense of wonder,” “deep breath,” “deepening to a rich, burnished hue”). Several lines paraphrase each other in close proximity, especially around mission setup and resolution, reducing information density. Figurative language is safe and occasionally purple (“very essence of the stars”) but doesn’t collapse into muddle. Overall the prose is competent and pleasant but not yet sharpened for maximum precision or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with some pleasing phrases. There is noticeable repetition of key formulations (“luminous absence,” “unbind the past,” “historian of small gestures”) that feels more like hammering than deepening. Abstraction often replaces concrete, multi-sensory specificity, giving the piece a slightly hazy, same-texture feel. Still, there are no major loops, muddled metaphors, or rhythm failures that impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose shows care at the line level, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory detail. However, it tends toward purple: stacked modifiers, repeated intensifiers, and slightly redundant phrases (“labyrinthine bookstore,” “air was thick… a heady aroma”) slow momentum without adding pressure. Figurative language appears frequently and sometimes lapses into vagueness or pseudo-profundity (“reality that substitutes reality nightly”) rather than sharpening image or stakes. Clarity survives, but tighter, more selective lines would improve impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and mostly clear, with some strong images (e.g., “threads of time weaving themselves back together”). Yet figurative language and abstractions are overused, leading to a sense of sameness and mild purple prose, especially in the middle and closing paragraphs. Several sentences restate similar ideas about hush, redemption, and peace without adding new information or pressure. The final third, in particular, leans on generalized summary rather than sharp, specific images to embody the change.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose often lapses into repetition and near-paraphrase—multiple sentences reiterate the power of art, the looming ritual, and the price of forgiveness without adding new texture or pressure. Figurative language is frequent but not always precise or fresh, and stacked modifiers (“pale spire that rose, enigmatic and still”; “a poem of forgiveness and doubt, of truth and uncertainty”) can blur impact. Momentum suffers in the middle and ending, where thematic restatements accumulate instead of sharpening or complicating earlier images. Line-level craft is competent but would require tightening and pruning to meet elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.0)
    Grammar and syntax are clean, but the prose shows clear paraphrase loops and redundancy: multiple sentences reiterate the workshop’s creaking, the sea’s churning, the “edge of oblivion,” and the kintsugi intentions without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language trends purple and generalized (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion,” “words spilling from her lips like a prayer”) rather than precise, and these phrases recur, diluting impact. Sentence openings and structures are often similar, creating a drumbeat that slows momentum, especially in what should be high-pressure breath-holding moments. Line-level craft is functional but far from the concision and multi-function density expected at an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatical and clear, and the piece is easy to follow line by line. There is noticeable redundancy in both syntax and concept (“bringing the scene to life with vivid colors and textures” appears essentially twice; “temporary eternity” and “fragile and profound” recur without deepening), and some phrases verge on purple without adding new information. Many sentences do only one job, explaining what the previous one already implied, which slows momentum in a short form. Tightening and more selective imagery would significantly raise the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose offers some strong images (the light as a “gentle whisper,” the garden’s “heady mix of blooming flowers and fresh earth”) and mostly clean grammar. Yet it frequently lapses into abstraction and repetition—“vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness,” and similar phrases recur without adding new nuance—creating a sense of purple, padded texture. Many sentences restate the same idea about intent and connection, reducing information density and momentum. The line-level craft is serviceable but overornamented for the amount of actual turn on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean at the level of grammar and basic clarity, and paragraphing is straightforward. However, there is noticeable repetition of phrases and ideas (“raw solace,” “starlit signal station,” rebuilding from fragments) without added nuance, leading to a sense of paraphrase loops. Much of the language is abstract rather than concrete, which dulls momentum and emotional intensity. Sentences often do only one job (telling us what she feels or intends) instead of carrying layered image, action, and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentences are grammatical and clear, but there’s considerable redundancy and scaffold (“The forager realized… The forager’s motivation…”), with multiple lines rephrasing the same insight. Prose leans heavily on abstractions and nominalizations instead of concrete, multi-tasking images, which flattens momentum. Rhythm stays fairly uniform, with long, similarly structured sentences that reduce dynamic tension. There are a few striking phrases, but not enough compression or precision for elite-line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some evocative lines and a steady lyric tone. However, there is notable repetition and scaffolding: concepts like “mist,” “witnessed isolation,” and the weight/complexity of memories are reiterated in similar phrasing without adding new facets. Several sentences paraphrase each other’s content, especially around Kael’s realizations and the significance of the boutonnière, slightly dragging momentum. The language does its job but would need tightening and more varied texture for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically sound and clear, but heavily reliant on repetition of structures (“As the creek…”, “The [object], now…”) and abstract summary. Many sentences restate similar ideas about journey, promise, and discovery without adding new information, which dulls momentum and impact. Figurative language is sparse but the descriptive lexicon is also limited, leading to a slightly monotonous texture. Line-level craft is functional rather than sharp, with few moments of compressed, multi-layered phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking (“sea of clouds…like an endless, shimmering expanse of silk”), but it’s heavily overwritten and looped. Many adjacent sentences restate similar content with synonyms (“living, breathing entity, pulsing with a malevolent energy,” followed by “sense of lacy menace…darkness itself was watching her”), diluting momentum. Intensifiers (“as if,” “seemed,” “sense of”) recur so often that they hedge rather than sharpen images. Metaphors sometimes clash or feel imprecise (“a shared exhale that seemed to spot the first fireflies”), undercutting clarity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often vivid, with some strong sensory lines (“the distant tang of salt,” “a palette of resolve”). Yet many sentences repeat similar ideas with slight variation, particularly around her fascination, connection, and revaluation of the shell, which creates a mild sense of looped scaffold. Abstract noun clusters and coined phrases occasionally drift toward purple without adding new information or pressure. Line-level craft is solid but not taut or surprising enough for immediate top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean, but it suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy—multiple sentences restate the same ideas about writing, nostalgia, and dreams with slightly varied wording. Abstract nouns and stock formulations (“a jumble of images and emotions,” “a sense of wonder”) dilute impact, and concrete, surprising detail is scarce. Rhythm is relatively flat, with many similar-length sentences and repeated openings that dampen momentum. The final third continues in the same register instead of tightening or sharpening the language to crystallize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and flow smoothly, but they frequently repeat concepts with slight variation—“ordinary miracles,” “hidden patterns,” “trembling calm,” and her motivation are restated without added pressure. The prose leans on abstract nouns and thematic labels instead of concrete, multi-tasking images, which flattens momentum. While not purple, the language sometimes feels padded and self-reiterative, especially in the final third. Tighter cutting and more specific, embodied phrasing would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with a smooth, meditative rhythm and some well-chosen sensory notes (sandalwood, scratching quill). However, there’s noticeable repetition of abstractions (“mystical forces,” “stillness,” “tranquility,” “whispers”) and a tendency to restate similar ideas (calm/stillness between storms; scars into stories) without adding pressure or specificity. Figurative language stays safe and sometimes generic, and the line-level density occasionally feels padded rather than sharply necessary. Overall, it’s competent but not yet razor-honed for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some effective images (the humming bottle “like the reverberation of a harp string,” the orchard’s hush) and solid sensory grounding. At the same time, there’s repetition of concepts (“imperfect miracles,” “ethereal beauty,” “intricate patterns”) and a tendency toward abstraction and summary of belief. Many sentences do similar atmospheric work without adding new pressure or nuance, which slightly dulls momentum. It’s competent and occasionally lovely, but not yet ruthlessly precise or formally surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is smooth and readable, and some images—the shelves as sentinels, the universe’s hiccup—are effective. Still, there is considerable repetition in structure and content (“As she…”, “The world/universe…”, “In the silence…”) and a tendency toward vague abstractions instead of concrete detail. Many sentences restate the same idea of inward/outward journey and growing clarity with slightly different wording, which saps momentum. The language stops short of purple, but it does drift into airy generality and occasional redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level craft is grammatically clean but hampered by heavy repetition and paraphrase loops, with multiple sentences restating the same ideas about duty, counting, and serenity. Information density is low; many lines could be cut without changing knowledge or emotional charge. Figurative language is sparse but generally safe; the main issue is monotony of structure and concept rather than purple prose. This drains momentum and dulls what should be the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and sometimes evocative, especially in describing light and atmosphere, but it suffers from repetition and abstraction: similar sentiments about understanding, interconnectedness, and revolutionizing perception recur with minor variations. Many sentences do single, expository jobs instead of layering image, emotion, and action, which dulls momentum. Phrases like “quiet wildfire within her burning brighter” edge toward purple and feel interchangeable with other metaphors on the page. Line-level craft is competent but not yet lean or sharp enough for high-end literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a steady, readable rhythm. There is noticeable paraphrase and repetition (the lantern glowing with “new significance,” “soft, ethereal light,” her resolve and determination reiterated), which bloats the final third and dulls impact. Figurative language stays tame and literal; aside from “clover melancholy,” there’s little risk, but also limited precision or compression. Line by line, many sentences carry only one job (restating mood or intent) rather than advancing character, setting, and stakes simultaneously, which keeps momentum modest.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and the atmospheric language generally works. Yet there is obvious paraphrase looping and near-duplicate sentences about the hum, the haunting music, the loop of calls, and the operator’s role, which dilutes impact. Many lines do only one job—restating concept rather than advancing image, emotion, or situation—so momentum feels flat. With tighter compression and more varied syntax and imagery, the same material could carry more power.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it leans heavily on repetition and paraphrased ideas instead of high-density lines that do multiple jobs. Many sentences restate the same concepts (preservation, power of love, legacy) with only minor lexical shifts, creating a sense of scaffolding and looped emphasis. Imagery is often abstract or stock (“ethereal glow,” “poignant reminder”) rather than sharply particular. Rhythm and sentence variety are adequate but not actively shaped to modulate tension or emphasis.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean at the level of grammar and basic clarity, but it leans heavily on abstraction and repeated phrasing (“sense of community,” “the atmosphere began to shift,” “the very fabric of reality”) instead of fresh, concrete turns. Many adjacent sentences paraphrase each other, especially in the middle where the crowd’s transformation is summarized in multiple similar ways. Figurative language tends toward the generic or overblown (e.g., “like a gentle virus,” “the very fabric of reality was beginning to shift”) without adding precision. Overall momentum suffers from these loops and from the lack of sharply etched, specific images in key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lines are grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some effective images (tattoos shifting to reflect plant language, constellations as a pause in reality). There is noticeable repetition in sentence stems (“The mapmaker’s…”), key phrases (“quiet blaze,” “constellations”), and concept restatements that could be trimmed for sharpness. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent, skirting purple without fully tipping over; information density is moderate but not taut. Momentum is serviceable for a lyric piece but lacks the compression and precision expected at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with no major artifacts or confusion. That said, there is heavy reliance on repetitive structures (“a sense that…,” “a strange comfort,” “a sense that she was on the right path”) and abstract phrasing over concrete imagery. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea in slightly different words, which slightly dulls momentum. Line-level craft is solidly functional but lacks compression and vividness expected at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-by-line craft is grammatically clean but weighed down by repetition and scaffolding: many sentences restate prior ideas with slightly different wording (e.g., multiple iterations of translating silence into music, orchestrating moonlight, joyful sorrow). Figurative language leans on familiar formulations without sharpening sense, which blurs rather than intensifies key beats. Momentum sags because almost every sentence performs the same job—reasserting mood or theme—rather than layering new information or pressure. The closure image is clear enough, but the path there feels padded and somewhat overwritten for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some pleasing phrases, but it suffers from repetition in both structure and content (“testament,” “power of art,” “forgotten promise,” “trail of artistic creations”). Many sentences restate similar ideas about art, memory, and testimony without adding new pressure or image, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is relatively restrained but trends toward vague uplift rather than specific, surprising detail. Line-level craft is functional yet not sharp enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans into repetition and abstraction, with many sentences restating similar ideas (connection, shared dream, entangled memories, auric lagoon) with slight lexical variation. Figurative language (“auroral sorrow,” “the hush of the universe inhaling/exhaling”) is frequent, often untethered to concrete action, leading to a softness of impact and some purple overtones. Information density is modest; several paragraphs could be compressed without loss of meaning or emotional charge. Rhythm is relatively flat—similar sentence structures and repeated clause patterns reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and mostly economical, with clear sentence construction and no major grammatical or logical errors. Some phrases and images are mildly repetitive (“labyrinth,” “containers”) and a few abstractions (“a different kind of energy was building”) blunt specificity. Still, most lines do at least one job, and the rhythm is readable without obvious template-cadence artifacts. The language is workmanlike rather than striking, but it does not significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some appealing images. However, there is substantial redundancy (“stillwater tension,” “silent empathy,” and similar constructions recur without adding new nuance), and several sentences restate the same idea. Figurative language tends toward vague mystical abstraction (“within the edge of a half-spoken secret”) rather than concrete compression. The overall effect is readable but padded, without the tightness expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean, but there is significant repetition of concepts and phrasing (“humble rebellion,” “amplified quiet,” “sense of purpose,” “second thoughts”) without new pressure or nuance. Much is told in broad strokes instead of being made concrete, which flattens momentum and emotional impact. Figurative language sometimes edges into purple or vague (“cradling the weight of the world in his mind,” “air thick with the scent of second thoughts”) without grounding detail. The prose sustains mood but does so at the cost of precision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally smooth and grammatical, with a readable rhythm and some striking images (lotus blooming in darkness, glow over the fringe). It veers toward purple and redundant in places, reiterating the same concepts with similar wording (“freedom,” “true nature,” “essence of the sea”) instead of layering new specifics. Figurative language clusters densely but mostly stays coherent; the cost is more a softening of momentum than outright confusion. Trimming repetition and abstract phrasing would sharpen impact without sacrificing lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a steady rhythm that suits a reflective piece. That said, it leans on repetition and abstraction—phrases like “poignant reminder,” “testament,” “legacy,” “emotional void,” and “enduring power of art” recur or echo in tone, producing a mild sense of scaffolding. Several sentences paraphrase similar sentiments about loss, memory, and transformation without adding new concrete detail. The line-level craft is solid but not especially compressed or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains striking phrases (“lantern-moth hush,” “canvas of white silk”) and a strong ear for cadence, but it is over-saturated with modifiers and similar metaphorical moves. Many sentences restate the same idea of art, transformation, or dissolving boundaries in slightly varied language, which slows momentum. Figurative density often overwhelms concrete action, blurring impact instead of sharpening it. Tightening redundancy and varying texture would significantly lift the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, but there is substantial repetition of structure and content (“The painter…”, “The courtyard…”, “As he worked…”), creating a droning rhythm. Many lines restate previous information with slight variation (“The concept of bartered awakenings had taken root…” followed by more explanation of the same), which dulls momentum. Figurative language is sparse but safe; the few images that might be striking (reed tongue, phoenix) aren’t leveraged at the line level. Overall, the prose is serviceable but neither compressed nor particularly vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is smooth at the sentence level but highly repetitive in both diction and concept (“texture of connection,” “laboratory,” “golden light/shadows,” “journey” recur without new pressure). Many adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas, which saps momentum in such a short piece. The explicit “to meet the word count” line reads as scaffolding and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and fluent, but it relies on repetitive constructions and abstract phrasing (“sense of,” “a reminder that,” “they knew that they would continue to create”). Many sentences reiterate the same idea—grief turning into beauty or purpose—without adding new pressure or image, creating a low-grade paraphrase loop. Figurative language is mild but occasionally drifts toward purple without sharpening insight. Overall, line-level craft is solid but padded, with room for tightening and more concrete, specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, but suffers from redundancy and a limited palette of motifs and phrases. Many sentences rephrase the same idea—her curiosity, commitment, inherited mystery, and the loft as threshold—without adding new pressure or texture, creating a sense of looped content. Figurative language is safe but generic, leaning on repeated abstractions (“mystery,” “patterns,” “hidden narratives”) rather than fresh, concrete images. This level of repetition and abstraction would likely be trimmed heavily by a demanding editor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, and images like the bronze prism pagoda catching twilight are vivid. Yet there is noticeable repetition (“anguished joy,” “atoms of nostalgia,” restated transformation) and a tendency toward purple or abstract diction that adds little incremental information. Many sentences summarize interior shifts instead of advancing scene-level pressure, which slows momentum. Line by line it’s competent and readable, but not yet as lean, precise, or energetically varied as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally smooth, grammatical, and often beautiful, with strong sensory and atmospheric choices. Yet it leans into purple repetition and abstract phrasing (“shape of hope,” “luminous regret,” “softly deliberate”) without always adding new information, which softens momentum. Many sentences do similar work—reasserting the same mood and stakes—rather than advancing pressure or specificity. Line-level craft is solid but not razor-honed for maximal impact in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.0)
    The line-level writing is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, but it leans heavily on repeated constructions and metaphors (shedding layers, shimmering stillness, reconstruction) without new facets. Many adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea—Lena questioning, then reconstructing, then reshaping her convictions—creating a sense of looped scaffolding. Figurative language stacks up (“crucible,” “glass vessel,” “sculpture,” “river”) in ways that blur focus rather than sharpen it. Momentum is modest; the prose rarely cuts or surprises, contributing to a static feel.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with a steady rhythm and some strong images (luminescent leaves like “ethereal fingers,” earth as a “reluctant confidant”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of structures (“As they…” openings, parallel “The silence was…”), and several phrases drift into generic or purple territory (“meteor hush,” “weight of the universe,” “boundless sea”) without adding precision. Information density is decent, but sentence-level variety and metaphor sharpness could be tightened for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a consistent cadence and some evocative images, and it reads smoothly aloud. However, there’s notable repetition of concepts and phrases (multiple variations on “a testament to the enduring power of love/emotion,” reused “lingering”/“unused love”), and many sentences restate the same point in slightly different language. Figurative language is frequent but not always doing new work, edging toward purple in places without deepening sense or pressure. Trimming redundancy and sharpening a few metaphors would materially increase density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically smooth, but heavily overwritten: similar images and phrases recur with minimal new information (stardust, whispers, magic, celestial dance) across adjacent sentences. Figurative density often outpaces narrative movement, creating paraphrase loops and blurring urgency. This purple-leaning style slows momentum and softens the impact of the otherwise well-chosen closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clean and grammatical, with strong sensory images and a coherent rhythm. Yet key phrases and constructions repeat without adding new pressure (“fractured lullaby,” “sparks,” “unlit corners,” glowing/shimmering/blooming dune), creating a mild sense of synonym churn and flattening momentum. Some lines drift toward purple or abstract without concrete grounding, especially around the archive’s power. The line-level work is solid but not yet lean or surprising enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.0)
    Line-level craft is serviceable but hampered by significant repetition and paraphrase loops: many sentences restate that he walks, listens to the wind, feels at home, and that the rainforest is mechanical and wondrous. The cadence becomes monotonous with similar sentence openings and structures, which flattens momentum. Abstract phrasing (“probable miracles,” “boundaries between reality and dreams blur”) appears without fresh, grounding image-work. Trimming redundancy and sharpening images would substantially raise the prose quality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasant, with some effective images like “a veiled ridgeway unwound like a serpent” and the glowing star stamps. At the same time, there is notable repetition of concepts and phrases (courage, journey, gentle persistence, shoreline lullaby), creating mild paraphrase loops. Abstraction (“reservoir of strength,” “otherworldly energy”) frequently substitutes for specific sensory or emotional detail, which softens impact. Line-level craft is competent but not yet lean or sharp enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but it overuses similar constructions and thematic words (“silence,” “cost,” “sense,” “felt a sense”) in paraphrase loops. Many sentences restate prior ideas with slight variation, which dilutes momentum in such a short piece. Figurative language is mild rather than egregiously purple, yet the reliance on abstractions over concrete action lowers information density. The closing paragraphs especially could be tightened substantially without loss of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and occasionally pleasing, but there is significant repetition of structures and concepts (“As the…”, “The titan’s…”, reiterated urgency, shifting constellations) that creates a droning rhythm. Many lines state similar stakes or atmosphere without adding new information, which flattens momentum. Figurative language leans toward stock (“eyes, like two glittering stars,” “lost in the mists of time”) and the prose often tells us tone directly (“The tone of the moment was one of graceful collapse”). Tightening redundancy and relying more on concrete, specific images would markedly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and the sentences generally carry multiple functions (image, theme, character). However, there is noticeable repetition at the line level—“rhythms,” “eternal,” “mystery,” “whisper secrets,” and similar constructions recur without always adding new pressure or nuance. Some sentences paraphrase the same idea in slightly different words, contributing to a sense of mild loop and overstatement rather than distilled intensity. Overall, it’s solid, functional lyricism with some purple lean but no fatal muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and readable, with few outright errors and some effective images (“thunderous serenity,” “margin of daylight”). However, there is considerable repetition of ideas and phrases (the hum, the margin of daylight, rediscovering purpose) without new information, which introduces a mild sense of looped narration. Figurative language borders on purple in places and could be pruned for concision and sharper impact. Line-level craft is competent but not yet compressed or surprising enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasant, but it leans heavily on repetition (plants whispering, golden light, destiny, connection) and stacked modifiers that verge on purple (“primordial aroma that stirred something deep within her,” “implanted destiny unfolding within her”). Many sentences do only one job, paraphrasing adjacent ones and slightly dulling momentum. Rhythm remains relatively uniform, with few sharp, concise beats to cut through the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally fluent and occasionally striking (“blue-gray silk,” “pearl of stillness”), and sentences are grammatically clean. However, there is noticeable repetition of structures and concepts (peace “settling,” trees “reaching out,” the world “slowing”) and some purple/therapy-tinged phrasing that blunts impact. A leaner line-level pass cutting redundant sentiments and tempering the metaphors would significantly sharpen momentum and force.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is largely grammatical and clear, with some strong images (tomes humming with otherworldly energy, threads revealing hidden patterns). At the same time, it frequently circles the same ideas with near-synonymous phrasing, especially in the final third, which dilutes momentum. Figurative language and abstractions are dense enough to verge on purple, with motifs (darkness, fragments, luminescence) reiterated more than deepened. Line-level tightening—cutting repetition and sharpening a few metaphors—would markedly improve impact.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it suffers from redundancy and scaffolding: many sentences restate similar ideas (e.g., ink patterns fading, serenity/uncertainty, the drone’s constancy) without adding pressure. The descriptive register tends toward the blandly lyrical, with repeated structures and some near-stock phrasing (“their mind racing with the implications,” “a small, enigmatic smile”). Momentum is gentle but often flat, with limited compression or multi-purpose lines. Line-level craft is competent but not yet sharp or economical enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally smooth and grammatical, with some pleasing rhythmic variation and vivid images. At the same time, there is noticeable repetition and scaffolding—multiple sentences restate that the truths are dangerous, contraband, or conversation-provoking without adding new pressure. Abstract phrases like “bravely conflicted heart” and “dangerous liaison letter” recur as labels rather than being grounded in fresh, concrete detail. The overall effect is readable but slightly padded and occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but there is substantial repetition of structure (“As she worked…,” “The sword…,” “In the glass-domed enclosure…”) and concept, leading to a droning rhythm. Many lines restate the same idea (oasis of peace, rejection of sword, engraved quiet) with slight variation, reducing momentum and density. Figurative phrases are occasionally vivid but overused, edging toward purple without adding new facets. Tighter cutting and more varied syntax would sharpen impact considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some pleasing phrases (“sleepwalking constellations,” “feral lullaby”). There is noticeable repetition and paraphrase (“as the night wore on,” multiple near-identical mentions of patterns breaking and boundaries blurring) that could be tightened. Figurative language remains within bounds and doesn’t become incoherent, but much of it reiterates the same idea instead of layering new nuance. Line-level craft is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet sharp or economical enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sentences are grammatically sound, but there is substantial paraphrase looping: many lines restate Adelaide’s determination, the weight of legacy, mist-as-secrecy, and truth-seeking with minimal new information. Abstract nouns and stock formulations (“overwhelming need to break free,” “sense of purpose,” “no matter the cost”) dominate over concrete, specific action, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than vivid, and repeated motifs feel more like padding than intensification. Overall density is modest for the word count, leaving the piece feeling longer than its actual length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is smooth, grammatically clean, and rhythmically even, with some strong images (“the shadows…twisting and writhing like living things”). However, there is noticeable repetition of structures and concepts (guilt, dissonance, peace) without new pressure, and some stock phrases (“weight of her guilt lift,” “newfound peace”). Figurative language occasionally trends toward purple or generalized, doing less work than it could to differentiate beats. Line-level craft is solid but could be tightened for density and fresher metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, with some appealing images (mist as tendrils, tile warmth as talisman), but it suffers from notable repetition and abstraction. Phrases and even full ideas recur (“The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world,” “emergent hush,” “lilac unease”) without adding new layers, creating a sense of loop rather than progression. Figurative language often leans purple and vague rather than sharply concrete, which dampens momentum. Tighter line-level editing could cut redundancy and sharpen images substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it leans into repetition and abstract nouns (“devastation,” “purpose,” “compassion,” “despair”) at the expense of fresh, concrete turns. Several sentences paraphrase each other’s emotional content, especially around hope, rebirth, and aberrant mercy, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is modest rather than overloaded, but rhythm and structure remain monotonous. Tightening redundancy and sharpening image specificity would significantly elevate line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose has some lovely phrases and a clear aesthetic, but it leans into repetition and paraphrased ideas (“luring possibility from the brink of despair,” “fractured timeline,” “echoes,” “mystic orchard”) without new pressure or nuance. Many sentences restate the same emotional stance or effect, which dulls momentum and impact. Abstractions (“very fabric of reality,” “collective memories,” “essence of the mystic orchard”) pile up where sharper, more concrete images could carry the work. Line-level craft is competent but not yet cut to the density and precision an elite venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean, coherent, and largely free of grammatical issues, and most lines contribute to atmosphere or Luna’s process. That said, there is noticeable redundancy—similar phrases about somatic markers, inner pathways, and the geode’s influence recur without adding new pressure or nuance. Figurative language is light but sometimes leans on abstract phrasing instead of sharp images (e.g., “the hidden pathways of her creativity”). Line-level craft is functional and occasionally evocative, but it lacks the compression and surprise expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally evocative, but suffers from repetition and mild purple tendencies (“factually mystical,” frequent “seemed to” and “as if” constructions). Several sentences restate similar ideas about wonder, mystery, and determination without adding new information or pressure, creating a looped feel. The rhythm leans heavily on similar clause structures (“As she…,” “She felt…”) which dulls momentum. Line-level craft is solidly functional but not yet sharpened for maximum density and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sentences are mechanically sound, but the prose leans heavily on abstract nouns, similar structures, and paraphrase loops (“the truth began to unravel” / “as the truth further unraveled”). Many lines restate the same idea with slightly different metaphors (threads, skein, tapestry, narrative) without adding information or tension, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is mostly safe and coherent but overused relative to the small amount of concrete action. The final paragraphs in particular feel padded with conceptual repetition rather than sharpened, specific images.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally vivid (“branches etched like skeletal fingers”) but suffers from repetition (“sense that,” “she felt,” “the mist swirled,” “silver hush”) and paraphrased sentiments about peace, hope, and possibility. Many sentences restate emotional states without adding new image or pressure, softening momentum. Figurative language stays safe and unsurprising, never quite cutting into the specific strangeness of the situation. Overall, it reads smooth but padded and somewhat purple in places.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally smooth and readable with some strong sensory lines (“the soft lapping of the water,” “the faint tang of damp earth and decaying leaves”). Yet it tends toward repetitiveness and mild purple (“tiny, silken umbilical cord,” “spindrift serenity”) and occasionally restates similar ideas (fog lifting, stillness, serenity) without adding new pressure or information. Figurative language is frequent but not always doing double duty. Line-level craft is solid but not yet trim or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with clear sentences and few mechanical errors. However, there is notable repetition of concepts and structures (e.g., multiple near-identical statements about kindness, resistance to change, and resonance) that could be compressed. Figurative language is frequent but not always deepened; some images feel like gentle variations on the same mood rather than progressive intensification. The line-level craft supports atmosphere but does not yet achieve the density or precision expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some attractive images (the glowing tooth, the lone boat gliding in the hush). However, there is significant repetition of concepts and sentence patterns, especially around tranquility, purpose, and light versus darkness, which dilutes momentum. Many lines paraphrase or slightly vary earlier statements instead of adding new pressure or texture. The overall effect is pleasant but padded, not surgically precise.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean at the level of grammar and basic clarity, and individual sentences are serviceable. Yet there is significant paraphrase looping—many lines restate that Lyra is at peace, translating isolation into independence, working on the sundial, and listening to the hum—which slows momentum in such a short piece. Figurative language is light but occasionally awkward (“atomically reflective surface”) and doesn’t always earn its weight. Line-level tightening and reduction of near-duplicate sentences would substantially sharpen the piece’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with few grammatical or syntactic issues, and maintains a smooth, contemplative rhythm. There is some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“thread that connected all things,” “beauty and wonder that arose when individuals came together”) that could be tightened. Figurative and thematic language tends to repeat rather than deepen, edging toward mild purple but never collapsing clarity. Overall line craft is solid but not particularly sharp or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically sound but padded with paraphrase loops and near-duplicate sentiments (the radio station repeatedly as a “hub of activity,” her heart filled with “cautiously hopeful anticipation,” the charts’ “new significance”). Many sentences assert mood rather than embody it, and modifiers pile up (“ethereal grit,” “thick with tension,” “sense of possibility”) without adding new information. Rhythm is fairly monotonous, with similar sentence lengths and structures. This dulls momentum and makes the climax feel like more of the same rather than a sharpened beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with a steady forward flow. However, there is notable purple/abstract layering (“spatial mutiny,” “fallow period,” “vital key,” “underlying structure of the universe”) that often tells theme rather than sharpening image, and several phrases or concepts recur with little new information. Many sentences do only one job and rely on stacked modifiers rather than specific, concrete actions. The closure image is legible but dulled somewhat by prior repetition and generalized diction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean but prone to redundancy and abstraction, with repeated constructions (“As the artist…”, “As the mist…”) and frequent re-statements of the same emotional insight. Many phrases are stock (“a sense of clarity,” “a renewed commitment,” “a truth worth capturing”), which dilutes impact. The line-level rhythm is relatively flat and uniform, with little modulation to mirror emotional shifts. Figurative language (e.g., “lance the boil of her own emotional numbness”) tends toward the heavy-handed rather than the precise.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lines are mechanically sound and easy to parse, but the prose leans heavily on repetition and paraphrase (“as the night wore on,” “the spongey dread,” “nervously confident demeanor”) without adding new information or pressure. Many sentences perform similar work and could be compressed for momentum and density. Figurative language is sparse but, when present, leans generic (“fragile bubble,” “edge of a great unknown”). The overall effect is competent but padded, with limited multi-function sentences or rhythmic variation to heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans heavily on repetition and abstraction, with many sentences doing similar conceptual work. Phrases like “power of art to transform and redeem,” “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’,” and “luminous disbelief” recur or rhyme conceptually, creating a sense of loop rather than progression. Concrete, fresh images (the collodion flake, scaffold wrap) are outnumbered by generalized, near-cliché formulations. Rhythm and syntax are serviceable but rarely sharp or surprising, and the final paragraphs read like a summary epilogue rather than live scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it leans on repetitive phrasing and abstract nouns (“journey,” “paths,” “value,” “understanding”) that dilute impact. Phrases like “polished calm” and “dusky harmony” recur without gaining much new nuance, edging toward decorative repetition. Many sentences restate similar ideas about paths and stories, creating a sense of conceptual looping rather than progression. Line-level work is serviceable yet not particularly sharp or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Line-level craft is grammatically clean and readable, but leans heavily on repetition and abstraction (“sense of purpose,” “midnight solace,” “burdens,” “understanding”) rather than precise images. Several sentences paraphrase each other’s content with minor variation, which slows momentum and dilutes impact. Figurative language is sparse and safe; nothing egregiously purple, but also little that surprises. The final effect is smooth but somewhat bland and over-explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean but padded with repetition and near-duplicate sentiments, particularly in the latter half where “the journey was long,” “the druid was undaunted,” and similar lines restate the same idea. Many sentences perform only one task—restating resolve or wonder—rather than carrying layered information, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe, with little rhythmic variation or compression at key beats. The overall effect is serviceable but wordy and low in line-level distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft shows strong instinct for imagery and cadence, but leans into purple prose and repetition, reducing impact (“the possibilities were endless” reappears, abstractions stack in the finale). Many sentences do similar atmospheric work without adding new information, slightly bogging momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always selective; phrases like “intersection of dreams” and “after the future had arrived early” remain conceptual rather than grounded. The prose is competent and occasionally striking, yet could be significantly tightened for density and dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with some effective images and a consistent rhythmic feel. At the same time, there is notable redundancy (“trees, the roots, and the bones” recur almost unchanged; “glow of half-lit corridors” returns without new inflection), and a tendency toward purple, abstract phrasing (“patch holes in her soul,” “threads of her own making”) that could be tightened. Figurative language seldom muddies basic sense, but it often repeats function without adding new pressure or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it relies on repetition and paraphrase loops (“The silence was no longer…,” “The world was full of possibilities,” multiple near-identical resolve sentences). Many lines restate prior emotional content without adding new image or pressure, dragging momentum. Abstract nouns and stock constructions (“sense of trepidation and excitement,” “spark of a new beginning”) dilute specificity. This accumulative vagueness especially in the final third blunts the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is fluent but heavily looped: concepts like “reestablishing the connection,” “physics of transition,” “Magnetic arbor,” and “Knowledge fruit seed” are reiterated with minor variations instead of advancing meaning. Many sentences do only one job, often paraphrasing the previous line’s idea in different words, which saps momentum. Figurative language is sparse but safe; the main issue is redundancy rather than confusion. Line-level craft is serviceable but far from the concision and density expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and readable, but there is noticeable redundancy and scaffolding—multiple lines restate the same ideas about tidal identity, mechanical/organic harmony, and wonder in routine. Many sentences are long, similarly structured, and heavy with abstract nouns, which slows momentum. Figurative language is competent but safe, rarely surprising. Trimming repetition and sharpening concrete images would markedly strengthen the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, but the prose relies on repetition and abstraction: “latent radiance,” “resonant hush,” “hopes and fears,” and “hidden wonders” recur without adding precision. Many lines paraphrase the same idea (pearl as vessel of emotions, then key to human heart, then beacon of hope) instead of advancing tension. Figurative language stays coherent but leans toward purple and generic spiritual diction, which dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a smooth, readable cadence. However, there’s extensive repetition of structures and concepts (maps/journeys, stations as testaments, river whispers) that add little new information, creating a sense of looped paraphrase. Many lines tell emotional or thematic content in abstract terms rather than embodying it in action or sharply specific detail. Overall momentum is dulled by this redundancy, which would be unacceptable at a top-tier literary venue without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some pleasing images (the symbol “an unfolding cipher” is strong). Yet line-level craft suffers from repetition and abstraction: multiple sentences restate similar ideas about mist, whispers, anticipation, and being “forever changed” without adding new pressure or detail. Figurative language occasionally borders on purple and vague (“whispers of the library,” “fabric of reality being reshaped”) without concrete anchors. Information density could be tightened significantly to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some striking phrases and a consistent cadence. Yet it tends toward repetition (“as the midsummer sun dipped…,” “threads of fate,” “perforated destiny”) and abstract nouns that dilute impact. Figurative language occasionally verges on purple without adding new information, contributing to a slight momentum drag in such a short piece. Tightening redundancy and grounding a few key metaphors in concrete action would significantly elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level prose is clean and grammatical, with some strong images (e.g., the grotto as “a sentinel of the sky, watching over the world with a quiet, lucid awareness”). Yet there is clear paraphrase looping and concept repetition—aurora/threshold/beauty/mystery are reiterated with similar phrasing, often without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally purple, contributing to a slight sense of drag despite the short length. Momentum suffers in the final third as sentences restate Aria’s awe rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatical and readable, but it is heavily padded with paraphrase loops (“vineyard hush,” “cycle of rebirth,” “source of contentment” recur with similar framing) and high-level abstractions. Many sentences restate prior ones without new image or pressure, which erodes momentum and density. Figurative phrases like “vineyard hush” and “scallop the clouds” are intriguing but underdeveloped, leaning toward decorative rather than precise. Overall, the line-level craft is serviceable but not yet tight or incisive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but it frequently loops concepts (“nuance,” “gray areas,” “cloak of doubt”) with minimal new information, which softens momentum. Many sentences function as paraphrased scaffolding (“Their motivation became clear: to welcome nuance into certainty”) rather than vivid scene work. Figurative language is straightforward and not egregiously mixed, yet the reliance on abstract labeling over concrete dramatization makes the line-level feel flatly expository. Trimming repetition and embodying key beats would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to parse, but there is heavy paraphrase looping (e.g., multiple nearly identical statements about patterns, vanishing, delayed revelation, and the hush). Many lines restate prior sentences without adding pressure or new detail, flattening momentum. Figurative language is serviceable but often generic (“like a flower opening to the sun”) and overused at similar beats. Tighter pruning and more varied syntax would greatly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is clean and grammatically sound, and there are some evocative sentences early on. Yet the prose lapses into heavy repetition and paraphrase loops—especially with “as the dust continued to fall,” “remained steadfast,” “a reminder that”—without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language trends generic (“secrets of the universe,” “beauty and wonder that lay just beneath the surface of the world”) and the closing paragraphs explain rather than sharpen the imagery. Momentum and density suffer, keeping this below elite-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is competent and occasionally striking, but it overuses similar constructions and phrases (“lingering luminance,” “brilliant dimness,” “testament to the power”) that create a mild sense of redundancy. Many sentences reiterate the same idea—Eira’s search for inspiration or the spire’s beauty—without adding new pressure or detail. Figurative language is generally clear but trends toward the generic and slightly purple. Line-level craft supports atmosphere but doesn’t yet achieve the density or precision expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some pleasing images (lanterns as “a celestial map,” “meteor hush”). There is noticeable repetition in sentence structures and concepts (“palpable” appears twice in close proximity, and several lines restate his motivation or wonder without adding new information). Figurative language generally stays coherent, but abstractions like “the very fabric of reality seemed to be woven from the threads of sound and light” verge on purple without adding concrete stakes. Overall momentum is adequate for a lyric piece but could be tightened by cutting redundant or near-duplicate sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level writing is clean and grammatical, with some evocative phrases (“sweet, pungent aroma… mingling with the scent of old wood and the faint tang of starlight”). Yet the prose leans toward redundancy—many sentences restate that the decision maker feels excitement, doubt, fulfillment, or cosmic connection in similar terms. Figurative language is frequent but often generic (“secrets of the universe,” “part of something greater”), which blurs impact. Trimming repeated ideas and tightening modifiers would significantly improve momentum and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a smooth, readable cadence. Yet it suffers from redundancy and mild purple tendencies: phrases, concepts, and even exact constructions (“echo of sacrifice,” “as the…”) repeat without adding new pressure or nuance. Many sentences restate the same emotional state in slightly varied words, which dulls momentum in a short piece. Information density and rhythmic variety are adequate but not sharp or ruthlessly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with no major grammatical issues and a clear sequence of actions. Still, there is noticeable redundancy and abstraction (“brittle devotion,” “cosmic imbalance,” “fragile balance”) that recycle ideas without adding pressure or specificity. Several sentences restate the same emotional value (devotion, renewal, balance) in slightly different words, which blunts momentum. Line-level work is solid but not as tight or surprising as a top-tier venue demands.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to parse, with some strong images, but it leans into repetition and paraphrase loops (“trail of photographs,” “precisely humane touch,” “spin stories into shared meaning,” “mirrored hush”) without adding new information or pressure. Many sentences carry only one piece of information, and several lines restate the same emotional stakes in slightly different words. Figurative language is relatively restrained but not especially surprising, and the rhythm tends toward a steady, undifferentiated cadence that dulls momentum. Line-level craft is competent yet not tightened to the density and precision an elite market expects.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a smooth flow and no serious confusion about action or sequence. Still, there is noticeable repetition in concept and language around “wonder,” “magic,” and the orchard’s specialness, leading to a slight sense of paraphrase-looping and mild purple edging. Many lines do single-duty, telling us what Elara feels or believes instead of carrying layered implication through image. The final third retains clarity but could be leaner and more charged if some explanatory scaffolding were cut.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose is grammatical and clear, but it over-relies on similar sentence structures and a limited palette of abstractions (“burden,” “trust,” “secrets,” “patterns,” “essence”) that are recycled across paragraphs. Many lines restate prior information—Lyra working, the burden of watching, the trust of her peers—without adding new image or pressure, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is safe but familiar (stars as diamonds, velvet sky), so texture doesn’t quite justify the density. Trimming redundancy and sharpening a few concrete, surprising images would significantly elevate the line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly easy to follow, but it suffers from paraphrase loops and abstraction: many sentences restate the same ideas about numbness, identity, and determination with slightly different wording. Phrases like “it was this that he sought to vivify” and “it was this that drove him forward” recur as scaffolding rather than adding new information. Sensory specificity is thin outside of the initial hum and a few visual cues, which flattens the more supposedly intense beats (“the air around him began to vibrate with energy”). Line-level craft is functional but not yet sharpened or condensed for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and easy to parse, but it suffers from repetition and mild purple tendencies. Concepts like night-quiet, flowing brook, anticipation, and the seed’s mystery are reiterated without adding new facets, creating paraphrase loops and drag. Figurative phrases such as “storm-born silence” and “the hush of a possibility just born” sound striking but aren’t grounded in concrete action, which dulls their impact. Overall, the prose is competent but not sharp or economical enough for high-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically mostly clean but weighed down by redundancy and purple turns: phrases like “true haunting,” “etched in the hearts,” and “haunting melody” recur without adding new nuance. Several sentences paraphrase the same idea in near-synonymous language, especially in the back third, which blunts momentum. The hourglass sentence is actively clumsy and self-contradictory. Figurative density often exceeds what the scene can bear, making the line-level texture feel inflated rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often evocative, with some strong images (“a damp shroud,” mist as “ethereal tentacles”). Yet figurative language and abstract phrasing are heavily stacked, leading to a sense of purple density and some conceptual redundancy (multiple passes over mist, statues, and boundaries without new pressure). Terms like “dimensionally homesick” and “foggy lucidity” suggest depth but verge on pseudo-technical vagueness rather than sharpened insight. Rhythm and sentence variety are serviceable but not sharply tuned to escalate or release tension.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is fluent and mostly clear, with rhythmic cadences that support a ritualistic feel. Yet it’s notably overwritten: metaphors pile up, several sentences restate the same emotional beat (anticipation, destiny-breaking, twilight holding its breath), and abstract nouns outnumber concrete actions. Repetitions like “frozen bloom,” “penny drops,” and variants of anticipation feel like scaffolding rather than purposeful patterning. Information density is acceptable, but the figurative saturation and redundancy dampen momentum and undercut peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally evocative, but leans into repetition and purple abstraction (“hidden truth,” “shard of hush,” “veil of reality”) without adding new information. Many sentences perform the same function—asserting atmosphere or wonder—creating a sense of redundancy and softening momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always sharpened by concrete particularity, which blurs impact. Trimming paraphrase-loops and tightening diction around key beats would significantly increase density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some effective images (e.g., the hum “from the very fabric of reality”). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition of ideas and phrases—worlds “shifting and flowing like the sands in the hourglass,” excitement and trepidation named multiple times—without added nuance. Figurative language trends purple and abstract, diluting impact rather than sharpening it. Information density is moderate, but several sentences could be cut or tightened without loss of meaning or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically sound and occasionally striking, but it leans into repetition and abstraction that sap momentum. Many sentences reiterate the same concepts with minor variation (“the world around her seemed to erupt…,” “ever-shifting landscape,” “as memories began to alter,” repeated mentions of the thread and gallery waiting). Figurative language is often stacked without adding new information, edging toward purple and creating a sense of loop rather than progression. Line-level tightness and variety would need substantial revision for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from repetition of concepts and phrasing (city “once a place of darkness” becoming a “launchpad,” “unfolded horizons,” “benthing city…beacon of hope”) without added nuance. Many sentences restate the same idea of transformation and wonder, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Imagery leans on stock metaphors and adjectives rather than precise, surprising detail. Line-level craft is serviceable but padded and not tight enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    The writing is grammatically sound and occasionally lyrical, with a consistent tone, but it over-relies on abstract or reiterated phrasing (“mist,” “whispers,” “reminder,” “memories she helped keep alive”). Several sentences paraphrase the same emotional idea, creating mild redundancy and slowing momentum, especially in the closing third. Figurative language is safe rather than surprising, and key emotional beats are often told in summary, which blunts impact. Tightening and favoring more concrete, specific images over restatement would sharpen the piece considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and grammatical, with straightforward syntax and generally clear sequencing. There are some mild redundancies and stock phrases (“a sense of peace wash over her,” “left her changed”) that lower distinctiveness but do not obstruct clarity. Figurative language is sparse and usually coherent; the “crashing hush” motif is one of the few notable images. Overall the prose is functional and unobtrusive rather than striking, with room to cut summary and lean further into concrete, pressured moments.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it leans toward purple, with frequent abstractions and repeated constructions (“as the snow…,” “a sense of…”). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same emotional state or idea (mystery, solace, unlocking secrets) without adding pressure or new detail, which saps momentum. Metaphor and cosmic language often do only one job and feel generic rather than cutting. Despite that, the narrative remains readable, and the closure image is understandable, if somewhat overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and grammatically sound, with a strong sensory image palette and some effective sentences. Yet there is clear paraphrase-looping and near-synonymous repetition—especially around the birds’ patterns, the whispers, and the act of translation—that reduces momentum. Figurative density verges on purple without always adding new information, and several sentences could be cut with no loss of meaning. The line-level craft is solid but would benefit from tightening and more varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, but the prose leans toward repetitive, high-level summarizing (“Lena felt a sense of…,” “she knew that…”) and paraphrase loops. Figurative concepts are stacked without deepening (“gravitationally playful,” “cosmic joke,” “fabric of reality in tatters”), producing a mildly purple, pseudo-profound texture that slows momentum rather than sharpening it. Many lines restate internal state with near-identical phrasing instead of advancing scene or image. The closure beat, while legible, is dulled by this abstraction rather than crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Grammar and syntax are clean, and the prose is accessible, but there is substantial repetition of concepts and phrasing (beauty reawakened, mechanical grip, resonantly soft music) that could be tightened. Many sentences restate the same idea with minor variation, which flattens momentum and dilutes key images. Figurative language trends toward the generic and sentimental rather than precise and surprising. The closure paragraph repeats earlier sentiments instead of sharpening or reconfiguring them at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are clean and mostly well-structured, with no major grammatical slips. There is noticeable redundancy and abstraction—several lines restate his purpose and the stakes in similar language, especially near the end. Figurative language is sparse but safe; nothing is egregiously mixed, yet nothing is especially precise under pressure either. Overall momentum is adequate but could be tightened by cutting scaffolding and repeated thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is smooth and grammatical, with clear sequencing and no major confusions. However, it leans on repetitive structures and stock lyrical formulations, reusing phrases and concepts (“misting hush,” “whispers of forgotten dreams,” “hidden truth”) without adding new facets. Many sentences do only one job and feel like gentle paraphrases of each other, creating a mild sense of padding. Despite this, readability and basic momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to parse, with a smooth, meditative flow appropriate to the scene. Yet many lines repeat ideas with only slight variation (her role as guardian/caretaker, solitude, analog memories, the art–science blend), creating a sense of scaffolding and redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but safe, and rarely does more than one job at once, leading to mild purple tendencies without new insight. Tighter compression and more varied rhythms would increase momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and mostly clear, with a smooth cadence that suits a reflective piece. Nonetheless, there is substantial redundancy and synonym looping: phrases like “vitalize the essence,” “cipher of longing,” “runaway dream,” and “luminous absence” recur without adding new facets. The consistent abstraction and mild purple tilt blunt impact and slow momentum, because many lines restate the same idea in slightly different language. Trimming repetition and grounding key moments in fresher, more concrete images would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    The language is polished at the sentence level, but it leans heavily on repetition and purple abstractions (“cosmic possibility,” “improbable longing,” “enveloped secrets”) that dilute impact. Several adjacent sentences restate similar ideas—mysterious atmosphere, significance of the task, cosmic resonance—without adding new pressure or image. Figurative density is high while concrete, fresh specifics are relatively sparse, giving the prose a slightly over-scented quality. Still, grammar and sequencing are clean, and the closure image is clear even if thematically blunt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.9)
    Line-level prose shows vivid moments and a consistent mood, but it is weighed down by repetition and scaffolding (“she knew that…”, multiple nearly identical sentences about resolve and nostalgia). Several paragraphs rephrase the same internal state—determination mixed with unease—without adding new texture or information. Figurative language occasionally edges into purple or vague abstraction (“the very fabric of reality was beginning to unravel”) without concrete anchoring. Tightening redundancy and cutting explanatory lines would significantly increase momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and rhythmically varied enough to sustain the lyric mode, with several strong images (dust motes “danced in the faint light,” tea leaves as “tiny, twisted creatures”). However, there is evident redundancy—multiple sentences reiterate the hush, the task, or the archivist’s protectiveness without adding new pressure—and some metaphors verge on purple or generic (“very fabric of reality,” “topography of the soul”). Information density is decent but could be tightened for momentum, especially given the modest plot. The line-level craft is solid but not at the rigor or sharpness expected of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often musical, but it suffers from repetition and purple intensity: phrases like “color of wonder,” “essence of the land,” “radiant hush,” and “trail of wonder” recur without adding new facets. Many adjacent sentences restate similar ideas (hope, renewal, magic of nature) rather than advancing image or pressure, creating synonym loops. Figurative language is dense yet rarely surprising, relying on familiar abstractions (magic, wonder, essence) more than concrete, idiosyncratic detail. Momentum is consequently soft, as language decorates more than it drives.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with a few strong images (the needle glinting in prismatic starlight, the hush as a “living entity”). However, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases (“interlaced hush,” “silence she accumulated,” “tapestry needle glinted”) that adds a slightly looped, padded feel. Abstract nouns and similar sentence structures recur enough to dull momentum in a piece that already has minimal plot movement. Line-level craft is competent but not razor-sharp for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but it leans heavily on repetition (“secrets,” “whispers,” “hidden in plain sight”) and abstract summarizing rather than sharp, economical images. Several sentences paraphrase each other’s content without adding pressure or new detail, which dulls momentum. Mild purple phrases (“siren call,” “language that spoke directly to her soul”) feel unearned because they lack corresponding concrete anchors, keeping the line-level work at a competent but not publication-ready level.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft is clean and grammatically sound, with some effective images and a smooth read. However, there’s a tendency toward conceptual repetition and slightly purple abstractions (“the physics of letting go,” “forces that governed the act of surrender”) that flatten momentum. Several sentences restate similar emotional or thematic content without adding pressure or texture, giving a mild sense of essayistic looping. The prose is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet as lean, layered, or surprising as elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is fluent and mostly clear, with pleasing rhythm and no major grammatical issues. However, it leans toward purple repetition: multiple sentences restate the same states (“tinkersong wonder,” “underlying energy,” “otherworldly hum”) and many paragraphs echo the pattern “As she…” or “The [courtyard/storm/air]…” without adding much new pressure or image. Figurative language and abstractions are dense enough to slightly blur impact rather than sharpen it at climactic moments. Line-level craft is competent but could be tightened and differentiated to avoid redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with a smooth, lulling rhythm. However, it leans heavily on repetition (“soft, gentle,” “sense of,” “seemed to”) and paraphrases similar sentiments across many sentences, which dilutes momentum. Abstract phrasing and stock emotional language (“poignant beauty,” “enduring power of human connection”) reduce vividness. Tightening redundancy and grounding feelings in fresher, concrete images would significantly elevate line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentence-level clarity is solid and free of grammatical error, but there is substantial repetition and conceptual looping (the mentor, “spooled wholeness,” “empty spaces remembered,” Lyra’s calling) without added pressure or nuance. Figurative language tends toward cliché or vagueness (“twinkling like diamonds,” “sea of clouds,” “dusty starlight tone”) and many sentences restate similar ideas about wonder and unity. The pacing drags because reflection is rarely compressed; nearly every line aims for the same lyrical register. The prose is serviceable but overwritten for its amount of narrative movement.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is generally strong: sentences are clean, rhythmically varied, and descriptive without constant clutter. A few lines lean on abstraction or mild repetition (e.g., reiterated references to “faint indentations” and broad concepts like “limits of human understanding”), but they don’t significantly obscure sense or drag momentum. The prose sometimes tells thematic content where an image could suffice, which slightly flattens intensity. Overall, it’s publishable-quality prose with room to tighten and concretize in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with a smooth, readable flow. At the same time, it repeats structures and phrases (“As Eli…”, “the scratch of their pen… the only sound”) and leans on familiar adjectives and constructions, which slightly dulls momentum. Many sentences do only one job—stating sequential actions or emotions—rather than carrying layered information or tension. Overall, it’s competent line work but not yet compressed, surprising, or sharp enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with clear syntax and competent rhythm throughout. Imagery is often strong, but many phrases and concepts (e.g., “rhythm of repair,” “hauntingly bright,” “driftwood nostalgia,” “soft hush”) recur or cluster in ways that edge toward purple and repetitive. Several sentences restate similar emotional beats (tranquility, connection, beauty) without adding new pressure or detail, which slightly dulls momentum. Despite the ornamentation, causality and closure remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is competent and mostly clear, with a few pleasant phrases (“brambled hope,” “kaleidoscope of colorful creatures”). There is some redundancy and abstraction (“sense of purpose and belonging,” “thriving community,” “powerful catalyst for growth”) that pad sentences without adding new facets. Prose tends toward summary and generalities instead of concrete, multi-tasking images, which blunts momentum. Still, there are no major syntactic artifacts or confusing constructions, just a lack of compression and sharpness expected at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally smooth, and the rhythm of long, slow lines suits the contemplative scene. Yet there is noticeable redundancy around key phrases (“hush,” “fragile balance,” “beautifully flawed”) and some paraphrase looping that could be tightened without loss. Figurative language trends toward the generic and slightly purple in spots, prioritizing atmosphere over precision. The prose is solid but not yet lean or surprising enough for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are generally clear and correctly structured, with a smooth, middle-register cadence that keeps the story easy to read. There are minor slips (“an sudden”) and some clichéd or redundant formulations (“weight of her task,” “sense of pride and satisfaction,” “delicate veil of ice”), but no major loops or muddled metaphors. Line-level work is competent but not especially compressed or surprising; many sentences do only one job where they could carry more load.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and easy to follow, with few if any grammatical errors, and some pleasing phrases (“patterns of foam that danced on the surface”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of concepts and constructions—“as the pieces began to fall into place,” “messy and beautiful place,” repeated reminders of patterns and connections—creating a sense of paraphrase loops. Many sentences tell emotional states directly instead of layering concrete, surprising detail, which flattens momentum. Overall, the line-level craft is serviceable but padded and somewhat generic for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose offers some graceful sentences and pleasing images, but it leans into repetition and paraphrase (e.g., multiple sentences restating Ember’s sense of connection and purpose). Abstract phrasing and stacked modifiers (“gentle beauty,” “soft, ethereal music,” “serene and wondrous presence”) blur rather than sharpen impact. The line “mind mindfully scattered” signals copy-level slippage, and several sentences could be cut without loss of information or charge. Overall momentum is soft, and density could be tightened substantially for publication-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with some strong images (“sandstone walls still damp from the recent rain,” “the intricate dance of the tides”). However, there is noticeable repetition in both content and phrasing—multiple sentences reiterate that memories are rough, jagged, and must be smoothed; the fortress dampness and Elara’s precision recur without adding pressure. The tendency to explain what has already been shown (“Elara’s goal was…,” “She was a chef who could taste memories…”) introduces scaffold and slightly slows momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than risky, but it doesn’t actively muddle clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and readable, with some genuinely lovely phrases and a consistent cadence. At times it drifts into purple or redundant formulations (“testament to the power of harmony and connection” after many similar ideas), reducing density. Figurative language is frequent but not chaotic; it mostly preserves clarity even when it leans on stock uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is generally grammatical and readable, but it suffers from repetition (“as she worked,” “she knew that,” “the secrets that lay hidden”) and a tendency to restate the same idea in slightly different words. Many sentences are abstract or generalized, with limited concrete sensory detail or varied rhythm, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but often generic rather than surprising, and some phrases verge on purple without adding clarity. Overall, line-level craft is functional yet flabby, not yet at a polished literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with good rhythmic variation and a consistent descriptive register. Some lines carry multiple functions (world-building plus mood, e.g., the parchment crackling with age), but there is noticeable redundancy in concept and phrasing (“latent blaze,” “seeds of vigilance,” similar sentence structures about mist and tunnels). Figurative language is used sparingly enough to avoid purple prose, but several abstractions flatten impact where concrete detail could sharpen it. Momentum is serviceable yet a bit dulled by summary-like repetitions of her determination and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and generally well-controlled, with few syntactic errors or muddled images. Yet there is noticeable redundancy and restatement—similar ideas about empathy, silence, and harmonics appear in slightly varied phrasing across several lines. Many sentences do only one job, contributing to a faintly padded feel for such a short piece. Rhythm is pleasant but relatively uniform, with limited dynamic variation to track shifts in emotional or narrative intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and readable, but the prose is heavily redundant, with many lines reiterating hope, mystery, exile, and purpose in slightly varied language. Imagery tends toward abstract or stock formulations (“beacon of hope,” “power of the unknown”) rather than precise, surprising detail. Information density is low; several paragraphs could be cut without real loss of situation or emotional charge. The rhythm becomes monotonous because syntax and sentence moves are so frequently similar.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with a pleasant sensory density. That said, it frequently loops concepts—stillness, silence, frequencies, connection—without adding new information, which softens momentum. Figurative language occasionally drifts toward purple and generalized (“very fabric of reality was being woven anew,” “almost theatrical sincerity”) rather than concrete pressure. Sentence rhythms and structures are similar across the piece, creating a somewhat uniform, lulling cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence-level craft is clean and readable, with few grammatical or syntactic issues and a reasonably varied rhythm. Some phrases and concepts recur without adding new pressure (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “cultivating serenity within motion,” “essence of the forest”), creating mild abstraction and redundancy. Moments of purple or vague imagery (“turning of the tide’s thought”) blur rather than sharpen stakes. Overall propulsion is adequate, but greater concision and more concrete, character-grounded images would tighten the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean, flows smoothly, and avoids major purple excess or figurative muddle. There is some repetitiveness in structure and scaffolding (“she felt,” “she knew,” restating insights) and some summarizing at moments that could be dramatized. Information density is decent but not sharp; many sentences do only one job where they could do two. The final image is competent but could be more compressed and specific to land with greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is competent and clear, with solid sensory anchors and no serious grammatical errors, but it suffers from paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy (“singular convergence” / “converge in a singular convergence,” reiterated “complex interplay,” recurring “silence was oppressive”). Many sentences do single-duty, telling us what she feels or concludes rather than layering image, action, and implication. The rhythm remains fairly uniform, and some abstractions (“hazy precision of her thoughts”) feel like summary labels rather than dramatized states. While the closure image is legible, the line-level texture doesn’t quite achieve the compression and freshness expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, but it leans heavily into purple, with stacked modifiers and repeated abstractions that dilute force (“very essence of sound,” “deeper truths of existence,” etc.). Many sentences paraphrase the same idea—art reveals wonder—without adding new image or pressure, which slows momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always sharp or necessary, contributing to a mildly over-written feel. Line-level density serves atmosphere more than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with some strong images (“avalanchingly quiet,” “vortex of sound”) and a steady cadence. However, it leans into repetition and near-synonym loops—silence, hush, mysteries, secrets, realms, stillness—without adding new precision, creating a mild sense of purple redundancy. Several sentences restate similar ideas (her transformation, the flute’s power, the canyon’s quiet) rather than pushing momentum forward. Line-level craft is solid but would need tightening and more concrete, varied imagery to reach elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some strong images (the text as “a swirling vortex of meaning”). However, it frequently repeats abstractions and intensifiers (“otherworldly energy,” “turbulent landscape of human emotion”) without adding new specificity, creating a mild sense of purple redundancy. Much of the story summarizes process instead of staging moments, which flattens momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not razor-tight or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, with some effective images, but it leans into redundancy and mild purple flourishes. Several sentences rephrase the same idea—Eira’s purpose, the pendant’s effect, the world’s blur of reality and myth—without adding pressure or specificity. Heavy reliance on similar openings (“As she…,” “For in a world…”) and repeated conceptual language (“sense of wonder,” “magic that lay just beneath the surface”) dulls momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not yet tightened or varied enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sentences are generally clear and grammatically sound, with a consistent lyrical register. However, the prose often loops conceptually, restating similar ideas about truth, connection, and mist-clearing without adding new pressure or image. Abstract phrasing (“deep connections between the natural world and the human experience”) dilutes impact and slows momentum. Tighter, more concrete lines and less redundancy would markedly strengthen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally musical, but it over-relies on similar constructions and repeated phrases (“through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry,” “raveling silence,” “beacon of hope”), creating paraphrase loops. Many sentences carry stacked modifiers that add atmosphere but little new information, softening momentum. Figurative language is not actively confusing, yet the density of abstractions blurs specificity. Line-level work is solidly functional but not at a polished-literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and largely free of syntactic errors, with some effective images (the silk’s shifting patterns, the sword “like a phoenix from the ashes”). Yet it leans toward repetition and abstraction: similar sentiments about determination, transformation, and resilience recur without adding new pressure or detail. Phrases like “sweet scent of success” and “azure defiance” edge into purple, and multiple sentences paraphrase the same idea of transformation. Information density is decent, but tighter cutting and more concrete, varied imagery would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, with some effective sensory touches early on. However, there is substantial redundancy and scaffolding—many sentences reiterate her wonder, determination, or the shard’s constancy without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language like “kaleidoscope of images” and “reflection on rippling water” leans into stock phrasing, and the story often tells emotional states rather than embodying them. Rhythm tends toward syntactic sameness, especially through repeated subject openings and similar clause structures.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound with a smooth, readable rhythm. Yet it leans toward repetition and mild purple (“seemed to glow,” “luminescent ache,” “sense of safety”) without each recurrence adding new pressure or nuance. Many sentences do similar work in slightly different words, which softens momentum and dilutes key images. Tighter cuts and more varied, specific phrasing would be needed for elite-level line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Grammar and clarity are solid, and individual sentences are easy to parse. Yet there is substantial repetition at both sentence and paragraph levels (the lighthouse beam, her role, the cycle, the lantern as symbol), often without new information or pressure. Modifiers like “soft, ethereal light,” “warm, golden light,” and “otherworldly energy” rely on stock phrasing, diluting impact. Tighter cutting and more specific, less redundant imagery would markedly improve line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pretty, with some strong images (colors dancing across surfaces, pulsing wing). However, it leans into purple repetition and paraphrase loops—many sentences essentially restate serenity, wonder, or mystery in slightly varied terms, especially near the end. Figurative language clusters (“valley-mist wonder,” “sea of wonder,” “iridescent caution”) without adding new information or pressure, which dulls momentum. Tightening and cutting redundant lines would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose has moments of evocative phrasing (“stormlit tower,” “soft, lunar light”) and maintains a consistent mood. Yet it leans heavily on repetition and abstraction (“sense of wonder,” “magic of the mundane miracles,” “full of mysteries”), creating a faintly padded feel. Several sentences restate previous ones with slightly different wording, and key concepts are told multiple times instead of deepened. Line-level craft is competent but not sharp or surprising enough for immediate elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and readable, but there is considerable repetition of concepts and phrasing without added nuance, especially in the closing paragraphs. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea of rekindling, knitting, and hope, which slows momentum and blunts impact. Figurative language like “swaddle of sound” and “threads of woven dawns” is occasionally vivid but risks feeling formulaic when repeated without development. Overall, the prose is competent but could be sharply tightened and made more precise.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear and readable, with no major grammar or usage errors, and a steady, unhurried rhythm. However, there is noticeable repetition of ideas and phrasings (tranquility, paradox, wisdom, solace) without added nuance, and several lines drift toward soft abstraction or mild purple (“enlarged tranquility”). Information density is modest; many sentences re-state emotional states rather than advancing them. Line-level craft is solid but not especially economical, precise, or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a steady if somewhat flat rhythm. There is some redundancy and reliance on stock phrases (“sense of peace,” “beacon of hope,” “newfound appreciation”) that dilute impact. Most lines do at least one job, but relatively few do multiple jobs at once or surprise at the level of image or syntax. The prose supports clarity and mood but rarely achieves the density or sharpness expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is smooth and mostly clear, with a pleasant rhythm and occasional striking images, and there are no major grammatical or syntactic errors. However, it frequently loops concepts and phrases (“bygone era,” “luminous vows,” “quartz hush,” “frozen library”) without adding new pressure or information, which creates a sense of static reiteration. Figurative density is high and tends toward purple in places (“the silence was a quartz hush,” “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) without always earning that weight in scene terms. Information density and momentum are acceptable but not tight enough for elite short-form standards.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.7)
    The lines are mostly clear and readable, but there is noticeable redundancy and abstraction (“fragile peace,” “comforting unease,” “newfound understanding”) that pad without adding new information. Several paragraphs reiterate similar tensions (“truce of hush,” “fragile peace,” “tension between them was palpable”) instead of advancing plot or interior stakes. Sentence structures are largely similar in length and cadence, creating a mild monotony. The final paragraphs summarize the night’s significance rather than crystallizing it in a sharp, specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some attractive images and a steady rhythm. However, there is a good deal of redundancy and scaffold—repeated constructions of “she felt,” “a sense of,” and similar sentences restating wonder and motivation without adding new pressure or specificity. Adjectives and abstractions (“ethereal,” “spectral,” “otherworldly energy,” “mysterious”) pile up to create a slightly purple texture that blurs rather than sharpens impact. Information density is moderate, but clearer cutting and more concrete, less generalized phrasing would significantly heighten momentum and force.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, with some appealing images (charcoal-stained fingers, crystalline hum). However, there is noticeable redundancy and scaffolding, especially in the final third where multiple sentences restate the same insights about creativity, memory, and gratitude. Abstract modifiers (“auroral sorrow,” “otherworldly energy,” “mysterious forces”) recur without adding new information, tipping toward purple prose. Line-level tightening and more concrete, multi-tasking sentences would significantly increase momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and readable, with a number of pleasing images and efficient summary sentences. There is some repetition of scaffolding phrases and parallel clauses (“As she worked… As she walked… As she read…”) that could be tightened for rhythmic variety. Figurative language is controlled rather than purple, but the reliance on abstraction and summary in key beats dulls immediacy and momentum. Line-level craft is solid and publishable in many venues, but not yet at a rigorously honed, sentence-by-sentence level for a top-tier outlet.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically sound but heavily repetitive, with numerous near-duplicate sentences that restate the same concepts (art as beacon, symphonies of truth, post-verbal era) without adding pressure or nuance. Many lines do single duty and read as scaffolding or summary rather than charged image or action. Figurative language tends to New Age abstraction over concrete specificity, softening momentum and emotional impact. The lack of syntactic and imagistic variation in the latter half creates a sense of lyrical drift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but it leans heavily on repetition and conceptual language—phrases like “inner static,” “fragmented wholeness,” and “a testament to her dedication” recur without new nuance. Many sentences paraphrase the same emotional state rather than advancing image or action, which blunts momentum. Sensory detail is often gestural (“the air was thick with the scent,” “the flames were strangely organic”) instead of sharp and particular. The final paragraphs in particular summarize Aria’s peace in similar terms multiple times, dulling the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to follow, but heavily rely on repetitive scaffolding and summary (“The courtyard, once again, was filled…”, “The aged locket remained a poignant reminder…”). Many lines duplicate information or sentiment without adding new pressure, which dulls momentum. Figurative language is sparse and, when present (“sandstorm calm”), feels dropped-in rather than integrated. Overall, the prose is competent but padded and rarely multi-tasking.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentence-level clarity is solid and the prose is grammatically clean, but there is substantial repetition of structures and ideas—multiple sentences restate Aria’s determination, liberation, or calm defiance without adding new pressure. Figurative language (web, dice, encoding) is coherent yet hammered rather than deepened, sliding toward purple in places. Momentum suffers from paraphrase loops and similar sentence cadences, especially in the latter half. The line work is serviceable but not yet honed to the density and precision required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and fluent, with a few striking phrases and a coherent sonic texture; sentences are grammatical and easy to follow. That said, there is repetition of structures and phrases (“soft glow,” “sense of,” “mysterious forces,” “gleaming silence”) that could be cut or varied for tighter momentum. The descriptive density occasionally verges on static, as similar kinds of luminous imagery recur without adding new pressure or specificity. Overall, line-level craft is competent and sometimes lovely but not yet ruthlessly precise.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.0)
    Grammar and basic clarity are solid, and individual sentences are readable, but the prose suffers from redundancy and purple overgrowth. Phrases, images, and even entire concepts (tranquility, silence deepening, mapping silence, terrestrially cosmic energy) recur with minimal new information. The rhythm remains uniform, and many sentences perform the same atmospheric function without advancing character, situation, or theme. This lack of concision and variation dulls momentum and prevents the final image from landing with the sharpness it could have.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is clear and mostly economical, but it leans heavily on generic formulations (“eyes sparkled with curiosity,” “sense of wonder,” “subtle magic”) and repetition of similar sentiments. Several sentences paraphrase or reiterate the same idea (e.g., the student will “never see the world in the same way again” followed by the tutor’s “sense of wonder” about mysteries). Figurative language is light and safe rather than vivid or surprising. Line-level craft is competent but not yet at the precision or density expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is technically sound but leans into repetition and abstraction: words and phrases like “whispers,” “journey,” “memory,” “resolve,” and “velvet garden” recur without adding new facets. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (“The seashell’s song was a key…,” “The seashell half had been the catalyst…”) creating a looped feel and softening momentum. Figurative language tends toward generic lyricism (“ethereal ballerinas,” “tragically radiant beauty”) rather than precise, surprising images. Information density is modest and many lines tell emotional states instead of advancing scene, which keeps this below a publishable standard for top venues.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is competent and grammatically clean, with some attractive images (e.g., the aurora’s light on marble, the scent of parchment and rose). Yet it leans heavily on repetition and near-duplicates (“both faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct” appears in near-identical form twice, and many sentences restate the same idea of transformation and closure). Figurative density occasionally tips toward purple without adding new information, which slows momentum in such a short piece. Line-level tightening and pruning of redundancies would significantly sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and frequently musical, but it leans toward purple: stacked abstractions (“the hum of the universe,” “secret song”) recur without new specificity. There are clear paraphrase loops and near‑duplicates (“reed‑blown melancholy” appears twice; multiple sentences recap that she sings and discovers webs of intrigue) that could be cut without loss. Figurative language is heavy and often generic, weakening impact and momentum. Line‑level craft is solidly functional but not rigorously distilled.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and generally clear, and the rhythm is readable, but there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases (“windows of connection,” “wreckage,” “borrowed starlight,” “soft, ethereal light”). Figurative language leans toward the purple and often restates similar moods without adding new facets, which slightly dulls momentum. The line-level work is competent but not especially economical or surprising. Tightening loops and sharpening a few metaphors would significantly elevate the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clean at the sentence level, with few grammatical issues and a smooth, readable cadence. However, there is notable repetition of concepts and stems (“hidden patterns,” “she felt,” “she had”), and several near-duplicate sentiments that could be cut without loss. Some phrases lean purple or abstract, blurring specificity and diluting momentum. Line-level craft is solid but padded, not yet lean or sharp enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Line-level craft is clean and readable, with no major grammatical issues, but there is substantial repetition and scaffolding (“she was driven,” “she pushed on, undeterred,” “she was ready”), and many sentences perform only one simple job. The prose leans heavily on abstract nouns and stock phrasing (“sense of wonder and awe,” “sharp mind and a sharper tongue” without demonstration), which dulls momentum and vividness. Descriptive beats often restate information rather than adding pressure or specificity. Competent but mechanically patterned and under-compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.9)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean but heavily reliant on abstraction and repetition, often restating the same idea with minor wording changes (“shape a new dawn,” “brighter tomorrow,” “new era”). Figurative language is sparse and mostly in stock pairings (“moths to a flame,” “spreading like wildfire”), which dulls freshness. Long paragraphs of summary with similar rhythms sap momentum and keep information density low. The final third continues the same expository cadence, so the closure image lacks sharpened specificity or rhythmic lift.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The lines are grammatically clean and readable, with a smooth sentence-level rhythm that suits contemplative prose. However, there is notable redundancy and scaffolding—multiple sentences restate similar ideas about regret, purpose, and isolation with slight variation, and modifiers like “positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor,” and “feral beauty” create a purple, slightly clichéd patina. Figurative language is frequent but not always fresh, and the abstractions sometimes do only one job instead of advancing both image and character. The cumulative effect is pleasant but wordy and occasionally dulled by repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking (the opening line and the idea of “silence that was, in fact, a rich tapestry of sound” work well). However, there is notable repetition of concepts and phrasing—“ethereal,” “vibrate,” “resonance,” “deep sense”—without added nuance, bordering on paraphrase loops. Figurative language tends to stack similar textures rather than diversify or surprise, creating a slightly purple, homogeneous feel. Momentum suffers somewhat as multiple sentences and paragraphs reiterate her mission and sensations rather than advancing or sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sentences are clear and mostly well-constructed, but there is heavy paraphrase looping: similar sentiments about significance, anticipation, and revolution recur with minimal new information. Many lines tell internal states in near-identical language rather than layering or sharpening them. Imagery around the moon, ice, and viaduct is occasionally striking but not tightly edited, so momentum sags. Line-level craft is solid yet padded, lacking the compression and precision expected at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally lucid, but it leans heavily on repetition and near-duplicates (“The sound of the dripping water continued to reverberate…” appears in slightly varied forms) that add bulk without new insight. Many sentences convey the same idea—Maya is calm, reflective, freeing herself—using different abstractions, which slows momentum. Figurative language is sparse but safe; the price is a lack of vivid, concrete moments that do more than one job. Tighter cuts and more specific, image-driven lines would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is competent and largely clear but often wordy and repetitive, with phrases and concepts (“vibrant hush,” “turn their apologies into action,” “second chances”) echoed rather than developed. Figurative language leans purple and abstract, sometimes stacking metaphors without adding precision or pressure. Several sentences could be tightened without loss, and the rhythm stays fairly uniform, contributing to a gentle monotony that matches tone but dampens momentum. Line-level craft is solidly functional, not yet at the concision and multi-function density of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but there is heavy reliance on paraphrase and near-duplicate sentences that reassert the same ideas (Zephyr’s curiosity, the workshop’s evolution, the algorithm’s mystery). Many lines perform only one job—restating motivation or theme—rather than advancing image, character, and stakes simultaneously. The accumulation becomes monotonous, dulling momentum and the impact of the final ringing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose is competent and readable, but it leans heavily on repetitive constructions and paraphrase loops (“Lena’s journey had taken her… she had emerged transformed… The sensed absence… The recurring numbers…”), especially in the final third. Many sentences restate similar ideas about absence, mystery, and transformation without adding new information or pressure, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is sparse but generally safe; the main issue is redundancy and a summarizing mode rather than scene-based immediacy. Line-level craft would need tightening and more specificity for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    Line-level craft is generally clean and grammatical, with some evocative images (“branches etched against the pale sky like a delicate pen and ink drawing”). However, the prose often circles the same ideas with similar constructions, creating mild redundancy and a sense of padded lyricism. Abstract phrases (“shifting landscapes of the heart,” “courageous anomaly”) dilute immediacy and information density. The momentum is slow but coherent; no sentence obscures meaning, yet few carry multiple layers of work.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it is weighed down by redundancy and abstraction (multiple near-identical sentences about finding peace, purpose, or solace). Figurative language is mostly straightforward and coherent, though not especially fresh. Many lines restate prior emotional information without adding specificity or pressure, which dulls momentum in what is already a low-action piece. Tighter, more concrete phrasing and a cutback on scaffolding (“I felt,” “I began to notice,” “a sense of”) would significantly sharpen the work.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose has some pleasing images and smooth syntax, but it is heavily repetitive in both phrasing and concepts (“secrets and stories,” “destined mismatches,” “passionate subtlety,” “gently persuasive,” “deep and profound” recur with minimal new information). Many sentences essentially paraphrase previous ones, diluting momentum and density. Figurative language tends to be safe and generalized rather than surprising or precise. Line-level craft is serviceable, but the ornament and redundancy would need tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but heavily padded by repetition and near-duplicate sentiments (“they felt a sense of peace… a sense of having done something truly meaningful,” followed later by similar assertions). Abstract nouns and modifiers (“essence of wisdom,” “sanctuary of whisperfield calm,” “inner world”) recur without new angles, creating a sense of looped scaffolding. Sentence rhythm often clusters in similarly structured clauses beginning with “The line walker…” or “As they…,” which dulls momentum. Figurative language is not overblown, but the lack of compression and pruning keeps information density and propulsion modest.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally evocative, but it leans into repetition and scaffolding (“Luna felt a sense of peace settle over her” appears essentially twice; multiple sentences restate serenity and purpose). Many paragraphs reiterate the same ideas—peace, tranquility, collective healing—without adding new information or pressure, which flattens momentum. Figurative language is safe rather than overblown, but the overall texture trends toward redundant rather than densely efficient. Trimming repeated sentiments and varying syntax would sharpen the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and readable, with good sensory density and few outright redundancies. Some motifs and descriptors repeat (“sonically reflective,” “pattern of growth,” hush/silence) in ways that occasionally feel more like emphasis than development, flirting with mild overwriting. Sentences tend toward a similar contemplative cadence but avoid outright monotony. There are no serious clarity issues or figurative muddles, and the final image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasing, with some effective images (“the hush of old videotapes left unwatched,” “tendrils curling around the sculptures like ethereal fingers”). Yet the piece leans heavily on repeated formulations and abstract nouns, causing mild redundancy and a sense of circling rather than advancing. Many sentences do similar work emotionally and conceptually, diluting impact; trimming could sharpen momentum and image density. There are no major figurative misfires, but the cumulative effect veers toward gentle overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level craft is grammatically clean but weighed down by repetition and scaffolding: many sentences restate the same emotional or thematic content with minor variations. Abstract nouns (“turmoil,” “mysteries of the universe,” “beauty and wonder”) often replace precise sensory detail or concrete action, which saps momentum. Pivotal beats—like reinforcing the observatory—are summarized in broad strokes rather than rendered through vivid, specific images. The prose achieves a consistent mood but lacks density, propulsion, and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but it leans on repetition and familiar formulations (“the power of music to transcend,” “soothing harmony,” “soft, gentle tune,” “flawless goodbye”). Many sentences restate similar ideas of peace, hope, and gentleness without adding new texture, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is safe and sometimes purple, but rarely surprising or incisive. Overall, it’s competent line work that could be tightened and made more specific to avoid blur.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, and paragraphing is sensible. However, there is noticeable redundancy: concepts like the key’s importance, Lyra’s deliberateness, and her path “to understanding” are reiterated without adding pressure or new nuance. Figurative language is sparse but also fairly stock (“stars twinkled like diamonds”), and many sentences do only one job, leaving information density modest. The line-level work is competent but not yet sharpened or economical enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.4)
    Line-level writing is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but it leans heavily on redundancy and vague formulations (“sense of wonder,” “spark of curiosity,” “sense of purpose begin to take shape”). Many sentences rephrase the same emotional state with slight lexical variation, diluting momentum and density. Figurative moves like “turn mistakes into constellations” and the tooth “yearning for the stars” are potentially vivid but overemphasized, turning them into slogans rather than discoveries. Overall, the prose feels serviceable but padded and somewhat purple in places.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally graceful, but it is heavily overwritten, with frequent near-duplicate phrases and a narrow palette of descriptors. Many sentences restate the same ideas (“sense of peace,” “sense of purpose,” “pearl of stillness,” “gentle luminescence”) without adding new information or pressure. Figurative language is safe and predictable rather than sharp or surprising. This density of repetition slows momentum and blunts the impact of otherwise solid images.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with some appealing images (servers overgrown with moss, the thawing-icicle pattern). However, there is noticeable redundancy and abstraction—multiple sentences restate that Aria is healing, vulnerable yet strong, or finding a new beginning. Late paragraphs slide into sentimental, high-level phrasing that dulls momentum and reduces information density. Figurative language is light enough not to confuse, but it rarely surprises or deepens beyond the obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean, but it’s highly repetitive and abstract, with many near-duplicate constructions (“she felt a sense of…”, “she knew that she had to…”) and restated insights. Figurative language (“swirling hush,” “inside the whisper of closing pages”) is consistent in palette but often stacked without adding new information, edging toward purple in places. Sentences tend to similar length and structure, blunting momentum and making the middle and end feel like paraphrases of the opening situation. There is limited concrete, sensory specificity beyond mist, shell, and white gown, so the language rarely sharpens into vivid, memorable images.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pretty, with some effective sensory phrasing (“haunting, lilting tune,” “gathering hush”). That said, there is notable repetition of concepts and phrases (connection, essence, sacred practices, sense of longing/connection) without added nuance, and many sentences share similar length and cadence. Figurative language leans toward the generic and is sometimes stacked, nudging into mild purple prose without deepening meaning. Line-level craft is solid but would benefit from tightening and more varied, specific turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is smooth and generally well crafted, with clear sentences and a strong sensory palette that supports mood. There is some repetition of ideas and phrases (e.g., variations on stillness, the world holding its breath, slow movements) that doesn’t always add new information or pressure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; it occasionally slips into slightly purple, abstract territory that dilutes impact rather than sharpening it. Line-level control is solid but not as ruthlessly precise or compressed as top-tier literary markets demand.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasing, with a few strong phrases (“store this wonder in the cellar of reason”) and a smooth, readable cadence. At the same time, there is noticeable redundancy in both meaning and structure—several sentences reiterate Elian’s curiosity, the season’s wound, or the cavern’s secrets without new pressure. Figurative language is safe and occasionally cliché, and the long, similar sentences create a slightly monotonous rhythm. Overall, it’s serviceable and at moments graceful, but not yet line-tight or maximally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally grammatical and clear, with vivid phrases and a stable aesthetic. However, there is notable redundancy: multiple sentences reiterate that the weaver’s work will linger, that the grotto returns to normal, that people will remember, etc., without adding new pressure or image. Figurative language occasionally trends purple and abstract (“boundary-lessly trapped,” “calcify the ephemeral nature of these burdens”) without concrete embodiment. The overall effect is pleasant but slightly verbose and low on propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with some pleasing sensory lines (rain on the skylight, the scrape of tools, scent of tea and wood). At the same time, it leans heavily on repetitive structures and conceptual phrases (“she felt a sense of…,” “a sense of peace settle over her”), which dilutes momentum and specificity. Figurative language like “rust-hued peace” and “crystallized time” is evocative but borders on purple when not grounded in concrete action. Line by line, the piece is competent but could be tighter and less abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are grammatically clean and easy to parse, and the rhythm is serviceable for a quiet, lyric piece. That said, there is substantial paraphrase looping—multiple lines reiterate the same ideas about regret, fragments of stories, and human connection with slightly different wording. Abstraction (“relentless passage of time,” “eroded ambitions”) outpaces concrete sensory detail, which flattens momentum and makes sections feel padded. The closing paragraphs, in particular, summarize and restate rather than delivering new specific images or pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatical and readable, with some effective images (“last wisps of carnival smoke dissipated into the dusty air”), but it leans heavily on repetition and summary. Many sentences restate the same idea about hope, possibility, or abandonment with slightly different wording, which dulls momentum. Figurative and thematic language clusters in similar formulations, edging toward sentimentality and reducing information density. Line-level craft is serviceable but not yet sharp or economical enough for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but repetition and adornment drag momentum (“glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia,” and “excruciatingly gentle” recur without new angles). Several sentences paraphrase similar emotional states in slightly different words, creating synonym loops and a mild sense of padding. Figurative language clusters without always earning its weight, tipping into purple in places. Tighter, more selective phrasing would sharpen impact significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatical, with some pleasing images (“silence of the morning radio…hung in the air like a promise”). At the same time, it relies on repetitive abstract phrases and near-synonymous restatements that don’t add new pressure or detail, creating a mild sense of loop and purple haze. Many sentences state internal states or concepts rather than advancing through concrete action. Momentum is adequate but not sharp, and figurative language sometimes feels generic rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with some pleasant sensory lines, but it leans heavily on repetition and paraphrase (e.g., multiple passes over her connection to the ocean, the fog, and her patience). Many sentences do single, redundant jobs, which slows momentum in a story that already has low plot pressure. Several phrases are clichéd or abstract, blunting the otherwise solid atmospheric work. Tightening and sharpening line-level choices would markedly improve density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clear and readable, with some strong images, but it is overstuffed: long sentences, stacked modifiers, and repeated concepts create drag. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase one another, especially around mood (“silence,” “stillness,” “melancholy,” “lonesome splendor”), reducing information density. Figurative language often feels generic or unearned rather than precise. Line-level tightening and greater selectivity would be required for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clear and mostly grammatical, with some pleasing images and a consistent rhythm. That said, it leans toward purple and repetitive structures (“As he…,” “The prince…”) and occasionally restates the same emotional state in different words. Abstract nouns and intensifiers (“quaking reverie,” “sense of anticipation and trepidation”) sometimes blur rather than sharpen. Line-level craft is serviceable but would need tightening and more concrete, varied phrasing for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and mostly grammatical, with some attractive images (“obsidian lagoon,” “sweet scent of wet earth and new life”). There is noticeable repetition of sentence structures and phrases (“as the night wore on,” “felt a sense of,” restatements of peace/connection), and some purple or abstract language (“unyielding compassion,” “true calling”) that flattens impact. Still, line-level clarity is maintained and no major artifacts obscure meaning. Tighter, more varied syntax and more concrete phrasing in key beats would significantly elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and largely free of grammatical or structural issues; sentences are clear, and the sequence of events is easy to follow. Some lines are evocative, but there’s noticeable redundancy (“her mission was,” “she was on a mission,” multiple near-synonymous descriptions of quiet determination). Abstractions (“essence of the city's lost history,” “trapped memories”) often substitute for concrete, specific imagery, which dulls impact. Overall it’s competent and smooth but not especially sharp or dense.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and readable, but leans heavily on repeated phrases, near-duplicate sentences, and abstract modifiers (“infinite,” “eternal,” “delicate beauty”). Figurative language is safe rather than surprising, and density of similar constructions creates a lulling monotony. Many lines restate the same ideas about beauty, patterns, and gentle light without adding pressure or detail. The final effect is polished but padded rather than tightly honed.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose contains some lovely images (e.g., “soft, lunar glow”; “thundering calm”) and is grammatically clean, but it leans on repetition and scaffolding. Many sentences restate emotional states (“felt a sense of peace settle over her”) with similar phrasing, and there is frequent use of “The carver…” / “As she…” stems that flatten rhythm. Abstract formulations (“shape of collective grief,” “intricate web of life and death”) recur without new specificity, creating a mild sense of looped language. Overall, the momentum is more float than drive, and trimming redundancies would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but it suffers from paraphrase loops and heavy repetition of key phrases and images (pendulum bob, tidal obsidian ridge, incremental absolution, balance, darkness/light). Many sentences restate the same emotional state or thematic point without adding new nuance, which blunts momentum. Figurative language tends toward the generic rather than the precise, and the lyric ambition sometimes tips into purple abstraction. Tightening and sharpening would significantly increase impact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pretty, with some evocative phrases (“velveteen gloom,” “shape of intentions”). Yet there is noticeable repetition in structure and content (threads untangled; understanding deepens; echoes and intentions reiterated) without added pressure or nuance. Figurative language sometimes verges on purple and vague rather than sharpening concrete experience. Line-level craft is competent but not especially tight or propulsive for this length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some pleasing images (the spire “like a shard of darkness,” the lake as “a blank page”). There is noticeable redundancy (“the pen hovered, poised…” appears conceptually twice; “frozen lake” and “obsidian spire” are reiterated without new inflection) and a reliance on abstract nouns (“possibility,” “potentiality,” “transformation”). Figurative density edges toward purple but doesn’t fully swamp clarity. Overall, line-level craft is competent but could be tightened and made more concrete to sustain elite-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The line-level writing is largely clean and readable, with some strong sensory combinations (radio glow on dust motes, mist outside vs. ember alcove inside). Yet there is noticeable repetition of structures (“as she…”) and motifs (mist, glow, alcove) without new inflection, and several sentences paraphrase previous ones in slightly different words. Figurative language occasionally tends toward purple and redundant rather than sharpening meaning. The prose carries atmosphere effectively but could be tightened for higher information density and dynamic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically solid but weighed down by redundancy, stock phrases, and paraphrased ideas (“sense of longing,” “essence,” “transience of art and life”) that recur without adding nuance. Many sentences perform single, abstract functions instead of carrying layered information, slowing momentum in such a short piece. There is occasional awkward construction (“that seems to weaves truth carefully”) and a tendency toward summary over concrete, embodied moments. Overall, it’s clean but not sharp or economical enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a few strong images (“detritus of a civilization long lost,” “vast, waterlogged tomb of steel and stone”). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and modifiers (“strange, twisted sense of purpose,” “strange, perverse kind of peace,” multiple mentions of “competing narratives” and “rationally rebellious”), which dilutes impact. The line-level density sometimes drifts into redundancy rather than layering meaning. Overall readable and serviceable, but in need of tightening for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasant, with some strong images (stained glass “kaleidoscope,” the rosette “dancing” in fading light). Yet there is noticeable repetition of concepts (“harmony,” “vanishing arts,” “sense of peace/traveled stillness”) and a tendency to explain what images already imply, leading to mild redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but not always doing new work; several sentences paraphrase the same idea with slightly different abstractions. This softens momentum and keeps information density from reaching elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean and grammatical, with smooth sentences and a steady rhythm. There is some redundancy and mild purple-prose drift (e.g., “with a gentle reverence, pruning… with a precision that bordered on reverence”), and many lines summarize emotion or theme rather than advancing scene. Figurative and abstract language appears often enough to slow momentum, but not so much that clarity breaks. Overall, the line-level work is competent and readable but could benefit from tightening and more concrete, multi-tasking sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent and generally smooth, with a few pleasing phrases and no major grammatical issues. There is some redundancy and mild purple-leaning language (“warm nectar dusk glow,” repeated reminders of wonder and resilience) that doesn’t always earn its weight. Sentences tend toward similar cadences, but not to the point of real drag. Line-level craft is solidly publishable for many markets but well below the precision and compression expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, grammatical, and easy to follow, with a smooth rhythm appropriate to the quiet mood. Some lines are evocative, but there’s a tendency toward repetitive abstract phrasing (“she began to ponder the concept of…”, “she wondered if it was possible”) that slightly dilutes impact. Description occasionally edges toward purple without adding new information, yet it doesn’t seriously obscure clarity or closure. Tighter, more specific line choices would raise the piece to a more competitive level.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally offers pleasing images (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”). That said, there is substantial repetition of concepts (“cascading revelations,” “nuance and understanding,” “vibrant, thriving ecosystem”) and many sentences simply rephrase prior ones. Line-level work tends toward telling and abstraction instead of concrete scene, which dulls momentum. Figurative language rarely does more than restate theme, giving a slightly padded, looped feel.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans heavily on repetition and paraphrase loops (multiple sentences beginning “As I climbed…” with similar content). Abstract nouns and familiar formulations (“secrets of the universe,” “rabbit hole of speculation”) weaken specificity and momentum. Figurative language is serviceable but rarely surprising, and the density of similar images (stairs stretching on forever, endless labyrinth) creates a sense of redundancy. Line-level tightening and more concrete, varied imagery would significantly sharpen the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, and the rhythm is generally smooth. Yet there is notable repetition (“saffron quiet of the night” returns verbatim; the smog receding and the sanctuary motif are reiterated), and figurative density sometimes becomes decorative rather than precise. Many sentences restate similar ideas about hope, noise, pollution, and kindness without adding new pressure or detail. The overall effect is mildly overwrought, with some momentum loss from redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and mostly clear, with some nice images (“rosewater dread,” “last wisps of mist”) and smooth sentence flow. Yet it leans on stock formulations and paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated “weight of the city’s stories / weight of their discovery,” multiple “as they…” transitions). Many sentences function as exposition or summary rather than doing double duty with image and action. Overall it’s serviceable and readable, but not yet at the density and precision expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sentences are grammatically sound and mostly clear, with some effective atmospheric lines (“under the slow exhale of low tide”). There is noticeable redundancy in phrasing and concept—variations of “hidden secrets,” “mystery,” “latent radiance,” and “his heart pounded with excitement” recur without adding new pressure. Prose tends toward summary and abstract nouns rather than dense, multi-functional lines that advance character and situation simultaneously. Overall momentum is adequate but dulled by repetition and lack of sharp, specific images at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear and grammatically sound, but it leans heavily on repetition and familiar horror clichés (“black as coal,” “cold, dead weight,” “siren’s call”). Several lines paraphrase the same idea—especially around lingering luminance, the funhouse’s call, and the advisor’s whisper—without adding new pressure or image. Adjectival stacking and abstract nouns (“decay and forgotten dreams,” “repulsive allure”) sometimes substitute for fresh, concrete detail. Line-level craft is competent but lacks compression, variety, and surprise expected at a prestigious literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pretty, with some strong images (“tiny, shining jewel suspended in the vast expanse of the open seas”). Yet there is noticeable redundancy in both imagery and sentence content—multiple near-identical statements about the orchard as jewel, the music fading, stars twinkling, etc. Adjectival and adverbial stacking veers toward purple, and many lines restate mood rather than add new information or pressure. This density without escalation slows momentum and dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentences are generally clean and grammatical, and the narrative flows without major confusion or syntactic tangles. However, there is noticeable redundancy—similar structures and phrases recur (“Lyra felt…,” “She knew that she had to…,” repeated mentions of sun, watchers, dread) without always adding new information or pressure. Much of the emotional content is told rather than shown, which flattens intensity at key beats. Line-level craft is solid but not especially compressed or multi-functional, leaving room to tighten and sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally vivid (“skeletal fingers,” “dust motes dancing in the air”), with clear sequencing. Yet it frequently lapses into cliché or stock metaphor (“tangled web of history,” “pit of lies,” “small but significant victory”) and paraphrase-like repetition of ideas about noble lies and truth. Many sentences serve only to restate stakes or theme rather than advance scene, blunting momentum. Line-level craft is competent but not sharp enough for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pleasant, but there are many paraphrase loops and stock formulations (“a testament to…,” “a reminder that…,” “a guiding light…”) that dilute impact. Phrases and concepts repeat with minimal new pressure—e.g., the inkwell’s symbolic function is described multiple times in nearly identical terms. Figurative language is mostly safe but leans purple in places (“a hushed blaze,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) without being fully earned by scene pressure. Overall momentum is slowed by abstraction and redundancy rather than sharpened by line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically sound and occasionally vivid, but it leans heavily on repetition and synonymous restatements of Elara’s resolve, satisfaction, and connection to the place. Phrases like “reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve,” and multiple “sense of [emotion]” constructions recur without adding new layers, creating paraphrase loops and a mildly purple undertone. Information density is moderate, yet many lines do similar emotional work rather than advancing tension or image. The final third continues this pattern, softening the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatical and often pretty, with some striking images, and it maintains a consistent rhythm suited to a meditative vignette. Yet there is notable repetition and purple-leaning density (“shaping, molding, transforming,” “luminous torment,” recurring near-synonymous formulations of grief and solace) that reduce information density and momentum. Many sentences do the same job of restating Kaito’s sorrow or the garden’s tranquility without new pressure. Line-level craft is solid but would need tightening and pruning to meet elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, but there is noticeable scaffolding and redundancy (e.g., “The unfiltered awakening had been a brutal awakening”) and repeated formulations around the crystal’s “essence” and her “awakening.” Figurative language leans toward vague or strained (“intangibly tangible essence,” “bleak exhilaration”) without adding precision or new insight. Many sentences perform a single, summary function instead of layering action, image, and emotion, which dulls momentum. Overall, the line-level work is competent but not yet compressed or sharp enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clear and readable, with some attractive images and a steady rhythm, and there are no major grammatical issues. However, it overuses similar atmospheric descriptors and stock similes (“like diamonds,” “velvet expanse”), leading to a sense of sameness. Several sentences paraphrase or reiterate existing information (e.g., multiple statements of anticipation/belonging) rather than adding new pressure or texture. Figurative language is safe rather than sharp, keeping line-level craft competent but not publication-grade at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, with some striking images (driftwood as skeletal fingers, the watch hand glinting in lunar glow). At the same time, there is noticeable repetition and paraphrase (“she was driven by a need to know,” “weight of her guilt,” similar sentences about secrets and truth), and a tendency toward purple, atmospheric description without new information. Some lines simply restate prior sentiments in slightly different words, slowing momentum. Figurative language mostly holds, but it isn’t always doing multi-layered work scene by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and largely clear, with some striking phrases and a consistent rhythm. However, there is significant redundancy (“mist swirling around her” and “uncommonly thoughtful expression” recur; the balance/delicate task is reiterated), and many sentences paraphrase the same conceptual ground. Abstract language (“weight of that responsibility,” “path to healing and reparation”) often substitutes for concrete dramatization. The accumulation drifts toward purple and slows momentum, preventing a sharper, more economical line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically sound but weighed down by redundancy and paraphrase loops—phrases like “align his heart and actions,” “sense of purpose,” and “backlash of regrets” recur with minimal new nuance. Many sentences carry only a single idea and repeat earlier content, slowing momentum. Figurative language is straightforward but tendency toward abstraction and cliché (“brighter future,” “flickering flame of his faith”) keeps the line-level work from feeling sharp or economical.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    Line-level craft is grammatically correct, and some images (the mist-shrouded shore, the pulsing glow) are effective, but the prose is padded by redundancy and abstraction. Many sentences restate the same information (her determination, the guiding phrase, the journey beginning) with minor variations, which saps momentum. Phrases like “delicately robust” and “jaded wonder” verge on purple without adding precision, and emotional states are frequently told rather than embodied. The final third, in particular, loops through similar formulations of resolve and atmosphere instead of advancing tension or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally evocative, with some strong images (fruits like lanterns, silvery moonlight, electric anticipation). At the same time, it leans on repetition (“cosmic,” “essence,” “metamorphosis,” “paradoxically steady”) and explanatory phrasing that could be tightened for greater impact. Many sentences restate similar ideas about wonder, change, and harmony, slightly dulling momentum. There are no major figurative muddles, but the language tends toward safe, somewhat generic lyricism rather than precise, multi-purpose lines.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is mostly clean and evocative, with few grammatical issues and a clear throughline of imagery. That said, there is noticeable repetition of concepts and phrases (“cloudbound repentance,” “choking beauty,” mist and ozone), and several sentences repackage the same idea of lost time and understanding without new pressure. Figurative language occasionally veers toward purple without adding clarity. Line-level craft is above average but could be tightened for higher-impact density.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is grammatically clean and generally fluent, with some effective images (“faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs”). Yet there is noticeable repetition of phrases and concepts, and a tendency toward purple or abstract language that reduces density (“a testament to the ingenuity of her predecessors,” “boundless potential that lay hidden within the recesses of the human heart”). Many sentences rephrase similar emotional states without adding pressure or new detail. This results in mild momentum drag and a sense of over-telling in the closing passages.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but padded with redundancy and abstract phrasing (“the world was alive and pulsing with energy,” “the texture of transformation begin to reveal itself”). Key images and phrases are repeated almost verbatim without new pressure or nuance, causing momentum drag. Many sentences do only one job—restating theme—rather than advancing character or scene. Overall, the line-level work feels serviceable but verbose and slightly pseudo-profound rather than sharp and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose is competent but padded by redundancy and abstract phrasing (“sense of purpose and belonging,” “infused with a new sense of purpose”) that weaken impact. Many sentences repeat the same idea—darkness vs. light, new era, silent revolution—without adding new texture or pressure. Figurative language is safe and familiar, leaning into “glow,” “beacon of hope,” and similar clichés. Line-level craft sustains clarity but not momentum or freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, and the scene is easy to follow. However, it leans into repetition (“sacred patterns that governed the universe/reality,” “collapsed star dust”) and abstract phrasing that dilute impact. Figurative language is safe rather than sharp, and some lines verge on purple or redundant without adding pressure. The momentum is acceptable for a lyric piece but not especially taut or economical.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean and often pretty, but it leans heavily on repeated metaphoric frames: storms, turbulence, masks, scars, hidden patterns. Many sentences restate similar interior states or atmospheric qualities, creating mild paraphrase loops and purple over-saturation (“storm-kissed wonder,” “cartography of scars,” “detritus of her past”). Information density could be higher; several paragraphs could be compressed without loss of meaning or pressure. Momentum softens in the midsection as description and abstraction accumulate faster than new insight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean and occasionally striking, but it leans into repetition and abstraction—several sentences restate similar ideas about calm, duel, chaos, and journey. Key moments (“swords clashing in a flurry of steel and sparks”) rely on stock phrasing rather than specific, surprising language. Figurative and thematic terms (“hidden overture,” “dignified chaos”) recur without new facets, creating a mild sense of looped rhetoric. Momentum survives, but line-level craft feels more serviceable than incisive.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, and most sentences advance either mood or information without glaring clutter. However, there’s repetition at the conceptual level (variations on hope, resistance, rebuilding, purpose) and several paraphrase-like sentences that restate similar ideas. Metaphors (“phoenix from the ashes,” “broken dreams”) sometimes drift toward cliché rather than fresh image-making. Momentum remains acceptable for a reflective piece, but tighter line-level compression and more surprising figurative choices would lift this closer to publishable polish.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and consistently clear, with some strong images (“needles flickering… like fireflies,” “horizon was slowly beginning to invite night”). Yet there is noticeable repetition (mist, arbor, flickering compasses, time freezing) and a tendency toward purple or redundant phrasing in places. Many sentences do similar atmospheric work without adding new pressure or information, slightly dragging momentum. Figurative language largely holds together but could benefit from pruning for density and variety.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sentences are clear and correctly structured, and the piece is easy to follow at the line level. However, there is substantial redundancy—similar sentiments about urgency, blooming, and determination recur with only minor variation, which blunts momentum. Figurative language is straightforward but rarely surprising, and modifiers (“sweet scent,” “gentle hum,” “vibrant landscape”) accumulate without adding new information. The prose is serviceable and occasionally pleasant but lacks the compression and sharpness expected at a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is grammatically clean and easy to follow, with some pleasing images (the compass pointing “to a memory rather than a direction,” emotion “untangling” like lace threads). Yet there is substantial redundancy in both phrasing and content—similar sentiments about tranquility, regret, breeze, scent, and tides are reiterated without new pressure or nuance, creating scaffold-like loops. Figurative language trends toward the generic and sometimes over-literalizes symbolism, edging into purple without additional insight. This repetition dampens momentum and keeps the line-level work from feeling tightly edited or maximally efficient.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.4)
    Significant template cadence issues; five sentences begin with "As she/Maria..." and others use repetitive structures ("Maria's thoughts turned," "She realized"). The prose relies on clichés ("testament to the fury," "intricate dance," "fabric of the environment") and abstract nouns rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.3)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding; the phrase "she felt a sense of" appears seven times, and the sentence structure "As she [verb]..." is used six times. This mechanical repetition creates a monotonous rhythm and highlights the story's reliance on telling over showing. Abstract nouns ("harmony," "essence," "peace") replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("frazzled nerves," "ripples on a pond," "spoke directly to the heart," "fade away") and abstract telling. High density of filter verbs and emotive labels prevents the reader from experiencing the scene directly.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("fateful evening," "beckon him," "heart finally at peace") and lacks information density. Logical artifacts (dust underwater) disrupt the reading flow. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a simple subject-verb-summary pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=2.4)
    Prose is weighed down by extreme repetition of weak descriptors ("soft" appears ~8 times, "gentle" ~6 times) and filter verbs. The heavy reliance on "As..." dependent clauses to move time forward creates a dragging, repetitive cadence that kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is heavily filtered ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") and cluttered with abstract modifiers that dilute imagery ("foggy lucidity," "otherworldly energy"). The rhythm is monotonous, and the density of clichés in peak moments ("boundaries between reality and the mystical begin to blur") prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence openers ("As the...", "As they...", "As Elian...") and stock phrasing ("wisps of dawn mist," "laws of physics were mere suggestions"). These artifacts flatten the narrative rhythm and obscure specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("came tumbling down," "emerged from the shadows," "thick with dust," "beacon of hope") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are repetitive and functional, lacking propulsion or density. There is a high volume of filter verbs and abstract nouns that distance the reader from the physical reality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe template cadence issues ("As she worked," "As the aurora danced," "As the night wore on," "As the first light...") disrupt flow. The prose relies on clichés ("shattering of glass," "dull ache," "petals of a flower") and abstract phrasing rather than concrete, fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe overwriting, relying on cliché-ridden adjective-noun pairs ("fleeting golden sunset," "soft, ethereal light," "quietly savvy air"). Syntactic variety is poor, with a repetitive reliance on "As the [noun] [verb]" introductory clauses to bridge paragraphs. The density of purple prose obscures the action and drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("beacon of hope," "kaleidoscope of colors") and oxymoronic descriptors that confuse rather than clarify. Sentence structure is monotonously repetitive, with eight sentences beginning with "As" or "And as," creating a severe template cadence artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("shiver run down my spine," "just getting started") and filter verbs that dull immediacy. Sentence structure is repetitive, with a "template cadence" of "I [verb]... and [verb]" dominating the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.5)
    Line-level craft is marred by severe repetitive artifacts, including nine instances of "as if" and the verbatim repetition of "very fabric of reality." Imagery depends on worn similes ("dripped like honey") and lacks the concrete information density required for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition artifacts mar the prose; the phrase "remarkably composed" appears three times, and "second chance program" appears five times, creating a robotic, templated cadence. The sentence structure is repetitive ("As [clause], [subject] [verb]"), and the text relies heavily on passive telling rather than active showing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetitive phrasing creates a drumbeat of artifacts; "ambiguously clear," "resonant hush," "mistrust and secrecy," and "lens from a projector" each appear three to four times in a short text. Sentence structure is highly repetitive (Subject-Verb, As-clause openers), creating a sluggish rhythm. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("allure," "practicality," "essence") and clichés ("toil under the sun," "cycle of life") instead of specific imagery. The reliance on "would" constructions creates a repetitive, lethargic rhythm that stalls momentum and dilutes the scene's density.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by "purple" artifacts and awkward prompt insertions ("mechanically warm hands," "subdued awakenings stirring"). High density of stock metaphors ("kaleidoscope of colors") and adverbs weakens the momentum and clarity of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntactic repetition mars the prose; nine sentences begin with the identical "As [clause]..." structure (template cadence). Vocabulary loops ("lanterns flickered," "unstruck chords") occur frequently without accruing new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a monotonous rhythm; the construction "As she [verb]..." or "As [noun]..." is used to open sentences at least six times. The prose relies heavily on filtering and abstract "telling" rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose suffers from a fatal rhythmic loop, with nearly every paragraph or major action initiated by a dependent clause starting with "As they..." (8 instances). This repetitive scaffolding kills momentum. The text relies heavily on clichés ("shiver run down their spine," "mind racing," "devouring the words") and weak abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts characterize the prose, with "The chronicle keeper" beginning nearly every sentence, creating a robotic, scaffolded rhythm. Phrases like "regenerative silence," "untold seasons," and "obsidian refuge" are looped incessantly, destroying momentum and reading like a draft template.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a monotonous template cadence; nearly every paragraph opening relies on an "As [clause]" structure ("As the last wisps...", "As she played...", "As the moon...", "As the eclipse...", "As the sun...", "As they packed..."). The prose is riddled with filter verbs ("sensed," "saw," "knew") and abstract "It was [label]" constructions that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose density is extremely low due to pervasive clichés ("treasure trove," "echoes of the past," "fabric... alive") and repetitive syntactic patterns (multiple sentences starting with "As..." or "With..."). These artifacts and the lack of concrete imagery sever the reader's connection to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive phrasing and template cadence. Specific phrases ("spycraft microdot film specs," "transpose their life into a new key," "accidentally prophetic nature") are repeated verbatim in a short space, creating a loop effect that mimics low-quality generation. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract summary ("sensed," "intuited," "seemed") distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose is riddled with "As [noun] [verb]" template cadence (five instances), creating a monotonous rhythm. Phrases are looped repetitively ("whispers of the unknown," "unravel the stillness"). A significant malapropism ("plumping the depths" instead of plumbing) and the literalization of "rhetorical devices" as a plot action severely degrade quality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence structures, with six paragraphs beginning with "As [noun] [verb]..." (e.g., "As the first rays," "As they reached," "As the dawn light"). This creates a monotonous, scaffold-like rhythm. The text is dense with abstract nouns and mixed metaphors ("chronologically homesick aura") that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is laden with filter verbs ("she took a deep breath," "feeling," "saw," "thought") that distance the reader from the action. Abstract nouns and "purple" descriptors ("misty veil," "otherworldly light") replace concrete imagery, and sentence structures differ little in rhythm or length, creating a monotonous cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition of phrases ("rustle of turning seasons" x4, "enthrall" x3, "filament of hush" x2) creates a looping, unnatural rhythm. The prose relies on "purple" descriptors ("womb," "midwife," "sacred") that obscure clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "whirl with possibilities," "time seemed to stand still," "darkness deepened"). Mandatory phrases are inserted as clunky modifiers that disrupt the rhythm and feel artificial. There is significant "scaffold" text explaining what the character is doing rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe syntactic monotony and artifact looping destroy the prose quality; nearly half the paragraphs begin with "As [clause]." The phrase "sense of [emotion]" appears six times, and "wash over her" appears four times, indicating a total lack of lexical control and line-level variation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe repetitive looping penalizes this category heavily; "texture of time" appears six times and "impossible choices" four times in a short span, reading like a glitch. The prose creates no momentum, relying on scaffold structures ("As she strolled," "As she worked," "As the night wore on").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence issues, with seven sentences beginning with "As [noun] [verb]..." (e.g., "As she walked," "As she approached," "As she listened," "As the night wore on" twice). The phrase "chronic hush" is repeated six times, becoming a distracting artifact. Clichés abound ("glimmer of hope," "shards of ice," "tapestry"), and the text relies on abstract adjectives over concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is marred by severe repetition of full phrases ("fragrance chemist's blotter petal," "luminescent stones") and a monotonous "As [clause]" sentence cadence used over seven times. These text artifacts create a mechanical, list-like rhythm that deadens the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is laden with purple abstractions ("dissolved into the evening air") and clichéd similes ("flowed as smoothly as the sea breeze"). Information density is low due to a reliance on filter verbs and summary scaffolding that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition (variations of "shimmering/glimmering" and "community" appear frequently) and purple diction. Logic issues arise—a "marsh-reed sculptor" carving "obsidian" (stone/glass) is physically contradictory without explanation. The text relies on telling ("The thrill of the hunt was just what Kael needed") over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("wisps of dawn," "fabric of time," "window of opportunity," "swirling vortex"). A critical grammatical error occurs where a prompt phrase is forced into a sentence incompatible with it ("was being sculpts time itself").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with a high frequency of sentences beginning with "As [clause]" or "The [noun]." Abstract nouns and adjective-heavy descriptions ("gentle rustle," "soft creaking," "ethereal light") clutter the text and obscure concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive sentence scaffolding dulls the rhythm; six sentences begin with "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]" ("As they worked," "As they stood," "As the city's lights," etc.). The prose is laden with adjective-noun clichés ("unexpected outage," "soft light," "dimly lit") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is highly repetitive, with numerous sentences starting with "As [noun/pronoun]..." or "The [noun]...", creating a monotonous rhythm. The text suffers from extreme abstraction density, telling the reader about "intricate beauty" and "interconnectedness" rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=2.2)
    Line-level craft is poor, dominated by the "As I [verb]" template cadence and forced insertion of prompt phrases ("wryly earnest sense of purpose" is incoherent). Clichés abound ("wild goose chase," "fabric of reality," "torn asunder"), and "haggard awe" is repetitively pasted in.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("whispers of the wind," "fabric of reality," "web of energies") and relies heavily on abstract nouns and weak passive constructions. The density of "told" emotion and standard phrasing prevents any fresh imagery from taking hold. The oxymoronic phrasing ("steadily unpredictable") reads as awkward rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, relying on abstract "sense of" loops ("sense of renewal," "sense of absence," "sense of pride," "sense of satisfaction") and "testament to" phrases. This reliance on scaffolding instead of concrete imagery dilutes the narrative's impact and readability.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.3)
    The prose suffers from a severe, repetitive syntactic loop, with nearly every paragraph opening with "As [noun]..." or "With [noun]..." constructions. This drumbeat rhythm creates a mechanical feel that deadens the narrative momentum. The text is also dense with clichés ("hold its breath," "heart quickened," "living entity") that obscure rather than reveal meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is grammatically functional but cluttered with abstract nouns and adjectives ("unexpected surge," "otherworldly presence," "courageously kind determination"). The phrase "courageously kind determination" is a jarring, unnatural construction likely forced by the prompt, creating a distinct artifact. The reliance on passive construction and summary dulls the impact of every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from high density of clichés ("siren's song," "fabric of reality," "spark of intrigue") and abstract descriptors that dull imagery. Rhythm is monotonous, and the reliance on filter verbs and "telling" prevents immersion in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("steeled herself," "heart quickened," "surge of determination"). Prompt phrases like "liquefy the rigid thinking" are inserted awkwardly, disrupting the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.0)
    Sentence structure is repetitive and formulaic, heavily relying on "The [noun] [verb]..." and "As [clause]..." patterns (e.g., "As she worked," "As the sun rose," "As she walked"). The prose suffers from high artifact density, including mixed metaphors and forced phrasing like "incandescent restraint" applied to air, which confuses rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of sentence stems (the "As the [noun]..." construction appears six times) and relies heavily on abstract nouns ("complexities," "texture," "narrative") instead of concrete imagery. The text tells the reader what is happening ("piecing together a narrative") rather than showing the specific content of the stories or memories.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("whipping her hair into a frenzy," "stark contrast," "haunting melody") and purple abstractions ("essence of the observatory"). Sentence structures are repetitive and declarative, creating a droning rhythm that lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose is entirely abstract "telling" with significant repetitive sentence structures (multiple paragraphs beginning with "As..." or "The city..."). There is no sensory density, immediacy, or scenic momentum, only a dry recitation of events.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from scientific inaccuracy (wind on the moon) and repetitive diction (the phrase "poignant reminder" appears twice; "beauty" appears five times). Heavy reliance on adverbs and adjective-noun clusters ("purposefully curious gaze," "inexplicable connection") flattens the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("poured her soul," "beacon of... tranquility," "maiden voyage") and relies on weak filter verbs ("Emilia felt," "Emilia saw"). Repetitive sentence openers ("As she...", "The task...", "The drone...") create a monotonous rhythm that saps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=2.2)
    Line-level craft suffers from extreme repetitive sentence structures (ten instances of "As..." openings) and reliance on clichés ("shiver ran down her spine," "stars twinkled like diamonds"). The prose is padded with filler and abstract nouns, lacking the density and propulsion required for this score band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by repetitive sentence structures and passive "was [adjective]" constructions. The phrase "wild hush" is repeated three times as a static label, and the text relies on abstract filtering ("seemed to stir," "sensed a stirring") rather than concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.1)
    A significant tense shift occurs where the present-tense phrase "as time runs short" is pasted into past-tense narration, breaking causality and flow. The prose suffers from repetitive sentence openers ("As she...", "With a...") and relies heavily on clichés and abstract nominalizations.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence openers ("As he walked," "The boy felt") and pervasive clichés ("imagination running wild," "scent of salt and decay"). Metaphors are often mixed or illogical, such as the physical impossibility of seeing stories "through the scuffs."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of verbatim phrases ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "hush of winter-cracked fields," "lovingly venomous") which creates a looping artifact effect. Clichéd phrasing ("shiver run down her spine," "dark pools of water") and heavy use of "As [x], [y]" sentence structures dull the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=1.9)
    The prose is marred by significant repetition of verbatim phrases ("carve a path from ruin to reverence," "poetic wharf weaver," "power of art to transform") across the short text. Abstract phrasing ("broken precedents," "overlapping sleepwalking paths") replaces concrete imagery, resulting in low information density. The term "orchid solace" appears to be a hallucinated artifact used as a clumsy label.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is smooth but saturated with clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "drawn by an unseen thread," "window into a world"). Information density is low, with many sentences restating the protagonist's feelings rather than advancing the action. The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") disrupts the flow and feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe template cadence issues: the construction "As the [noun] [verb]..." is repeated six times, creating a monotonous rhythm. The prose is dense with clichés ("pulsate with energy," "whirlwind of color") and lacks information density.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("shake the very foundations," "change the course of history," "engulf... in chaos"). Sentence structure is repetitive (frequent "The embroiderer..." openers), creating a monotonous, scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive sentence scaffolding, specifically the "As [clause], [main clause]" structure which appears at least seven times ("As she moved," "As she navigated," "As the moonlight," etc.). The writing is clogged with abstract adjective-noun pairings ("profound significance," "ethereal voices") that reduce density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetitive sentence structure (template cadence); six paragraphs begin with "As [noun] [verb]..." (As the mist, As she worked, As the mist, As the anesthetic, As the darkness, As the anesthetic). The prose is cluttered with abstract noun phrases ("threads of a narrative," "threads of her experiences").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is heavily laden with modifiers and stock imagery ("heart of the," "vivid," "forsaken place," "reignite"), creating a dense, purple texture that lacks propulsion. Several required elements ("knowledge network," "pensive mirth") are inserted as awkward phrases that disrupt the rhythm and tone. The text relies on "filter" phrases ("she began to envision," "she knew that") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("swirling vortex," "fabric of reality," "time lost all meaning," "one with the universe") and forced rhymes ("itch to bewitch"). These artifacts stifle density and momentum, replacing concrete image with breathless abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is riddled with cliché ("unbreakable spirit," "beacon of hope," "testament to") and abstract summary. There are repetitive sentence starts ("As the days passed," "As the seasons passed," "As a result") that create a droning, synopsis-like rhythm. Significant telling prevents any scene density or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from low information density and a high frequency of clichés ("faded into memory," "balm to her soul," "stark contrast"). Metaphors are often mixed or decorative ("photosynthesize it into beauty"), and the reliance on adjective-noun pairings creates a sluggish pace without propulsive energy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=2.9)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive looping, recycling phrases like "deserted marvels," "forgotten names," and "gently systematic" verbatim multiple times (e.g., paragraphs 1 and 19). Heavy adjective stacking clogs the rhythm and results in a dense, static texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("shiver down her spine," "fabric of reality") and abstract metaphors that obscure physical action. The text relies heavily on "seemed to" constructions and repetitive "noun + verb + adverbial phrase" templates.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe syntactic repetition (at least six sentences begin with "As...") creates a droning, template-like cadence that kills momentum. The prose suffers from "purple" artifacts and semantic confusion ("slyly heartfelt warmth," "dappled resolve"), heavily favoring telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant cliché usage ("freshly fallen snow," "intricate web," "bright light of the day") which flattens the imagery. The "blooming withering" line creates a figurative muddle that confuses rather than deepens the description. Sentence structures are repetitive and lack propulsive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is severely marred by a "felt a sense of [noun]" artifact loop, appearing nine times (kinship, disorientation, peace, joy, love, etc.), which creates a monotonous, abstract texture. The writing lacks density, relying on padding like "world of wonder and awe."

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe syntactic monotony; nearly every paragraph relies on the "As [clause], [main clause]" structure. Egregious text loops occur, with the full setting name and abstract phrases ("luminous respite," "softly ingenious") repeated verbatim multiple times, creating a mechanical, filler-text quality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose is cluttered with filter verbs ("felt a sense of," "knew that," "realized"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The text suffers from severe repetitive phrasing (11 uses of "The recollectionist," 7 uses of "As she...") that deadens the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.2)
    Syntax is severely repetitive; 9 out of 26 sentences begin with the subordinate conjunction "As," creating a monotonous, rocking rhythm. The prose is laden with clichés ("twinkle like diamonds," "spell of enchantment") and abstract nouns that dilute imagery. This level of syntactic looping marks the draft as unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive syntax artifacts dominate the prose, specifically the "As she [verb]" dependent clause openers (seven instances) and the "Aria knew that" formulation (five instances). These loops, combined with purple descriptors ("otherworldly light," "sacred space"), stifle momentum and obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of phrasing ("She felt a sense of..." appears six times) and sentence templates ("As she...") creates a mechanical rhythm. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, and filter verb stacks dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence scaffolding; six paragraphs begin with "As he..." or "As the night...", creating a monotonous, droning rhythm. The text is cluttered with adjective-heavy clichés and filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is dense with filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "seemed to be") and abstract nouns, creating a barrier between reader and action. Clichés ("vast expanse," "ripple effect") replace fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic looping; nearly every paragraph begins with a temporal dependent clause ("As the last remnants...", "As the cartographer carefully...", "As night began..."). "It seemed" is repeated six times, creating a filter artifact that dulls immediacy. The reliance on abstract nouns and clichés ("mind's eye," "shiver run down their spine") replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers severely from template cadence, with eight sentences beginning with "As [clause]," creating a monotonous rhythm. Phrases like "possibilities that lay beyond," "essence," and "dusky harmony" are repeated verbatim or in slight variation, indicating a lack of lexical control and density.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("weight of centuries," "frazzled nerves," "bear fruit") and awkward prompt-forced phrasing ("operatively gentle hands"). Severe repetition of exact phrases ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "price of redemption") within a short space destroys narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("balm to her soul," "lifeblood," "foundations of the earth," "chain of events") and abstract phrasing that dulls the imagery. High density of "telling" summaries prevents immersion, and the rhythm is repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("seismic shift," "beacon of hope," "shedding the weight") and abstract metaphors that obscure the action. The confusion between the metaphorical "threads" and the physical "untangling" creates a causality break where the mechanism of the story's central turn is illegible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is heavily laden with clichés ("creative juices", "pulsing heart") and repetitive sentence openers ("As she..."). Prompt phrases like "meteor hush" and "half-lit epiphanies" are inserted repetitively, creating a mechanical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is marred by severe looping and padding; phrases like "sweet scent of blooming flowers," "soft hum of insects," and "interrupted cadence" are repeated verbatim in the final paragraphs. The text relies on purple abstractions ("blushing stillness," "suspended animation") instead of concrete imagery. These unmotivated repetitions and stock descriptions stall momentum and obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("labor of love," "moment of truth," "peace and accomplishment") that dull the imagery. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "She [verb], [participial phrase]" pattern, and specific prompt phrases ("snowmelt ardor") are shoehorned in awkwardly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract noun phrases ("complex dance of understood events," "intricate web of causality") and cliché ("testament to forgotten endeavors"). There are repetitive phantom-adjective constructions ("precisely playful grace," "precisely playful manner") that act as text artifacts. The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation or density required for high-quality fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is saturated with purple language, mixed metaphors, and clichés (&quot;shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake,&quot; &quot;wings of a dusky harmony,&quot; &quot;veil between the worlds&quot;). There is significant synonym churn and abstract noun stacking that obscures concrete imagery. The reliance on filter verbs (&quot;felt,&quot; &quot;sensed,&quot; &quot;knew&quot;) distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is grammatically functional but saturated with clichés ("beacon of hope," "ebbs and flows," "torn apart by conflict," "new beginning"). The reliance on abstract adjectives and passive constructions creates a lack of line-level propulsion and vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose relies on clichés ("eyes lit up with a spark," "heart swelled," "just out of reach") that dull the imagery. "Inexplicable connection" acts as a scaffold to bypass the work of describing the relationship between character and object. The diction is repetitive ("shimmer," "frost") without rhythmic variation or accumulation of power.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("piece of Elara's heart," "old friends sharing secrets," "heart of the abandoned cathedral") and abstract nouns. Sentences often function as scaffolding to explain emotional intent rather than delivering high-density imagery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, relying on a "template cadence" of sentence openers ("As they strolled," "As they made their way," "As they entered," "As they stood," "As they left"). Clichés abound ("shimmering like stardust," "pieces of a puzzle falling into place," "curiosity got the better of them"). The writing tells rather than shows throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose suffers from "telling" and clichéd phrasing ("heart swelled," "thrum of excitement") that flattens the impact. Key descriptors are repeated ("labyrinthine bookstore") or used as labels ("carefully resourceful") rather than integrated into the action or logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=2.0)
    A severe syntactic tic dominates the prose: 7 out of roughly 18 sentences begin with the subordinate conjunction "As" ("As the fog...", "As she navigated...", "As she opened..."), creating a monotonous, droning rhythm. The text is saturated with clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "treasure trove of secrets," "eyes fixed on the horizon").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive sentence scaffolding; seven paragraphs begin with "As she..." or "As Emilia..." or "As they..." creating a monotonous rhythm. The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and clichés ("hairs on the back of her neck," "piqued curiosity").

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding, with "The mapkeeper" starting the majority of sentences, creating a dull, plodding rhythm. There is a high density of "told" emotion and abstract description ("honed it to a fine art," "deep connection") instead of active verbs and specific imagery. The text relies on "template cadence," looping similar sentence structures without narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers severely from a template cadence loop, with six paragraphs beginning with or driven by "As they..." constructions. Clichés ("shiver run down their spine," "frozen in time") and repetitive phrasing ("With the shard... clutched in their hand") destroy rhythm and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=2.3)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with six sentences beginning with "As she [verb]" (e.g., "As she stood," "As she reached"). High density of clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "twinkling like diamonds," "flood through her") and low information density make the writing feel algorithmic and unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers severely from repetitive sentence structures, specifically the "As [clause], [main clause]" pattern, which appears seven times, creating a monotonous, droning rhythm. The text relies heavily on abstract nouns and clichés ("lit up the night sky," "canvas waiting to be filled," "etched in her mind") instead of concrete imagery. There is a lack of syntactic variety and freshness at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is riddled with clichés ("texture of time," "fabric of reality," "intricate web") and repetitive phrasing ("warmly observant" appears twice as a label). The writing tells rather than shows, using abstract nouns where concrete imagery is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.0)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract pairings ("expectant stillness," "serene presence") and clichés ("seeds taking root," "rich tapestry"). Sentence structures are repetitive ("As the...", "Eli..."), and the density of adjectives slows momentum without adding concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely repetitive, with 7 of 11 paragraphs beginning with the same "As [clause], [subject] [verb]..." syntactic structure, creating a monotonous rhythm. The writing is dense with clichés ("last echo," "summer breeze," "soothing balm") and lacks active, concrete verbs, relying instead on static description.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers severely from template cadence, specifically the repetitive use of "As [clause], [main clause]" structures (six instances, including "As she stepped," "As she worked," "As the night wore on," "As the first light," etc.). This syntactical monotony creates a droning rhythm. Phrasing relies on clichés ("mere shadow of its former self," "steeled herself," "coursing through her veins").

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from significant flaws, including a subject-verb agreement error ("they burns bridges"), misused diction ("encroach upon this decline"), and cliché strings ("phoenix from the ashes," "slumbering giant"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "The [noun] [verb]" pattern that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("depths of," "ethereal light," "fabric of reality," "nexus of two worlds") that deaden the imagery. Sentences are functional but lack rhythm or fresh vocabulary, often resorting to "She felt [emotion]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe repetitive phrasing disrupts the flow; the noun phrase "dynasty ender" appears over 20 times in a short text, creating a distracting drumbeat. The writing relies heavily on clichés ("first yawn of evening," "never be the same") and abstract nouns instead of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition ("shape of possibility" appears six times; "reality shifted/shifting" four times; "mystical energies" three times). Phrases like "factually mystical atmosphere" read as awkward insertions, and the reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns dilutes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés (&quot;trove of forgotten memories,&quot; &quot;beacon of a story untold&quot;) and suffers from severe syntactic repetition; six sentences begin with &quot;As&quot; clauses (&quot;As a broken-hearted...&quot; &quot;As she delicately...&quot; &quot;As she worked...&quot;), creating a monotonous, droning rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract noun clusters ("spirit of resistance," "fabric of the established order") and passive constructions that sap momentum. "Tell" dominates "show" completely, with high-level summaries replacing scene work. There are frequent "scaffold" sentences that announce what is happening ("Aria's motivation was clear") rather than letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.5)
    Pervasive use of filter verbs ("seems to," "as if") and repetitive sentence openers ("As she," "As the") creates a sluggish, distancing rhythm. Key phrases ("vested hush," "quietly vivid") are repeated awkwardly, and the prose relies on abstract nominalizations that kill momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=1.9)
    The prose is riddled with "synonym churn" and "text loops," specifically the verbatim repetition of long noun phrases ("Moonstone cabochon dust speck," "ashen skyborne arbor") and the exact reprise of the "hush where past meets prophecy" line. These artifacts destroy immersion and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence artifacts; nearly every paragraph transition relies on "As he [verb]..." constructions (7+ instances). Repetitive diagnostic phrasing ("sense of calm," "sense of purpose," "sense of clarity") flattens the emotional texture. Clichés like "testament to" and "unwinding before him like a river" further dilute the writing quality.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.1)
    The text suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with six paragraphs relying on "As [time/action]..." constructions to advance the narrative. Phrasing is often abstract and adjective-heavy ("luminous regret," "otherworldly light") rather than concrete and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntactic monotony; the construction "As [action], [result]" is used eight times in a very short text, creating a droning, repetitive rhythm. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("she spotted," "she felt," "she heard") and adjectival stacking ("faint, flickering light") that dilutes density.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("eyes snapped open," "tears streamed," "senses screamed") and abstract nouns. The reliance on telling over showing distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.4)
    Prose is dense with filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "saw") and cliché descriptors ("eyes that seemed to see right through her," "shiver run down her spine"). Key concepts are rendered as abstract nouns ("anchors of intuition") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition artifacts ("weightless burden" x3, "secrets" x6, "uncovered" x4) and template cadence ("As she..." appears 6+ times) drag the score down. The prose relies on clichés ("swallows her whole," "frozen in time") and synonym churn rather than fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés and stock phrases ("shrouded in mystery," "quiet reverence," "fabric of reality," "torn asunder," "legacy lived on"). Adjective-noun pairings are predictable ("soft, ethereal light," "viscous liquid"), and the rhythm is lulling rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping and synonym churn; specific phrases are repeated verbatim multiple times ("burnished sorrow," "poetically inclined nature," "flowing like a river," "labyrinthine passages and forgotten artifacts"). Sentence structure is monotonous, frequently relying on "As [clause], she [action]" constructions. These artifacts suggest a lack of line-level control and revision.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and abstraction ("manifestation of his deep understanding," "fabric of silence"), reducing information density. The phrase "tinkersong wonder" appears twice as a jarring, prompt-inserted label, and the reliance on filter verbs ("Erebus sensed," "Erebus believed") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with five paragraphs beginning with "As she..." or similar dependent clauses, creating a droning rhythm. Clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "palpable sense of expectation") and redundant phrasing ("luminescent fungi... luminescent") further degrade the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("testament to," "ravages of time," "flotsam and jetsam") and passive, abstract constructions that dull the imagery. Information density is low, with many sentences devoted to explaining the character's thoughts instead of showing her interaction with the physical world.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe syntactic repetition mars the prose, with a pervasive "As [clause], [clause]" template appearing in nearly every paragraph. Over-reliance on filter verbs and abstract nouns creates a "telling" mode that blocks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is saturated with clichés and stock phrases ("eyes scanning," "thick with the scent," "winding path," "face etched with lines," "heart ablaze"). There is a high density of filter verbs and telling, which flattens the imagery and robs the scene of immediacy and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("breathe new life," "reborn from the ashes," "fierce determination") and abstract summarization. There is a high density of filter verbs and telling, which obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene. Sentence structures are repetitive and lack propulsive energy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe repetition undermines the prose: "life of their/its own" appears three times, and "wax cylinder phonograph shaving" is repeated in full four times. "Seemed to be" appears five times, and the transitional phrase "As the night wore on" is used twice verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.0)
    Syntactic monotony is severe; seven sentences begin with "As [noun] [verb]" or similar dependent clauses, creating a repetitive, droning rhythm. The prose is dense with clichés ("fabric of time and space," "into the unknown," "delicate balance") and abstract phrasing that obscures concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=2.9)
    Tense confusion arises from the prompt insertion "After the glue dries" (present) into a past-tense narrative ("beauty... was revealed"). The prose relies heavily on clichés ("gentle whisper," "heart of the sanctuary," "symphony of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, recycling specific phrases ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness," "strength in vulnerability") multiple times as a crutch. Text artifacts in the form of scaffold transitions ("As the night wore on," "As the night deepened") dominate the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.2)
    A severe syntactic loop destroys the prose's rhythm; eight sentences begin with the identical "As the [noun] [verb]..." construction. The text is further weighed down by cliché phrases ("sands of time," "ravaged expanse") and a lack of lexical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a robotic rhythm; nearly a third of the sentences begin with "As [clause]," and most others start with "The [noun]." Abstract nouns and clichés ("relentless march of time," "palpable excitement") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("gentle lapping," "soothing melody," "echo the rhythm of her heart") and purple abstractions. Grammatical awkwardness appears in the insertion of required elements ("wrapped warmly attentive"), and the text suffers from low information density due to repetitive descriptions of peace and beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=1.9)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("gently systematic approach," "brazen calm," "botanical diary") creates a mechanical, template-like quality. The prose consists almost entirely of "telling" summaries with scaffolded sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic monotony, with a pervasive reliance on "As [subject] [verb]" introductory clauses (six distinct instances) that creates a droning template cadence. The text is dense with clichés ("unblinking gaze," "palpable," "promenade") and repetitive scaffolding that dulls all momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe repetition creates a tedious rhythm; the phrase "air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers" (or variations) appears three times. Sentence structures are formulaic and repetitive, and the text is filled with abstract fillers like "promise of new life" rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose suffers from awkward, forced phrasing ("tinted revelations," "intuitively descriptive") that disrupts semantic logic and clarity. Frequent use of filter verbs and clichés ("stars twinkled," "eyes lit up") flattens the imagery and reduces narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("shrouded in mystery," "insatiable urge," "beckon her") and passive constructions that kill momentum. Repetitive sentence structures ("It was then that...", "As she...") create a droning rhythm. The text relies on telling ("beauty still captivating") where specific imagery is required.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with adjectival padding ("rich, burnished hue," "gentle, ethereal music") and stock phrasing ("swirling vortex," "reverent hands"). The phrase "cautious abandon" is used twice verbatim, creating a repetitive artifact that highlights the lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés and stock phrasing ("eyes locked," "air was thick," "unspoken words," "glimmer of understanding"). Several lines act as scaffolding to explain symbols rather than advancing the action, and the density of "tell" statements prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.4)
    Line-level execution is marred by clichés ("pores of... being", "danced like restless spirits") and awkward phrasing forced by constraints ("reached out via the texture of a feather"). The prose lacks propulsion, relying on long, modifying clauses that obscure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=1.9)
    Severe repetitive sentence scaffolding (six paragraphs begin with or prominently feature "As he..." or "As the...") destroys momentum. The prose is laden with clichés ("mind's eye," "weight... lifting," "ebbing of a tide") and awkward phrasing ("fidgeted productively") that fails the density and freshness tests.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition and padding in the final third, with the same phrases ("refract the truth," "price of forgiveness," "power of art") looping across multiple paragraphs. This redundancy halts narrative momentum and reads like a generation artifact or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.0)
    A severe template cadence artifact undermines the prose: eight of the nine paragraphs begin with the same "As [clause], [main clause]" structure. This creates a monotonous, rocking rhythm that kills narrative momentum. Clichéd phrasing ("washed over her," "bygone era") further dilutes the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("sun dipped below the horizon," "shattered her reverie," "melted away"). There are significant repetitive loops (the phrase "world around her melted away" appears twice in similar contexts). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant "purple prose" and repetitive sentence structures (multiple sentences starting with "As he..." or "He had..."). There are literal text loops ("gentle, insistent voice," "vibrations of intent," "light... danced across the waves") that stall momentum. The density of adjectives and adverbs obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("canvas of shadows and light," "singular purpose," "open wound," "strange comfort," "beacon of hope," "brighter future"). Sentence structures are repetitive, and the phrase "raw solace" is reused awkwardly. The density of filter verbs and stock metaphors prevents any sharp, fresh imagery from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe mechanical repetition, specifically a "template cadence" where nearly every paragraph relies on the "As they [verb]" sentence structure (e.g., "As they searched," "As they continued," "As they pored," "As they delved"). This creates a droning rhythm that kills momentum. High density of filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") further distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from distracting repetition of full phrases ("dried Edelweiss boutonnière," "witnessed isolation") and excessive scaffolding. The density of filter verbs and abstract nouns ("memory," "longing," "resolve") flattens the line-level impact and obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe syntactic repetition mars the prose; nine sentences begin with the stem "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]..." and nearly ten follow the "The [noun], now [modifier], [verb]..." template. This algorithmic cadence flattens the rhythm and draws attention to the scaffolding over the story.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetitive artifact: the construction "sense of [noun]" appears over ten times in a short text (e.g., sense of purpose, trepidation, lacy menace, wonder, unease, determination). Additionally, "tiny lanterns flickering like tiny stars" creates a redundancy loop.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by a repetitive "sense of [noun]" loop, appearing eight times in a short text ("sense of wonder," "sense of connection," "sense of peace," etc.). This is a major artifact that flattens emotional nuance. Additionally, clichés such as "time seemed to lose all meaning" and "the world around her melted away" degrade the line-level quality to generic filler.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from high cliché density ("stark reminder," "tangled threads," "take on a life of their own," "set my imagination ablaze") and repetitive sentence structures. The reliance on abstract summary ("Time lost all meaning," "distilling chaos into narrative") obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is marred by pleonasms ("misty morning fog") and the repetition of stock phrases ("trembling calm," "ordinary miracles," "emotional terrain") within a short space. The reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs creates a sluggish, passive rhythm that fails to engage the "read-aloud" ear.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive sentence structure undermines the prose; nearly every paragraph transition or action beat begins with "As [clause]" ("As the budding...", "As he lifted...", "As Kaito's mind...", "As he exhaled...", "As the words...", "As the last words..."). This template cadence creates a droning rhythm. Phrasing leans on clichés ("breathtaking sunset," "defy gravity").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from a severe repetitive loop of "As [pronoun] [verb]" sentence openers ("As she worked," "As she did so," "As she finished," "As she left"). Heavy reliance on clichés ("palpable sense," "ethereal light") and filter verbs dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is laden with abstract nouns and clichés ("fading light of day," "resounding hush") that obscure rather than reveal. The reliance on filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") and passive constructions saps momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with over eight sentences beginning with "As the [noun]..." (a Template Cadence artifact) which creates a droning rhythm. Phrasing relies heavily on clichés ("whirred to life," "warm orange glow," "soothing balm"), and there is a tense shift error ("scanned... they squint").

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is functional but repetitive, with a high frequency of "As she [verb]" sentence openers and "She [verb]" constructions. The writing suffers from abstraction and "telling" rather than "showing," failing to create dense, concrete imagery. Filter verbs and passive realizations rob the prose of momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from abstraction and cliché ("shiver run down her spine," "heart felt a little lighter"). The phrase "clover melancholy" is used twice as a label for an emotion that is never described or earned, creating a jarring artifact. The pacing is sluggish, bogged down by summary and lack of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, recycling words like "haunting" (3x), "hum" (4x), "connection" (4x), and "loop" (3x) in a short space. It relies on empty, telling adjectives ("curious," "peculiar," "special," "beautiful," "ethereal") that block visualization and flatten density.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is riddled with clichés ("ripple effect," "bygone era," "ethereal glow") and repetitive sentence structures. There are significant text artifacts, including the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases ("whenever context changes," "proximate causes") that disrupt syntactic flow. The final third of the story consists of repetitive paraphrase loops re-stating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition (the phrase "As the night wore on" opens two consecutive paragraphs) and relies on clichés ("skeletal fingers," "fabric of reality"). There is a high density of filter verbs and abstract constructions ("It was as if") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, specifically the phrase "quiet blaze" used three times (lines 15, 20, 24), including at the closure beat. Abstract nouns ("energies," "essence," "symphony") crowd out concrete imagery, and sentence structures fall into a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is weighted down by abstract nouns ("significance," "potential," "essence") and weak adjective-noun pairings ("strange comfort," "inexplicable connection"). Clichéd imagery ("fragile as a spider's web") and repetitive sentence structures dampen narrative momentum and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("face a map of emotions," "symphony of sound," "etched on his heart"). Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, resulting in "purple" description that lacks density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("heavy with the scent," "off the grid," "spark of inspiration," "heart of the desert"). "Volcanic tenderness" is a jarring mixed metaphor that disrupts the tone. Sentence structures are repetitive and lack rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("beacon of hope," "twinkled like diamonds") and abstract summarization that kills momentum. Repetitive sentence structures and a lack of sensory specificity result in a low information density.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence artifacts, with at least six sentences beginning with the "As she [verb]" construction ("As she walked," "As she turned," "As she unfolded"). This repetitive scaffolding kills momentum. The text is also dense with clichés ("glint of metal," "heart beating with anticipation," "chorus of restless spirits").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetitive phrasing degrades the prose; "stillwater tension" and "testament to" each appear four times, acting as filler. "Spiralingly calm" is an awkward artifact, and the lexical range is limited, cycling through "intricate," "pattern," and "calm" excessively.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is cluttered with purple phrasing ("hush where past meets prophecy," "liminal hour") and abstract nouns ("status quo," "thoughtfulness," "unity") that obscure visual clarity. Repetitive phrasing ("forests of second thoughts," "humble rebellion") acts as a crutch rather than a motif. The reliance on telling over showing robs the narrative of density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is laden with clichés ("shivers down spine," "lotus blooming") and redundancies ("lithe and agile"). The required phrase "combative tenderness" is inserted awkwardly as a label rather than evoked through style.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("poignant reminder," "bittersweet," "hypnotic spell"), passive voice, and abstract nouns. There is a high density of filtering and telling, with almost no concrete imagery or active verbs to drive the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with "purple" descriptors and mixed metaphors ("wove a tapestry... echoed," "paraphrase the whispers"). Sentence structures rely on repetitive scaffold ("As she stood there," "With each step," "As the poem took shape"), creating a monotonous rhythm that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("whirlwind of creativity," "hands moved with a life of their own," "shining example"). Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, and "telling" sentences dominate ("The painter's motivation was clear"). There is no rhythm or propulsion, only a flat, expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=1.8)
    The inclusion of a meta-commentary breaking the fourth wall at the end ("to meet the word count") is a fatal flaw that renders the piece unpublishable. Throughout the text, the prose is burdened by cliché ("sparkled with curiosity," "weave a tapestry") and abstract nouns ("texture of connection") that obscure concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns ("essence," "energy," "oneness") and repetitive phrasing ("sense of," "seemed to"). The forced insertion of prompt phrases ("genuinely artificial") and the repetition of the thematic statement create significant drag and artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe template cadence artifacts are present; nearly every paragraph opens with "As [noun] [verb]" (8+ instances), destroying momentum and density.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from basic usage errors ("poured over" instead of "pored over") and shoehorned prompt phrases ("steadily unpredictable curiosity") that create logical friction. Repetitive phrasing ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia") and a lack of sentence variety create a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive scaffolding disrupts the reading experience; six paragraphs begin with the identical "As she [verb]..." structure. The verbatim repetition of the complex phrase "metamorphose her understanding into a deeper insight" reads as a mechanical insertion rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetition of stock phrases ("shimmering stillness," "misty workshop," "quietly vivid") creates a looping effect. The prose is dense with mixed and stacked metaphors ("damp veil," "living entity," "crucible," "glass vessel") that clutter the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("shrouded in mist," "weight of centuries," "final piece of a puzzle," "boundless sea"). Sentence structures are repetitive, often relying on "As [clause]" openers. The density of "stock metaphor strings" and worn-out phrasing severely hampers literary freshness and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is dense with abstractions ("inexplicable pull," "hidden truth") and clichés ("swirled like autumn leaves") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "found themselves") robs the narrative of immediacy and places a barrier between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.3)
    The prose is marred by repetitive loops (three uses of "remembered stardust," two of "shadowed rapture," two of "tracing the path") and a monotonous sentence rhythm. High adjective density and stock phrasing ("velvet expanse," "ethereal glow") obscure clarity and drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    Prose is overwritten and laden with clichés ("ethereal glow," "kaleidoscope of color," "breathtaking spectacle"). Adjective stuffing weakens the imagery, and "wave functions" is used as a magical catch-all term without physical grounding. Sentence rhythm is repetitive, often following a noun-verb-adjective pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of stock phrases ("Mechanical rainforest," "hum of insight," "wind rustled") which halts momentum. The reliance on abstract telling over showing ("unravel the mysteries," "probabilities," "miracles") creates a barrier to engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from pervasive clichés ("palpable force," "balm to their souls," "inner light") and repetitive sentence structures ("As the...", "The [noun]..."). Key phrases like "gentle persistence" and "shoreline lullaby" are repeated verbatim, creating a stagnant rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping, with phrases like "nerve regeneration was a slow process," "cost of safety," and "sense of peace" repeated verbatim or in slight variation without accrual of meaning. The text is dense with clichés ("slow to a crawl," "heavy blanket"), and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("mists of time," "glittering stars," "moment of truth," "facade crumbled") that dull the imagery. Frequent use of passive constructions and filtering verbs ("Kael knew," "Kael saw") creates distance and saps the narrative of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by a dense cluster of clichés ("gaping void," "melt away," "shrouded in mist," "spirit soar") and repetitive sentence structures starting with the protagonist's name. Required phrases are inserted with broken grammar ("tone of her thoughts was drifting moored"), damaging clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés and abstract phrasing ("testament to," "palpable energy," "glimmer of hope," "coursing through her very being"). This lack of fresh imagery and reliance on stock metaphors ("reignite the flame") drains the narrative of immediacy and literary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.2)
    The text suffers from a high density of clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "course through her veins," "heart quickened") and repetitive sentence structures. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") pervade the narrative, dulling immediacy and agency. The prose functions merely to convey information rather than to build atmosphere or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("branding iron," "beacon of light," "withered fingers") and relies on abstract "telling." The density of stock phrases and therapy-speak ("somatic markers") prevents any genuine textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("shrouded in mystery," "beacon in the night," "true north," "hallowed halls") and scaffolded sentence structures. Meta-narrative tags ("she posed another rhetorical question") break the fourth wall clumsily.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is weighed down by excessive adjectival modification (e.g., "soothing balm," "unsettling pale blue," "soft, ethereal light") and clichés ("forged in the fire"). This over-modification creates a sluggish rhythm and reduces information density.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is heavily overwritten and ridden with clichés ("shiver ran down her spine," "spilled out like a dark confession," "digital winds," "chain of events"). The density of modifiers ("practiced intensity," "serene veil") clogs the rhythm and obscures the action, reducing clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose suffers from severe "template cadence" artifacts, with nearly every paragraph opening or transitioning with "As [X]..." clauses. The phrase "senselessly perceptive" is awkward usage that distracts rather than illuminates. Abstract nouns (tranquility, continuity, disorder) replace concrete imagery, and the text is full of scaffold phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.2)
    Significant repetition of stock phrases ("patterns break themselves," "feral lullaby," "As the night wore on") creates a looping artifact effect. The prose is abstract ("transliterate emotions") and relies on weak sentence openers that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=2.0)
    Severe repetition of scaffold phrases ("orbits of regret" appears four times; "rosewood pen nib" four times; "echoing observatory" three times) creates a distracting loop effect. The prose relies on clichés ("shrouded the world," "face it head-on") and lacks sentence-level propulsion, resulting in a stagnant, circular rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe repetitive scaffolding disrupts the flow, with seven paragraphs beginning with variations of "As [noun] [verb]" or "It was then." The prose is saturated with clichés ("shivers down her spine," "pour out their heart," "new beginnings," "petals of a flower") that flatten the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe repetitive flaws mark the prose, specifically a "template cadence" where nearly every paragraph progresses with "As [subject] [verb]..." constructions. Specific phrases ("lilac unease," "emergent hush," "whispering gallery") are looped repeatedly (3-4 times each) in a short space, creating a droning, artificial rhythm that obscures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from clunky, unmotivated phrasing, particularly the insertion of prompt elements like "retrocognitively trapped" and "via the chipped patterns," which break the register. Over-reliance on abstract nouns and adjectives ("overwhelming devastation," "quiet determination") flattens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding, with nearly every paragraph beginning with "As..." or "The...". Heavy use of filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") and clichés ("swirling vortex," "ethereal realm") creates a dense, opaque texture that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive strain; the phrase "muscovite geode sliver" appears seven times in a very short text, twice in identical "clutched in her hand" clauses. Additionally, five paragraphs begin with the same "As [clause]" template, creating a monotonous, robotic cadence that kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=2.3)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a droning template cadence; seven paragraphs or beats rely on an "As [action], [reaction]" sentence stem. This artifact flattens the rhythm and kills narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns and cliché metaphors ("threads of stories," "tapestry," "fabric of time"). There is significant synonym churn and repetitive sentence structure that creates a sluggish rhythm. The text tells rather than shows, relying on adjectives to do the work of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with phrases like "silver hush," "prudently daring," and "engraved pillbox" each repeated three times in a short text. The writing relies on "telling" and weak "to be" verbs, lacking density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.2)
    High density of similes (seven "like" constructions) dilutes immediacy. "Ambient awareness" creates a jarring register break (technical/clinical term in a mythic setting), and keyword phrases feel pasted in.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=2.8)
    Pervasive filtering ("felt," "saw," "seemed," "knew") creates a barrier between reader and action. Clichés ("sun beat down," "inexplicable connection") and repetitive sentence structures drain momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe template cadence artifacts are present; six paragraphs begin with "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]..." ("As they pruned," "As they worked," "As the night wore on," etc.). This creates a droning rhythm that kills propulsion. The prose relies heavily on abstraction and cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.8)
    A severe template cadence artifact disrupts flow: six paragraphs are driven by repetitive "As [clause]" constructions ("As the last wisps," "As she worked," "As the day wore on," "As the sun dipped"). Abstract phrasing often replaces concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from a critical structural artifact: eight sentences begin with the identical "As [clause]" construction, destroying rhythm and momentum. The text is saturated with clichés ("soothing balm," "gentle lapping," "fading light") and abstract nouns. The high density of "tell" statements ("The resulting artwork was a kaleidoscope") robs the imagery of power.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=2.3)
    Prose suffers from severe template cadence, repeatedly using "As [clause]" and "With [noun]" sentence openers. High density of filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "she became aware") and scaffold phrases strips the scene of immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with eight sentences beginning with "As..." constructions that create a monotonous, sleepy rhythm. The text is dense with clichés ("burning need," "forgotten history," "heart of... machine") and purple padding ("last wisps," "eerie silence"). Cause and effect are often obscured by ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with at least seven paragraphs beginning with "As [subject] [verb]..." ("As the artist worked," "As the mist swirled," "As the portrait neared," etc.). This repetitive structure kills momentum. The text relies on clichés ("interplay of light and shadow," "venture into the unknown") and passive constructions ("She was known for," "It was a poignant reminder").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose relies heavily on telling over showing, with frequent use of abstract nouns, passive constructions, and clichés ("shiver run down her spine"). Repetitive sentence openers ("As the...", "The...") and the awkward, repeated phrasing of "spongey dread" create a mechanical, unpolished rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is saturated with stock metaphors and clichés ("wisps of fog," "shiver ran down their spine," "river of light," "unfolding... like a map"). Phrase loops occur (the "ashes of 'never'" line is repeated verbatim). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") distance the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacts, notably the phrase "dusky harmony" appearing three times in a short text. The writing relies on clichés ("soothing serenade," "slumbered under the dusky sky") and abstract nouns rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is ridden with clichés ("shone bright," "beacon of hope," "golden age of prosperity," "gentle hum"). Sentence structure is repetitive and passive. Density is low, with many sentences devoted to explaining Lyra's backstory or mental state rather than showing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=1.7)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive syntax, specifically a template cadence loop where six sentences begin with "As they [verb]" ("As they ventured," "As they walked," "As they drew closer," etc.). Additionally, there is a high density of filter verbs ("seemed to pulsate," "seemed to shift," "seemed to stir") that distances the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition; seven sentences begin with "As she..." or "As the...", creating a monotonous, droning rhythm. Clichés abound ("shiver ran down her spine," "hidden in plain sight"), and the insertion of prompt phrases is clumsy and disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from abstract "telling" and forced insertion of prompt phrases ("fiercely gentle," "inlay meaning everywhere") that create logical and stylistic friction. Clichéd imagery ("skeletal fingers," "hidden truth," "holes in her soul") dominates, and the sentence structure becomes repetitive. The density of adjectives slows the pace without adding concrete information.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("echoes of applause faded," "symphony of possibilities," "celestial map," "weight... lifting"). Sentence structure is repetitive, often following a "He did X, feeling Y" pattern. The density of purple prose obscures the actual action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from a severe template cadence issue, with six paragraphs beginning with the construction &quot;As [clause], [subject]...&quot; (e.g., &quot;As the last wisps...&quot;, &quot;As she stood there...&quot;, &quot;As she worked...&quot;). This repetitive syntax creates a droning rhythm that kills momentum. Additionally, the text repeats specific phrases verbatim (&quot;As the last wisps,&quot; &quot;As she stood there&quot;) and relies on abstract nouns over concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and passive scaffolding ("was a reflection," "was not just"), lacking sentence-level propulsion. The usage of "smelt" as a noun for a process is awkward, and the rhythm is monotonous and lacking in concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of the "X, it seemed" construction, constituting a distraction that breaks immersion. Clichés abound ("breathtaking," "beacon of hope," "treacherous landscapes"), and filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dilute the immediacy of the experience. The writing relies on telling rather than showing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe repetitive phrasing ("testament to" appears 4 times; "The world, it seemed" or similar variants appear 3 times) creates a distracting algorithmic cadence. Abstract nouns ("solace," "journey," "truth") clutter the prose, displacing concrete imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is functional but marred by repetitive phrasing ("mist-shrouded," "unfolding cipher") and reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs. The prompt phrase "cautious exuberance" is pasted in twice verbatim, and the "propagation delays" line creates a jarring register clash with the fantasy tone. Clichés dominate the descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("open book," "sands of time," "velvet cloak," "no matter the cost") that flatten the imagery. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Subject verbs, modifier" pattern that kills momentum. The insertion of specific phrases like "mulberry ache" creates jarring, forced similes that disrupt the reading flow.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("ethereal curtains," "wispy clouds," "kaleidoscope of colors," "profound silence," "pang of sorrow") that flatten the imagery. Sentence structure is repetitive, with multiple paragraphs opening with similar dependent clauses ("As she worked," "As the light," "In this state"). The writing lacks freshness and specific, concrete nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with nearly every paragraph introduction relying on "As she [verb]" constructions ("As she worked," "As she climbed," "As she sat"). Phrase repetition is excessive and awkward, particularly "vineyard hush" (4x) and "kindly decisive nature" (2x), which appear to be forced insertions rather than organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("beacon of hope," "web of fears," "threads of a fishing net") and abstract telling. There is a repetitive sentence structure (multiple paragraphs beginning with "As the..." or "As they..."), creating a monotonous rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is marred by severe repetition of phrases ("sycamore hush" x4, "patterns" x5, "deep/deeper" x5) and abstract boilerplate. The narrative relies on "to be" verbs and weak scaffolding ("As she observed," "As the trance," "As they stood") that drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetitive scaffolding, particularly the phrase "As the dust continued to fall" and sentence openers like "The skimmer's [noun]." The reliance on weak abstractions ("profound silence," "ephemeral narrative," "unhurried intensity") and passive sentence structures drains momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose suffers from frequent clichés ("winds howled like a chorus," "spark of inspiration," "course through her veins") and weak verb choices. The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" is used repetitively and awkwardly, and the reliance on abstract nouns prevents the imagery from becoming vivid or tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with six paragraphs beginning with "As he [verb]..." or similar constructions. Clichés abound ("sea of twinkling lights," "heart quickened," "palpable energy"), and the text relies on telling rather than showing. There is little rhythmic variety or lexical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence patterning, particularly the "As [clause], [main clause]" construction used five times in quick succession. The text is dense with "purple" clichés and abstract adjectives ("immense," "otherworldly"), and the prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly as labels rather than integrated into the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive sentence scaffolding, with seven paragraphs opening with "As [noun/time]..." constructions. The text is dense with clichés ("twinkle like diamonds," "shroud," "bittersweet") and weak passive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is cluttered with unnecessary adjectives ("deliberate slowness," "earnestly naive") and cliché imagery ("kaleidoscope of pinks"). Phrasing is often awkward or nonsensical ("nexus of plausible impossibility") in an attempt to sound profound. Sentence structures are repetitive, creating a monotonous rhythm that drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=1.8)
    Severe repetition of specific phrases ("precisely humane touch," "sapphire-hued liqueur label," "spin stories," "expunge the pain") creates a robotic, looping effect. The prose lacks propulsion, circling back to restate previous points in nearly identical language, indicating a lack of editorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is functional but weighed down by clichés ("danced with colors," "ebb and flow," "spark that ignited") and repetitive imagery ("dance" describes the waterfall, starlings, land, and crystal). There are paraphrase loops where the narrative restates emotional connections without adding depth.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=2.8)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("watcher's burden," "trust," "reminder") creates a looping artifact that stalls momentum. The prose suffers from awkward adjectival stacking ("attentively inventive") and clichés ("reverberate through every cell").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("thick with tension," "course through his veins," "crucible") and abstract abstractions. Sentence structures are repetitive and passive, failing to generate rhythmic interest or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is overwritten and repetitive, relying on abstract nouns and "purple" descriptors ("hush of a possibility," "storm-born silence"). The word "flow" appears four times and "mystery" six times in a short space, creating a lexical loop. The recurrence of the specific phrase "storm-born silence" (twice) without recontextualization acts as a visible artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=2.2)
    A severe generation glitch occurs in the hourglass sentence ("after the final grain... after the final grain"), breaking the reading flow. The prose is repetitive ("true haunting" appears twice in close proximity) and heavily padded with modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with seven paragraphs opening or relying on an "As [noun] [verb]" construction ("As she walked," "As she waited," "As the mist"). This creates a droning, algorithmic rhythm. The writing is dense with clichés ("ethereal tentacles," "macabre grins") and purple phrasing that obscures rather than reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("Sisyphean task," "moment of truth," "fabric of reality") and mixed metaphors ("reeked of charred dreams"). Passive voice dominates crucial moments ("was gathered," "was done," "had emerged"), sapping momentum. The writing tells rather than shows, relying on abstract nouns instead of concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is saturated with abstract nouns ("vitality," "narrative," "resonance") and clichés ("veil of reality," "symphony") instead of concrete images. A pervasive template cadence (e.g., "As the moon...," "As she turned...," "As she listened...") deadens the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is overwritten with cliché modifiers ("ardent," "resiliently positive," "gentle thud") and vague metaphors ("symphony of sensation"). High density of abstract nouns and passive descriptions obscures the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key phrases ("sinew thread," "patterns") and a reliance on weak progressive verbs ("was using," "was searching") that drags momentum. The text is dense with "telling" constructions ("felt a sense of," "seemed to be"), and the overuse of "as if" similes creates a loop of hesitancy rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is ridden with clichés ("twinkled like diamonds," "velvet expanse," "beacon of hope") and repetitive vocabulary ("benthic" x4, "darkness" x5). The awkward modifier "balancedly curious" disrupts the flow immediately, and the reliance on abstract nouns prevents sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("tears streaming," "balm to her sorrow," "shroud," "veil") and abstract adjectives that dull the imagery. Sentence rhythm is repetitive and explanatory, often using "As [clause], [main clause]" structures that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("stood like a monolith," "testament to the passage of time," "mind racing") and oxymoronic phrasing ("crashing hush") that confuses rather than evokes. Sentence structure is repetitive, and "telling" overrides "showing" throughout the piece. Physics amnesia occurs at the end, ignoring the physical toll of rapid pressure changes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with a high frequency of sentences opening with "As..." or "With..." (template cadence). A likely usage error ("poured over the ink" instead of "pored over") undermines credibility, and keyword repetition ("midnight solace") feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("quietly articulate," "harness," "whispers," "patterns") creates a looping, stagnant rhythm. Abstract diction crowds out concrete action, and the text loops on the same concepts without deepening them.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of the construction "Lena felt a sense of [X]" (appearing ~8 times), creating a rhythmic drone and distancing the reader. Clichés abound ("shiver run down her spine," "see right through her," "unravel the tangled threads," "face them head-on"), and abstract nouns replace concrete imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("flowed like a river," "fresh eyes," "golden glow") and mixed metaphors ("scent of blossoming dreams"). Physical choreography is illogical; Luna plays the violin while explicitly "clutching" a shell in her hand, which defies the mechanics of the instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("seemed to" appears five times; "felt," "saw"), distancing the reader from the immediate sensory experience. Clichéd phrasing ("shrouded in shadows," "eyes fixed," "crescendo") and abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "peak of its fury") dilute the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with at least six sentences beginning with the "As [noun] [verb]..." structure (e.g., "As the carpenter worked," "As the sun rose"). This repetitive rhythm, combined with high cliche density ("spoke volumes," "crept over the horizon"), creates a monotonous and mechanical reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=2.9)
    The text suffers from significant repetitive phrasing ("soft, otherworldly light" appearing twice, "steadfast and alone" twice, "analog memories" four times) within a short word count. A glaring homophone error ("pouring over the tomes" instead of "poring") undermines the polished tone. Phrasing often falls into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose is saturated with purple abstractions and repetitive phrasing ("luminous absence," "vitalize the essence"), lacking sentence-level propulsion. Key terms are inserted awkwardly, and the reliance on summary prevents any density of information or action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is weighed down by abstract nouns ("significance," "resonance," "symphony") and cliché phrasing ("eyes... sharp with," "withered fingers"). Figurative language is dense but vague ("hush of cosmic possibility"), and the reliance on stock descriptions prevents the creation of vivid, specific imagery. The writing tells rather than shows, summarizing emotional states instead of evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=2.9)
    The text is saturated with clichés ("nook and cranny," "fabric of reality," "steeled herself," "looming like sentinels"). The specific phrase "crisp nostalgia" is repeated twice, indicating a lack of lexical control and reliance on "telling" rather than evoking.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.3)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a droning rhythm; six sentences begin with "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]" (e.g., "As they worked," "As the archivist studied," "As the hush deepened"). Cliché phrasings ("belied their nervous habit," "punctuated by," "thick with the scent") and filter stacks reduce immediacy and prose freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, with distinct phrases repeated verbatim ("succor the parched earth," "insatiably creative spirit," "radiant hush," "fabric of reality"). The density of clichés ("riot of color," "teeming with life") and abstract nouns obscures any concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers critically from repetition artifacts; "restorer" appears 13 times and specific phrases like "interlaced hush" and "accumulated silence" loop four to six times in a ~340-word text. This density of repetition creates a scaffolded, algorithmic feel that obscures any line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe repetitive sentence scaffolding; the construction "As she [verb]" appears seven times, creating a drone-like template cadence. Abstract nouns ("significance," "truth") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("shiver run down my spine," "method to my madness," "life of their own," "poignant reminder" used twice). Line-level logic is frequently flawed, most notably in the descriptions of dry, dusty books within a submerged environment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is severely marred by repetitive filtering artifacts, with the phrase "seemed to" appearing nine times and "began to" four times, creating a pervasive sense of uncertainty and distance. The text suffers from significant lexical redundancy ("mist/misty" x6, "courtyard" x7, "ghost in code" x5) and relies on abstract modifier strings ("gentle, ethereal breeze") instead of strong verbs. These issues strip the narrative of immediacy and density.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and weak verb constructions ("seemed to glow," "seemed a sanctuary"), lacking sentence-level propulsion. Repetitive adjectives ("soft, gentle") and the tense mismatch in the opening line mark significant craft lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose is saturated with clichés ("twinkling like diamonds," "secrets of the universe," "kaleidoscope," "heart swelled") that flatten the imagery. Sentences frequently follow a repetitive subject-verb structure that lacks rhythmic variety or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.6)
    The prose is weighed down by a high density of clichés ("shrouded in mystery," "relentless march towards progress," "rumbling to life") and adjective-noun pairings. Passive constructions and "telling" ("testament to the artist's unique skill") dilute the imagery and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.0)
    Severe syntactic repetition dulls the rhythm; seven sentences begin with "As [Subject]..." or similar dependent clauses (e.g., "As the antique airship," "As Eli turned," "As the starlings"). Description often lapses into generic summary ("strange creatures," "treasures") rather than specific, sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.0)
    Sentence structure is highly repetitive, with a distracting reliance on "As [clause]" constructions to open paragraphs (five instances). Phrasing is often clichéd ("intricate dance," "hidden harmonies") or logically strained ("uncap the delicate lock"). These artifacts create a template-like rhythm that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.7)
    While grammatically functional, the prose is entirely expository, relying on passive constructions and summary verbs ("had watched," "was a comforting one"). The text violates the "Show, Don't Tell" principle throughout, lacking sensory density or sentence-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts. The word "hush" appears 12 times, and the filter verb "seemed" appears 10 times in a very short text, creating a numbing, uncertain cadence. The writing relies heavily on abstract nouns (existence, time, beauty, power) and purple phrasing ("soothe the savage heart") rather than specific, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "former glory," "soft thud," "final flourish"). A typo ("an sudden surge") disrupts the reading experience. The writing relies on filter verbs ("feeling," "realized," "saw") and abstract summaries of action rather than concrete, immediate scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("soothing melody," "loosen its tight grip," "poignant reminder," "pieces began to fall into place"). A critical syntactic flaw exists: nearly every paragraph introduces action with a dependent "As..." clause, creating a distracting template cadence. Figurative language is mixed and standard ("music to her ears," "dawn of a new day" tone), failing to convey specific scientific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.0)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés ("piqued curiosity," "wash over her," "living, breathing entity") and tautological phrasing ("mind mindfully scattered"). The reliance on abstract nouns and adjective stuffing ("profound realization," "renewed determination") prevents the formation of sharp, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetition of specific phrases ("sandpaper rough memories" appears verbatim in the setup and resolution; "turmoil" and "remorse" are overused) creates a looping effect. The prose relies on clichés ("precision that belied the turmoil," "dance of the tides," "otherworldly light") that flatten the imagery. Sentence rhythm is monotonous, often following a simple Subject-Verb structure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("soothing as a summer breeze," "twinkled like diamonds," "velvet expanse") and purple abstraction. The writing relies on stock phrases and passive descriptions ("was a testament," "was a dance") that stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe repetitive syntax creates a monotonous rhythm; six sentences begin with "As [subject]..." (including the exact phrase "As the night wore on" twice), and many others follow a "The [noun] was..." pattern. The prose leans on purple abstractions ("quaking reverie," "aura of mystique") that obscure rather than clarify the action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose suffers from "adjective-itis" and awkward phrasing, most notably the oxymoronic "clandestinely luminous," which confuses rather than clarifies. The reliance on abstract nouns ("threshold effects," "phenomenon") creates distance, and the pacing is sluggish due to a lack of concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose is cluttered with scaffolding phrases ("began to," "aimed to") and passive constructions that sap momentum. Frequent use of filter verbs ("eyes narrowed," "seemed out of place") distances the reader from the action. The writing relies on cliché descriptors ("rich soil," "rough-hewn") and lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.4)
    Sentence structure is highly repetitive, with a persistent "As [event], [clause]" template cadence opening multiple paragraphs. The prose is weighed down by cliché strings ("thrill of victory and agony of defeat," "cusp of a great discovery") and adjective-heavy descriptions that reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.4)
    Prose is laden with "purple" abstractions ("weave disparate threads," "tapestry of understanding") and repetitive descriptors (the word "soft" appears four times). The reliance on repetitive sentence openers ("As she worked," "As the final stillness," "As she focused," "As she read") creates a droning, scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("blooming flowers," "deep wisdom," "fabric of reality") and awkward, bureaucratic phrasing like "began to journalize." The density of filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed," "she realized") and abstract descriptors flattens momentum and distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose is grammatically functional but suffers from low density and cliché ("ethereal fingers," "profound"). Paragraphs often summarize action ("navigating by water flow and instinct") rather than showing the specific mechanics of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.2)
    Prose is weighed down by clichés and repetitive sentence structures ("The investigator [verb]...", "She [verb]..."). Phrases like "singular convergence of steel and shadow" read as forced purple prose, and "hazy precision" appears as an inserted oxymoron rather than a textural quality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is overwritten with adjective-heavy description and abstract nouns ("translucent depths," "ethereal light") that reduce clarity and impact. The verbatim repetition of clunky prompt phrases ("certify wonder as essential," "oscillating repose") creates artificial loops that disrupt the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose suffers from heavy reliance on clichés ("gathering twilight," "stood sentinel," "beyond the veil") and awkward adjectival phrasing. A significant grammatical error disrupts the inciting action ("carefully uncase" instead of "uncased"). The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" reads as forced and unnatural, and the text relies on abstract "telling" over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("whirred to life," "feverish intensity," "palpable sense") and abstract noun piles ("swirling vortex of meaning," "kaleidoscope of emotions") that obscure the image. Frequent use of filter verbs ("Echo felt," "Echo saw") and "telling" summary prevents the scene from achieving high-resolution density or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe template cadence issues are present; seven sentences begin with "As [clause]..." or "And as...", creating a monotonous rhythm that deadens momentum. The prose is cluttered with clichés ("back of her hand," "spark of wonder," "veil between the worlds") and abstract metaphors that lack sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=2.7)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("As she stood," "As she studied," "As the mist") and reliance on empty intensifiers ("profound," "very heart"). The density of cliché phrasing ("world beyond the veil," "change her life forever") obscures any potential for sharp imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=2.9)
    Serious repetitive artifacting occurs with the phrase "Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry," which appears three times as a scaffold. The metaphor "stoically sparkling" is incoherent, and the prose relies heavily on abstract telling over concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("test of time," "blessing and a curse," "balm to my soul," "phoenix from the ashes"). Sentence structure is repetitive and scaffold-heavy, often relying on "As I [verb]..." constructions that dull the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers severely from template cadence; the construction "As she [verb]..." begins seven distinct paragraphs, creating a repetitive, droning rhythm. Phrasing relies on clichés ("ethereal light," "changed her forever") and tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("message in a bottle," "hint of dawn," "relentless pounding") and repetitive phrasing, with the specific phrase "luminescent ache" appearing four times in a short space. Sentences are often padded with weak adjectives and adverbs that dilute momentum ("unsettling silence," "familiar weight"). The rhythm is monotonous, lacking the variation needed to build tension or release it effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and a lack of rhythmic variety. There are basic proofreading errors ("an soft") and a reliance on filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt"). Phrase loops such as "slicing through" and "emerald lighthouse" reduce the text's density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is weighed down by oxymoronic clutter ("quietly explosive aroma") and stock phrasing ("moths to a flame," "economical and precise"). The writing lacks propulsion, relying on static description and abstract nouns rather than strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is weighed down by clichés ("slap," "machinery of the universe," "heart of the labyrinth") and repetitive sentence structures ("As they...", "The worker..."). Several scaffold phrases ("For in this world," "In this world") repeat uncomfortably, and the final paragraph relies on exhausted metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures, particularly "As she [verb]..." constructions, creating a monotonous rhythm. There is a high density of "purple prose" artifacts ("ethereal energy," "shimmering," "pulsing") and clichés ("beacon of hope," "shrouded in darkness"). The writing often summarizes effects rather than showing concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("whispered secret," "blended seamlessly," "untrained eye") and abstract telling. Sentence structures are repetitive, and the reliance on passive description drains momentum; the "method of staying while leaving" is defined rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose relies heavily on summary and abstract labels ("creeping normality noticer") rather than specific, active verbs. Repetitive sentence structures ("The noticer...", "The figure...", "As she...") create a monotone rhythm that drags the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntactic monotony: at least seven sentences begin with the "As [clause], [main clause]" structure ("As she carefully lifted...", "As she worked...", "As she departed..."). The prose is cluttered with abstract nouns ("essence," "oblivion," "fabric") that reduce clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("air was thick," "heart quickened," "palpable," "living, breathing thing") and purple abstractions. Sentence structures are repetitive, often following a "Statement, participle phrase" pattern. There is a high density of filter verbs and "mad-lib" style insertion of prompt phrases that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from significant reliance on clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "heart pounding with anticipation," "eyes fixed on the horizon") and repetitive sentence structures. Descriptions lean on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "spectral," "otherworldly") rather than concrete, sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is weighed down by clunky modifier stacks ("charcoal-fingered portrait sketch artist") and abstract telling ("rectify the creative blockage"). The reliance on clichés ("echo of laughter faded," "weight... lift," "jumbled mess") flattens the imagery and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("eked out a living," "shiver run down her spine") and filter verbs ("felt," "saw"). A repetitive "As she [verb]" template cadence appears frequently ("As she worked," "As she walked," "As she read"), flattening the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=1.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts; the phrase "symphonies of truth" appears six times, and "kinetic sculpture" six times in a short space. Syntactic variety is poor, with six paragraphs beginning with "As..." or similar temporal clauses, creating a drudging template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is marred by the repetitive use of abstract "glitch" phrases ("inner static," "fragmented wholeness") and scaffolded sentence structures ("As she [verb]..."). The density of telling over showing drains momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("air was alive," "discerning eye," "palpable," "get to the bottom of it") and relies heavily on "As [clause], [subject] [verb]" sentence structures. There is a high frequency of scaffold phrases ("Just then," "Slowly, a narrative began to emerge") that tell the reader what is happening instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose is severely marred by mechanical repetition, specifically the construction "sense of [abstract noun]" (kinship, purpose, familiarity, liberation, etc.), which appears over a dozen times. This pervasive artifact loop, combined with filter verb stacks, destroys momentum and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=2.6)
    The prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("dipped below the horizon," "soothing melody," "betrayed a sense," "fabric of space-time," "shrouded in mystery"). There is a high density of filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "saw") and template cadence that creates a sluggish, repetitive rhythm. The writing tells rather than shows at nearly every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=1.9)
    The prose is heavily repetitive, with phrases like "crane's origami wing," "gentle rustle," and "smooth the hush" looping multiple times without variation. Abstract descriptors and filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a sense of") dilute immediacy, and the density of "purple" adjectives suffocates the action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose is heavily laden with clichés ("intricate patterns," "twinkling lights," "flowing like a river," "shiver run down their spine," "hidden in plain sight"). Descriptions consistently "tell" rather than "show" (e.g., "wove a subtle magic"). The reliance on abstract modifiers ("mysterious," "magical," "ancient") prevents any sharp, vivid imagery from forming.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from high repetition ("velvet," "whispering seashell half") and a density of clichés ("tangled web," "beacon in the darkness"). The phrase "resonance structures" is a jarring register break, reading like a technical prompt insertion within a fantasy context. The reliance on abstract nouns over concrete verbs stalls momentum and creates a "telling" rather than "showing" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=1.5)
    Severe syntax looping makes the prose mechanical; 8 out of 10 paragraphs begin with the identical "As [subject]..." stem. Key phrases ("faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct") are repeated verbatim, indicating a total lack of line-level filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with a high frequency of sentences starting with "As [action]" or "In this [state]," creating a monotonous rhythm. "Purple" clichés abound ("haunting and beautiful," "cry of a lonely bird"), and the repetition of "reed-blown melancholy" and "serpentine" feels unintentional and clunky.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.0)
    Severe flaws include a grammatical breakdown in the opening sentence ("surrounded by... emitted") and unmotivated tense switching. The prose relies heavily on clichés ("eyes... like stars," "broken shell") and "telling" constructions ("was a symbol"), with repetitive phrasing ("ethereal," "surrounded by").

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetition artifacts present; "hidden patterns" and "lights flashing in a pattern" are repeated verbatim multiple times. Sentence structures loop heavily (repeated "As she..." openings), and filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive scaffolding; five paragraphs begin with or prominently feature the construction "As she [verb]" ("As she walked," "As she worked," "As she continued," "As the sun," "As she stood"). Filter verbs clutter nearly every beat ("she noticed," "she realized," "she felt," "she knew"). Clichés abound ("shiver run down her spine," "heart pounding," "sickly yellow glow"), flattening the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe "template cadence" artifacts appear, with nine sentences beginning with "As..." creating a monotonous rhythm. Frequent repetition of full noun phrases ("cobalt glass portico") and abstract diction results in low information density.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntactic repetition cripples the prose. Nearly every paragraph transition relies on the same "As [clause], [main clause]" structure ("As he sat up...", "As he wandered...", "As the music box...", "As the light...", "As the last notes..."). This template cadence creates a droning rhythm that flattens all urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=2.2)
    Severe reliance on template cadence; nearly half the paragraphs begin with "As [X]..." or "With [X]..." constructions. The prose suffers from high repetition of words ("creak," "ethereal," "vibration," "balance") and relies on purple, empty modifiers ("rich tapestry," "symphony of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition ("sense of purpose," "moment," "knew that") and relies on weak adverbs ("softly purposeful") and clichés ("dawn of a new era," "course of history"). Information density is low, with many sentences serving as scaffold for abstract internal summary.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetition loops damage flow; "reverberate" appears three times, "entangled/untangle" four times, and "watchfully calm" three times. The prose relies on scaffold structures ("As she...", "Maya felt...") and abstract nominalizations like "fortified vulnerability" that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of key phrases ("vibrant hush" x3, "apology into action" x3, "deserve a second chance" x3) which act as distracting text artifacts. The reliance on filter verbs ("he felt a sense of," "he realized") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose relies heavily on clichés ("nook and cranny," "whirred to life") and filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "sensed") instead of concrete imagery. Repetitive sentence stems ("As she...", "With...") create a monotonous rhythm that lacks propulsion and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is functional but laden with clichés ("swept under the rug," "shiver run down her spine," "new light") and passive constructions. The reliance on summary language ("The journey was taking her...") robs the narrative of immediacy and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures (noun-brick "The peacekeeper [verb]" constructions) and forced inclusion of prompt phrases that disrupt the rhythm. "Weighted breath before reply" and "map empathy onto action" feel like awkward insertions rather than organic parts of the sentence. The density of abstract modifiers weakens the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, specifically the "I felt a sense of [abstract noun]" construction, which appears nearly ten times (detachment, surrender, peace, purpose, fold in patience, solace, etc.). Additionally, the phrase "a reminder of/that" is overused to force significance onto objects. These tics create a monotonous rhythm and abstract the experience entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is heavily overwritten ("passionate subtlety," "whispers of the autumn wind") and relies on "telling" over "showing." Severe artifacting is present: the phrase "destined mismatches" appears four times, and "intersubjective understanding" twice, creating a repetitive, template-like cadence that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=1.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive artifacts, specifically the "sense of [noun]" construction used nine times ("sense of stillness," "sense of responsibility," "sense of pride," etc.). "Echo of wisdom" appears seven times. These loops and the heavy reliance on filter verbs flatten the text and destroy density.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.9)
    Severe prose artifacts undermine the reading experience; "dove gray map case" appears five times and "rusted factory ruins" four times in a short space. The text relies on telling ("sense of peace," "sense of serenity") instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("red-rimmed," "staccato rhythm," "cloaked in shadows") and mixed metaphors ("hush that seemed to reverberate"). Synonym churn is frequent (silence/hush/stillness), and the reliance on adjective-noun pairs stifles narrative momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from severe template cadence, with seven paragraphs beginning with the "As [clause], [main clause]" structure. The text is dense with clichés ("palpable entity," "veil of fog," "ebb and flow," "living, breathing entity"), and the rhythm is monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("beacon of hope," "world gone mad," "former glory," "wonder and awe") and passive constructions. Sentences frequently follow a repetitive subject-verb pattern that lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from repetitive sentence structures and frequent use of "seemed to" (5 times) and "began to" (4 times). Phrasing like "decisively kind" is awkward, and abstract nouns replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("sands of time," "fabric of the world," "hub of activity," "twinkled like diamonds," "scratched the surface") that dull the imagery. Filter verbs ("she thought she saw," "Lyra knew," "Lyra felt") distance the reader from the action. An awkward grammatical artifact appears in the insertion of the prompt phrase ("method of by closing loops").

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=1.8)
    Prose is severely repetitive, utilizing the construction "sense of [noun]" over ten times and relying on sentence stems like "As she [verb]." Clichés ("shaken to her core," "cusp of something groundbreaking") dominate the descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=1.9)
    Severe repetition of key phrases ("star watcher" appears ~14 times; "pearl of stillness" ~5 times) and reliance on "As [clause]" scaffolding creates a drudging rhythm. Redundancies like "soft zephyr, a gentle breeze" and purple prose further degrade line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.4)
    Prose is repetitive and laden with abstract adjectives ("serene," "soothing," "gentle"). Required phrases are pasted in verbatim ("honeyed hush," "quietly proactive") without blending into the sentence rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is riddled with repetitive sentence structures (eight sentences begin with "As she...") and overuse of filter verbs. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery ("sense of peace," "essence of the human experience"), and the text is clogged with "purple" clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.6)
    Severe syntactic repetition creates a monotonous rhythm, with at least seven sentences beginning with "As..." or a similar temporal clause. The prose is dense with clichés ("tapestry of sound," "golden stories," "hush that seemed to draw") and lacks concrete, active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.9)
    The prose relies heavily on abstraction ("essence," "otherworldly," "power") and cliché ("world was holding its breath," used twice). There is little sentence-level propulsion, with passive constructions and generic "noun-of-noun" phrasing bogging down the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.4)
    Significant prose artifacts mar the text, including a direct repetition loop ("whirred to life, its mechanisms whirring") and a stack of filter verbs in the closure beat. The diction leans on clichés ("steady heartbeat," "fabric of time") and repetitive sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive phrasing (multiple sentences beginning with "As the..." or "With...") and lexicon loops ("testament to" appears three times). The reliance on purple prose ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") feels forced, and the density of adjectives suffocates the action. The rhythm is monotonous and lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("palpable weight," "swirling emotions," "rolling boil," "wafting up") and abstract phrasing. Repetitive sentence structures and "tell-y" summaries ("something tangible and meaningful") prevent engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe repetitive artifacts lower the quality; entire phrases ("negotiate with their own ghost," "eroded ambitions," "testament to the enduring power") are repeated verbatim. The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns and adjective stacking ("practiced air," "tangible connection"), reducing clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    A severe structural artifact damages the prose rhythm: eight sentences/paragraphs begin with the identical "As [clause]" construction ("As the last wisps...", "As she walked...", "As she worked...", etc.). The text is dense with clichés ("testament to," "beacon of possibility") and lacks concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is severely marred by the verbatim repetition of complex, nonsensical phrases ("petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush") across multiple paragraphs. These repetitive loops read like forced keyword insertions and destroy the rhythmic flow and immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is marred by the forced repetition of awkward prompt phrases ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") that disrupt the rhythm. A high density of filter verbs and abstract descriptors ("ethereal light," "profound truth") results in a sluggish, passive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of sentence structures (numerous sentences begin with "As she..." or "The collector..."). There is a high density of filter verbs and abstract noun phrases ("sense of peace," "sense of excitement," "sense of gratitude") that distance the reader from the action. The writing is scaffold-heavy and lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetitive looping (the phrase "palace carpet weft thread still clutched in my hand" appears three times almost verbatim) and adjective clutter ("mournful sigh," "unsettling stillness"). The recurring meta-description "vivid, descriptive" (used three times) is a distraction that highlights the lack of actual descriptive specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from severe syntactic repetition, with six sentences beginning with &quot;As [subject] [verb]...&quot; constructions, creating a monotonous drone. The text is dense with clichés (&quot;shards of stone,&quot; &quot;symbol of hope,&quot; &quot;sleeping giant&quot;) and lacks concrete, sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is riddled with clichés ("heart sink," "sprang into action," "found her true calling") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew"). Repetitive sentence structures and awkward modifiers ("gracefully alert") dampen the rhythm and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is grammatically functional but cluttered with weak modifiers and "synonym churn" that slows momentum. There is a reliance on telling over showing, with abstract summaries of action ("employed a method she had honed") replacing concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.6)
    Prose is repetitive, with five paragraphs beginning with "As [pronoun/noun] [verb]" constructions. The writing relies on purple prose and abstract modifiers ("otherworldly energy," "troubling serenity") instead of strong verbs and specific nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.1)
    Severe syntactic monotony undermines the prose, with seven sentences beginning with the identical "As [clause]" structure. The writing is laden with oxymoronic clichés ("thundering calm," "serene gloom") and abstract nouns that dilute the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.3)
    The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("dark sentinel," "time... held its breath," "flooding back," "into the light"). Sentence structures are repetitive, and the reliance on abstract nouns (redemption, balance, turmoil) prevents the formation of concrete, visceral imagery. The "searing reverie" is told rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is saturated with adverbs ("tenderly," "precisely," "meticulously," "slowly") and filter verbs ("began to discern," "began to sense"). Syntactic repetition is severe, with five paragraphs opening with "As [event]..." or "After [event]...", creating a monotonous, droning rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=2.8)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("groundedly imaginative" used three times as a clumsy modifier) and abstract nouns. The density of "tell" statements and lack of concrete imagery result in a sluggish, essayistic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.1)
    Severe repetitive artifacts, including the phrase "thistled calm" (3x) and "mist" (7x), destroy prose rhythm. Basic errors ("an presence") and logical contradictions (a "secretly luminous" dial that casts "ethereal light") indicate a lack of editorial standard.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=2.5)
    A glaring grammatical error ("seems to weaves truth") undermines credibility. The prose relies heavily on filter verbs ("Lena finds herself," "Lena notices") and repetitive phrasing ("sense of," "mirage of safety" x3). Vocabulary is abstract and repetitive ("essence" x3), lacking the concrete density required for high-quality fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=2.9)
    The prose suffers from high cliché density ("thick with the stench," "brought the world to its knees," "tangled web") and repetitive sentence structures (subject-verb openings like "Kael's eyes gleamed," "Kael turned," "Kael saw"). This "template cadence" creates a monotonous rhythm that drags momentum. The reliance on filter verbs ("Kael saw," "Kael's thoughts") further distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.6)
    Sentence structure is highly repetitive and monotonous, with a severe reliance on "As [clause], [main clause]" openers (6+ instances) and "And so" transitions. The prose is cluttered with filter verbs ("felt a pang," "felt the weight," "seemed to denote") and passive constructions that distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("testament to forgotten dreams," "dance on her palate") and purple descriptors ("ethereal," "symphony"). The misuse of "synaptic plasticity" (a neural mechanism) to describe plant growth creates a jarring logical break.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from low information density and frequent clichés ("dipped below the horizon," "air was alive," "beauty in unexpected places"). Sentence structure is repetitive and relies on passive summary rather than concrete, active imagery, preventing any rhythmic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.1)
    Prose is bloated with adjective-noun pairings and suffers from awkward phrasing forced by prompt insertion ("inadvertently profound presence"). Syntactic issues, such as the dangling personification of streetlights, further degrade clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.0)
    A severe syntactic template loop ("As the [noun] [verb]...") dominates the sentence openings, creating a droning rhythm. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery, and prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly ("animate lifeless tone" is nonsensical in context).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=2.6)
    Prose is heavily burdened by clichés ("glimmer of hope," "rabbit hole," "fabric of reality," "slipped through my fingers") and repetitive syntax. The "As I [verb]" sentence opener is used four times, creating a droning rhythm that kills momentum. Almost every sentence tells rather than shows ("It was a rupture," "I was a grim optimist").

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is laden with clichés ("swallow the stars," "labor of love") and repetitive "adjective-noun" constructions that dull the rhythm. The phrase "saffron quiet" and the term "lost languages" are repeated as loops without accumulating new meaning or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=2.4)
    Severe repetitive sentence structure destroys the rhythm; seven paragraphs begin with the identical construction "As [clause]..." ("As the last wisps...", "As they walked...", "As they watched..."). This mechanical template cadence renders the prose monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=2.5)
    The prose is marred by verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("under the slow exhale of low tide," "neatly inventive mind") and clunky descriptors. Logic breaks occur at the line level (the sudden candle). The text relies heavily on "felt" and "knew" constructions, and the pacing is flattened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=1.9)
    A severe repetitive loop ("The whispering advisor's voice...") begins nearly every paragraph, creating a distracting mechanical cadence. Cliché density is critically high ("wisps of fog," "gentle breeze," "loomed," "beckoning"), and the prose lacks density or fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("wispy tendrils," "held breath," "vast expanse") and abstract nouns that obscure specific imagery. Heavy use of filter verbs ("she saw," "she began to") and telling ("testament to," "rooted in") drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=3.5)
    Significant repetitive phrasing and lexical loops severely hamper the prose (e.g., "sense of unease," "sense of dread," "sense of defiance"; "driven by the need... quietly driven... driven by her quietly driven nature"). Pervasive use of filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "Lyra knew") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=2.8)
    Prose suffers from high cliché density ("skeletal fingers," "ghostly figure") and syntactic monotony, with many sentences following a repetitive Subject-Verb structure. Pivotal moments of discovery and analysis are summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("bygone era," "stories untold," "message in a bottle," "beacon in the void") and repetitive sentence structures. Specific phrases like "hushed blaze," "interlaced absence," and "stoically sensitive" are repeated verbatim as static tags, disrupting rhythm and indicating a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe template cadence dominates the prose. Nearly every paragraph begins with "As [clause]..." or "With [noun phrase]..." (e.g., "As the last...", "With each new...", "As she continued...", "With the ink stamp..."). This repetitive syntactic structure creates a monotonous rhythm that deadens the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=2.6)
    The text suffers from severe repetitive loops, using the phrases "luminous torment" (3x), "shaping and molding" (2x), and "transforming sorrow/grief" (3x) in a short space. Additionally, grammar is strained by forced prompt insertion ("feeling of descends while ascending"), and the prose is dense with clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=1.7)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("fraught with danger," "never be the same again," "cusp of something momentous"). The phrase "intangibly tangible" is a jarring contradiction that confuses rather than illuminates. Sentence structure is repetitive, often starting with participial phrases or simple subject-verb constructions that plod along without momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.7)
    The prose suffers from a repetitive template cadence, with seven sentences beginning with "As [subject] [verb]..." (e.g., "As the pilgrim arrived," "As she scanned," "As she worked"). High density of clichés ("twinkle like diamonds") and mixed metaphors ("scent of... forgotten knowledge") weakens the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is severely repetitive, relying on a "template cadence" of dependent clauses starting with "As" (used 6+ times: "As a genealogist," "As she searched," "As she did," "As the sun dipped," etc.). This creates a droning rhythm that kills momentum. Figurative language is often mixed or cliché ("skeletal fingers," "gleam in the fading light"), and the text is padded with unnecessary adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)
    Severe syntactic repetition mars the rhythm; six paragraphs begin with "As..." constructions ("As the moon," "As she stood," "As the talks"), creating a droning, template-like cadence. Clichéd phrasing ("storm-worn windblown," "living entity") and adjective pile-ups further weaken the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=2.5)
    Prose is ridden with clichés ("wash over him," "candle flame in the wind," "bright future"). The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("backlash of regrets," "align heart and actions") multiple times creates a mechanical, scaffolded rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose suffers from high modifier density and cliché ("creaking wooden dock," "mist-shrouded," "clean slate"). There are significant artifacts of "telling," such as the line explaining the labyrinth metaphor directly to the reader. Phrasing like "delicately robust" reads as a forced prompt insertion that contradicts itself.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose is heavily reliant on clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "tears streaming," "exhilarating and terrifying") and abstract nouns. The reliance on filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "Lyra knew") and summary sentences drains the narrative of immediacy and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=2.4)
    The phrase "sense of" appears five times in this short text, creating a repetitive scaffold that dilutes emotional impact. Abstract phrasing ("choking beauty," "fractures in time") replaces concrete imagery, and the density of filter verbs stalls narrative momentum. The prose relies on telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)
    Prose is padded with weak adjective-noun pairings ("gentle ease," "quiet purpose," "soft, ethereal light") and standard clichés ("heart swelled," "twinkle in anticipation"). Information density is low, with many sentences restating the character's emotional state without advancing the story.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition loops; "whispering hush" appears seven times and "slow dance" three times in a short space, creating a numbing drumbeat rather than rhythm. The text is dense with filter verbs ("Aria felt," "Aria knew") and abstract nouns ("vibrancy," "transformation") that obscure concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose suffers from severe repetition of key phrases ("cradle of sparks" appears seven times; "freedom and creativity" three times; "sense of purpose and belonging" twice). Clichés like "spread like wildfire" and "inky darkness" further dilute the line-level quality.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.0)
    Significant repetitive phrasing damages the prose quality; "precognitively cursed nature stirred" appears three times, and "sacred patterns" and "collapsed star dust" are overused to the point of semantic satiation. The writing relies on "tell" structures ("a substance rumored to hold," "herder had been told") and stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "symphony of pattern").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=2.6)
    Prose is dense with clichés ("chorus of the damned," "eye of the hurricane," "threads of a tapestry") and abstract nouns. Sentence structures are repetitive and lack rhythmic variety. The phrase "cartography of scars" is repeated three times in a short space, reading as a loop artifact rather than a resonant motif.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=2.5)
    Severe syntax repetition creates a distracting template cadence; eight distinct paragraphs begin with the construction "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]..." (e.g., "As he waited," "As he fenced," "As the duel reached"). Clichés abound ("danced across the floor," "palpable force," "spirit unbroken").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.0)
    The prose is riddled with clichés ("phoenix from the ashes," "beacon of hope") and suffers from severe repetitive phrasing, specifically the construction "sense of [abstract noun]" which appears nine times (purpose, possibility, excitement, pride, accomplishment, hope, gratitude). Filter verbs ("eyes shone," "thoughts turned") distance the reader from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.4)
    The prose is saturated with clichés ("fingers dancing across the keys," "time had stood still," "poured her heart and soul," "fireflies on a summer's night"). Sentence structures are repetitive and declarative, often following a "The [noun] was a [adjective] [noun]" pattern that kills momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.4)
    The prose is dense with clichés ("lifeblood of her community," "grains of sand," "treasure trove," "tapestry of vibrant colors"). Sentence structures are repetitive and passive, often relying on "As [time passed/she worked]..." constructions to bridge gaps in the narrative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.2)
    The prose suffers from severe artifact looping, repeating the exact phrases "rhythmically placid atmosphere" (3x), "tides of remembrance" (5x), and "cerulean regret" (3x) to the point of absurdity. Sentence structure is highly repetitive ("He [verb]..."), creating a robotic template cadence. These mechanical insertions and scaffolded sentences destroy narrative momentum and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Some paraphrase loops in emotion descriptors ("sense of peace... balm... catalyst") and repetitive vibration imagery dull density in collaboration beat; strong propulsion otherwise with varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetitive paraphrase loops on "stillness," "peace," and "permanent address" (e.g., multiple "sense of peace" variants) create synonym churn dulling propulsion; template cadence in reflective beats like "as he pondered" runs; density suffers in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    Paraphrase loops restate unity/pride ("sense of pride," "quiet confidence," "heart full of hope") across paragraphs; repetitive soft/gentle stems create template cadence, dulling propulsion in speech peak.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Poetic rhythm varies purposefully, but "felt a deep sense" paraphrase loop across emotional beats dulls density slightly; no closure harm.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.3)
    Heavy overwriting with figurative density in peak beats ("dissolving into a quaking reverie," "rhythm of the universe"); mixed metaphors strain coherence. Paraphrase loops restate awe ("disorienting, yet exhilarating" echoes "exhilarating and terrifying"). Template cadence in sequential perceptions dulls propulsion through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paraphrase loops in closing ("reminder," "testament," legacy restatements) and template cadence ("The liberator...") across multiple sentences dull propulsion; synonym churn on purpose/impact pervades final third.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., forge whispers counterpoint colors); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops in "sound of trust breaking" repeats and memory drifts dull propulsion slightly; no heavy artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "thrill of the unknown" and "promise of discovery" variations in final third) plus stacked purple modifiers (e.g., "soft, ethereal light") dull propulsion and obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.4)
    Paraphrase loops ("visionary knew... realized... felt") and template cadence ("As [time], the visionary...") across middle; repetitive motifs like "unfold" and "new dawn" create redundancy dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetitive emotional paraphrases ("felt a sense of" x4+) and synonym loops on purpose/redemption create scaffold drag; template cadence in reflective beats dulls density. Overwriting with stacked metaphors violates logic at times (e.g., light as "lover" amid decay). Propulsion weakens in summary blocks, but grammar clean.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (vibrate/resonate/hum, creak repeated 5x) dull momentum across descriptive runs, obscuring cause/effect in alignment process. Template cadence in stacked sensory sentences ("sound of... seemed to..."). Figurative overuse in every peak beat without pattern payoff triggers −1.2; artifacts touch closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)

    Paraphrase loops in ending ("potential for harmony/redemption/second chances") and repeated "vibrant hush"/heart motifs create redundancy; template cadence in reflections dulls propulsion; density solid otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops ("acid sea churned," "evolution," "irreverent awe" repeated across sentences); template cadence in descriptive runs dulls propulsion; low density with redundant restatements obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Paraphrase loops ("began to notice," "Lena's obsession grew," repeated "mystery/secrets") and template cadence in search beats dull density; artifacts cluster in reflective runs without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Some paraphrase loops ("peacekeeper's" repetition, glinting synonyms) and minor overwriting in stacked facets images dull density in reconstitution beat; rhythm varies read-aloud but template cadence in reflective phrases drags propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Varied rhythm propels accumulative density; purposeful hush/crystal repetition builds without obscuring closure; high info density weaves sensory action seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paraphrase loops in ending ("found what searching for," peace repetitions) dull closure image by −0.8; fog "swirled" x3 creates template cadence; rhythm varies but overwriting metaphors (ethereal fingers) reduce density in peak; high info density otherwise propels.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.0)
    Paraphrase loops abound, e.g., repeated "reminder" phrasing for clock hand across multiple sentences dulls propulsion. Template cadence in reflective beats ("He realized," "The [element] was a reminder"); overwriting with stock metaphors in peak tremors. Low density hampers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)

    Heavy paraphrase loops ("whispering advisor's voice" x12, lingering/beckoning refrains) and synonym churn (shudder/shiver/dread) dull propulsion, especially in mirror beat; template cadence in sequential "As I [action]" runs triggers -1.2. Closure image muddied slightly by redundancy, capping high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "reminder of the magic," music "resonating"/"echo"/"whisper" in final third) and synonym churn dull closure image; template cadence in descriptive runs ("seemed to" x5+). Overwriting with metaphors every sentence obscures propulsion; artifacts touch ending.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    Paraphrase loops in epiphanies ("felt an inexplicable connection... felt the weight... felt a sense"); template "As she [action], she felt" cadence across walks dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    High density with multi-job lines (e.g., spices integrate sensory/causal); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor loops in "felt" sensations (-0.3) and "paradoxically steady" motif paraphrase, but not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or artifacts in peak.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("sense of" x4, repetitive pondering of connections) and synonym churn (fractures/cracks/mirrors) dull density in reflective beats; rhythmic variety holds read-aloud but elevated diction borders purple in peak realization without obscuring CR closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Paraphrase loops ("felt the weight... settling upon her" twice; "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" exact repeat) and "As she" template stems dull mid-section density; figurative density overwrites without peak restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive stems ("Aria felt," "whispering hush" 5+ times) and paraphrase loops in epiphanies (e.g., "universe was orchestrating... complex web of connections") create template cadence across final third, dulling closure image (−1.2 artifacts). Low density; redundant telling summarizes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    Heavy paraphrase loops ("silent revolution," "new era," "infused with... purpose" x4+ in finale) and template cadence ("as the sentinel... she knew") dull closure image; overwriting with stacked modifiers obscures propulsion in peak reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clean grammar, clear pronouns, no typos; read-aloud rhythm is pleasant but syntactic templates recur (“As she…”, “Maria’s thoughts turned…”) without purposeful pattern, creating low-level scaffold. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate—some sentences could compress without loss. No artifact touches closure, but neither does any sentence achieve memorable compression or sonic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Metaphor-rich cadence risks purple overload (“inky shadows,” “drifting resonance”) yet sustains coherent texture. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary openings. One paraphrase loop: “she felt a sense of…” x3. Closure image stays clear. Slight register lift in final paragraph keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric rhythm supports accumulative mode without algorithmic pattern; sentences vary in length and breath. No loops or synonym churn; “vibrations emanating from it like ripples on a pond” is lone stock image but does not touch closure. High information density—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data—and no scaffold bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, with strong sensory specificity and only minor scaffold (“the undertaker… the undertaker…” openings twice). No metaphor muddle or synonym loops; one paraphrase loop (“the stillness he had long sought… the stillness he had been chasing”) mildly dulls momentum but does not touch the closure image.</question>
    
    <question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Submerged-library-as-beacon is a fresh synthesis of gothic and solarpunk-quiet, elevated by the undertaker’s vocational inversion from burial to safekeeping. The concept commits fully; risk lies in the quiet ending, but it pays off by reweighting the signal’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or mixed metaphor, but leans on abstract feel-good phrasing (“spirit of solidarity,” “beacon of hope”) that blunts specificity. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no density spike or breath variation. Functional, not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rhythm swells and subsides with the breathing cycle, avoiding template cadence. Some figurative stacking (“blossoms seemed to unfurl like tiny stars…ethereal dancers”) drifts toward purple in the peak beat; -0.4 for density without pattern payoff. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; props (pendant, camera) are handled cleanly. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge the luminous-wisteria motif effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush yet efficient: each sentence layers image or concept without paraphrase loops. Metaphors remain coherent—“fabric of reality was being rewoven” extends the textile motif already latent in “texture of time.” Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“navigated,” “grasp,” “dissolving”) propel momentum. A few soft adjectives (“otherworldly energy,” “inexplicable connection”) could be traded for sharper nouns, but artifacts do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, but paraphrase loops appear: “seeds of change,” “seeds of the future,” “seeds that could thrive” within three sentences. Metaphors are serviceable yet familiar—tumbling wall, beacon of hope. Information density drops in the vault passage where sentences list rather than layer. Errors are minimal, but momentum sags each time the prose repeats thematic noun phrases instead of advancing tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Information density high: each sentence layers sensory data, emotional charge, and world detail (“ashen forge… aurora-lit sky” does triple duty). Metaphors stay coherent—glass-shatter sound never collides with orchard imagery. Only micro-slip: “tinkered with her latest hearing aid prototype” carries mild expositional throat-clearing, but it’s swallowed by immediate sensory plunge. No artifact touches closure; final line’s “joyful cacophony” lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence rhythm is fluid but leans on participial openers and soft stacked modifiers (“bathed in the soft, ethereal light”). No loops or synonym churn; clarity intact. High density early slows mid-story; momentum recovers in final paragraph. Metaphors stay coherent within light motif; no strained vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    Texture is dense but loops appear: four “as the” openers in 70 words; “thawing heart” echoed three times without re-weighting. Mixed metaphor shroud/damp/perfume is coherent. No scaffold sentences or filter-verb stacks; clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor redundancy keeps it from 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and readable, but sentences often open with participial or “as I…” scaffolding that postpones the main clause, softening punch. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“I felt a sense of purpose… I felt a shiver”) could be compressed. Figurative language is safe—stars as “reminder of vastness”—without risking fresh image. No artifact obscures causality, yet density is mid-level; many lines do only one job.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative layering is dense yet coherent under the accumulative lens; occasional adjective stacks (“storm-tossed ridge fort creaked and groaned”) are purposeful rather than purple; zero paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; final line lands with rhythmic snap.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly dense; occasional soft fillers (“a sense of resolve wash over her”) could be trimmed. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Register stays elevated but coherent with tone. Final lens image lands with clarity, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush yet mostly purposeful; however, strings of near-synonyms (“a testament… a reflection… a tribute…”) create paraphrase loops that dull the final third, and “withering beauty” is used twice within four lines, blunting the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, with varied sentence shapes and read-aloud rhythm. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job (“She smiled to herself…”). Mixed metaphors (“icy warmth,” “liquid fire”) are sanctioned by the prompt but still verge on cliché. No loops or paraphrase stacks; minor scaffold in the repeated “she felt” constructions keeps this just above artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong sensory specificity, but repeated scaffolding (“As…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“music of La Bohème swelled… / music… etched in heart”) gum rhythm. Figurative layering stays purposeful—water as score—without muddling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong information density: one sentence can layer weather, body, and epistemic breach. Rhythm modulates with pressure—no template cadence. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she knew”) appear but never in peak beats. Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line is crisp, letting mist perform closure work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean, varied sentence openers, strong sensory nouns. Occasional flourish density (“morbid perfume,” “staccato beat”) but never clouds causality. No loops or paraphrase stacks; no mixed metaphors. One soft scaffold: “they felt a sense… wash over them” used twice; mild, doesn’t touch closure. Prose is publish-ready at line level.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor vehicles stay internally coherent. Recurrent noun-phrase opener (“the chronicle keeper…”) creates mild syntactic monotony across paragraphs, not sentences, so template penalty is light. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; information density is high. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, low-scaffold; occasional adjective strings (“warm, golden light”) are earned by mood. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density modest—some sentences do only one job. Closure image clean; no artifacts touch final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long sentences for archival awe, shorter pulses for discovery. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“fabric…alive”). One paraphrase loop: “stories that walls had heard” repeated with slight variation; no clarity harm. No scaffold, no synonym churn. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the dust/whisper motif.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    Paraphrase loops every paragraph—“mysterious lighthouse… secrets and whispers… mysterious stranger… mysterious lighthouse.” Metaphors contradict: beam both “slices” and “drips.” Template cadence: every sentence opens abstract noun + passive verb + prepositional phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, with purposeful repetition that teaches its pattern early. A few soft adjective stacks (“haunting and beautiful,” “fragile and powerful”) slightly dilute peak beats. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Read-aloud rhythm is good, paragraphs breathe. One paraphrase loop (“the silence…a silence”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush yet generally precise; mixed metaphors are avoided and figurative language is patterned (mirror, glass, symphony) rather than random. Occasional uplift—“chronologically homesick aura,” “upturned hush”—leans decorative, but density never stalls momentum. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are clean. Final third is free of artifacts, so 9+ eligibility remains intact for other categories.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—light/dark, drop/ripple, path/labyrinth—each pair recurs with payoff, avoiding the "stacked metaphor" penalty. Scaffolding minimal: one paraphrase loop ("stood...stood...stood") in finale, but it serves incantatory closure rather than slack. Information density high; clauses carry double duty (action + metaphor) without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lovely individual phrases, but scaffold loops (“the cavern was…”) and stacked abstract nouns (“sense of wonder,” “filament of hush”) dilute momentum; a tighter cut would sharpen the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean but leans on abstraction (“layered tranquility,” “sinister presence”) where sensory specificity already did the work. Three near-repeats of “storm recorder” in opening 120 words create template cadence; “quiet courtyard” phrase recurs four times without pattern payoff. Metaphors are safe (“shroud,” “melted away”) and occasionally mixed (“words danced” vs. “hinting at a sinister presence”). No line-level artifact obscures causality, yet density is mid-range at best.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language clusters around scent and light, never breaking physical logic. Minor scaffold: “washes over her” appears twice; proximity paraphrase but not in closure beat. Density is high; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information. Read-aloud rhythm supports the incense-like cadence without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical and generally clean, but recurrent anaphora (“As she…”) and abstract nouns (“possibility,” “wonder”) create minor loop-drag. Metaphors are coherent yet cumulate toward purple in the final third (“canvas waiting to be filled with the patterns of human creativity”). No scaffolding obscures causality; clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense, image-driven, almost every sentence layered (sound + emotion + metaphor). No loops, paraphrase, or template cadence detected. Mixed-metaphor risk in “chronic hush that seemed to suffocate all sound” is saved by POV’s acoustic lens, so −0.2 only. One near-simultaneity glitch: “As she walked, the trees grew twisted” implies causality rather than sequence, but clarity survives. Closure beat is clean, figurative muddle absent, keeping the 8-band intact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, or texture without scaffold. Metaphors (“honey-like light,” “tapestry of feeling”) stay coherent within the perfumery frame. No loops or near-duplicates; paragraph cuts are clean. Minor overwriting in the dusk-deepening sequence—three consecutive image-sentences—barely dulls the final line. Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, ending on a hushed down-beat that satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, middle-register, with only occasional scaffold (“as they continued talking”) and no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm is steady, not propulsive; several openings repeat “As…,” creating a template cadence that dulls urgency. Information density is moderate—one job per sentence—never achieving high compression yet never clogging.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, with high information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in the mid-section (“luminescent ache… webs of kinship… glimmering obsidian”) risks purple, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so the artifact is allowable. The final line lands with image, not explanation, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid, with vivid sensory nouns and strong verbs; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated phrasing—“fabric of time was sculpts time itself”—is grammatically jarring but fits experimental compression. Figurative language clusters in the spell paragraph yet serves accumulative texture, not clutter. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; final line lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical but disciplined: concrete nouns (“mosaic stepping stone,” “dripping stalactites”) outweigh modifiers. Rhythm breathes with scene—cavern hush invites longer sentences. Minor loop penalty: “gentle” trio and two “seemed to” filters dull immediacy (−0.3). No mixed metaphors or scaffold; final line lands clean. Within high-band tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is smooth, rhythmic, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the dweller’s smile deepened… the dweller’s hands moved”) repeats. Figurative language is restrained and coherent. High information density in object cataloguing; no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line-level craft is clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips; metaphor is disciplined, not purple. However, template cadence recycles "As..." sentence openers in six consecutive beats, dulling momentum. Information density is moderate; several sentences paraphrase the prior one ("storm season continued to rage...transformation it had sparked"). Paragraph breaks track emotional beats, yet the closing image reuses "linden leaf...reminder" phrasing from the opening, feeling looped rather than repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (“The rain had a way of revealing hidden patterns and exposing secrets”). No scaffolding loops or synonym churn. A single mixed metaphor (“fabric of reality…torn asunder” alongside “trail of anomalies”) is forgivable at closure distance. Otherwise clean, vivid, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but repetitive—three consecutive sentences open “As…,” creating template cadence (−0.4). Mixed metaphors (“bright darkness,” “woven fabric,” “eternal song”) coexist without contradiction, so coherence holds, but density borders on purple for a 700-word piece. Information per sentence is moderate; some lines merely perfume the prior beat. Closure line is clean, uncluttered, and memorable, sparing the ending from artifact drag.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean, readable, and occasionally vivid, but relies on stock phrasing (“sense of renewal,” “beacon of hope,” “brighter future”) that cushions rather than sharpens moments; several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea, creating micro-loops that dull momentum in a piece already short on dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and readable, with some pleasing cadence shifts; however, repeated template stems (“As she…”) across multiple sentences create a mild drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent (“mist swirled around her ankles like a chill”) but accumulate predictably, lessening impact. Information density is moderate; several sentences could be compressed without loss (“The air was heavy with an otherworldly silence” + “The air grew colder…” three sentences apart). No grammar or pronoun issues; spatial tracking holds.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Line craft is clean but leans on abstract nouns (“fabric of reality,” “topology of the mind”) that cushion rather than pierce. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same insight (“entangled memories… interconnected memories… hidden patterns”) creating micro-loops. Figurative language stays coherent—no mixed metaphors—but filters and qualifiers (“seemed to,” “felt as if”) dilute immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, generally loop-free; occasional ornamental overlap (“colors surrounding Kael deepened, and the air vibrated…”) but momentum holds. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Dense informational layering—each sentence advances image or concept. A few scaffold phrases (“with each passing moment”) could be trimmed. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and causal work—"sterile smell of formaldehyde and the faint scent of flowers." No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent ("ink pot…liquefy rigid thinking"). Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths mirror tension crests. Clean grammar; pronoun track never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet selective; each sentence layers sensory data without padding. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (hum as “ethereal glow,” forest “holding breath”). One paraphrase loop: “the stationer’s pencil danced…capturing the subtleties” immediately restates prior beat (−0.2). Otherwise high density, clean grammar, and read-aloud rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is lush but leans on abstraction (“universal riddle,” “essence of the observatory”). Paraphrase loops create slight drag (“whispers of the past grew louder… until she was surrounded by a cacophony”). Opening and closing lines reuse wind/sea vocabulary to pleasing circular effect. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; sentences vary in length and avoid loops. Minor scaffold: repeated “the perpetual carnival…”—three hits feel decorative. No mixed metaphor; information density good. One filter-verb cluster in “she knew would ultimately prevail” slightly dulls immediacy.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft-carnival + culture-shock absorber + graffiti-resistance fusion feels fresh; not a template plot. Specificity of the chip as both symbol and literal fragment grounds the concept. Could push flaw or risk further for higher originality, but synthesis is memorable and fully committed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variation, and selective detail. Density high: many sentences do double duty. Figurative language is frequent but patterned and coherent. Minor scaffold: “the stillness…a dawning hush” is reprised almost verbatim; also “beauty that could be found…” appears twice. Loops do not touch closure, so cap remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence music is deliberate—long breathless units mimic fog swirl, then shorten on the final tweak. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; “mist-coated” recurs but as deliberate motif. Metaphors stay coherent (light, water, vibration); no mixed vehicles. Two near-purple phrases (“heartbeat of industry”) survive because they land at closure where cadence trumps plainness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean and mostly free of scaffolding, but metaphor strings in high-attention beats (“stars twinkled like diamonds”) feel inherited rather than invented. Several near-simultaneous participle openers create minor simultaneity hiccups. Paragraphing breathes with scene beats; no loops stall momentum, yet diction never surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies, propelling the slow procession; figurative language is restrained and coherent. Occasional loftiness (“fabric of reality was being reshaped”) flirts with abstraction but never loops or contradicts itself. A few near-repetitive stems (“the tuner continued their work… the tuner resumed their work”) dull momentum slightly, keeping the prose just shy of immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    High density early—“crumbling stone, faint glow, salt and decay” triply load one line. Later, template cadence surfaces: repeated “as time runs short,” “temple’s whispers grew louder.” Mixed metaphor harmless but one strained stack (“crystal perfume vial suspended from her neck… touches memories… unsnarled threads”) slightly clogs climax. Strong ear overall; minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence music is melodic, yet paraphrase loops echo (“boy felt… boy felt… boy knew…”), thinning density. Some metaphor strata mix (specter + lattice + thread) without taught pattern, risking incoherence. Momentum breathes more than propels; scaffolding like “he began to notice” could be trimmed. Clean grammar and spatial tracking keep clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Occasional template cadence (“the alchemist felt…”) and abstract clusters (“sense of longing,” “sense of gratitude”) create mild scaffold; metaphor engine runs smooth but leans on stock Gothic perfume (“sandalwood and myrrh”). Density is good; loops are cosmetic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Information density is moderate—some sentences perform only atmospheric work. Figurative language is frequent (“needle dancing,” “fabric of solace”) but patterned, not muddled. No loops or scaffold; occasional adjective stacks (“centuries-old labyrinth carved into the red canyon walls”) slightly dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openers vary, paragraphs breathe. Two adjacent “as she worked” sentences create a light paraphrase loop (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or purple clusters; however, repeated “sense of… growing within her” template dulls final third, preventing 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    Loop/Scaffold Screen: five near-repetitions of “golden arcade,” “surface mail,” “meaning in the margins” within 800 w; paraphrase churn dulls momentum. Metaphors are coherent but generic (“message in a bottle,” “golden arcade” as beacon) without texture payoff. Register drifts into promotional lyric in final third; density drops as summary replaces scene. Artifacts cluster in closure-adjacent sentences, barring 9+ and capping high-band at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to,” “as if”—dull immediacy in peak beats. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors, but density dips when shimmer is repeated without new sensory angle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: no loops, clean grammar, strong verbs. Figurative layering is dense but patterned early (“singing spirits,” “moonlight healing”) so it reads as taught texture, not purple overload. A few abstract nouns (“profound significance,” “weight of unspoken apologies”) slightly dilute immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but keeps propulsion via short beat-chains; no scaffolding loops. Metaphors occasionally layer (“lotus-hearted ache” + “gentle lapping of waves”) yet stay coherent within poetic register. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“unknot,” “graft”) advance action. Final third avoids overwritten closure beat—image carries weight, letting syntax breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive: “fresco fragment, half-buried…colors still vibrant” packs object, history, stakes in one stroke. No loops, no synonym churn; metaphors (“morbid perfume”) are singular and apt. Sentence variety is high—participial openers, em-dashes, fragmentary punch lines—mirroring painter’s bursts of attention. Only micro-slip: “within the fold of a daydream” is slightly vague, but it is brief and pays off in closure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths swell/contract with sonic build-up. Some modifier stacks (“gentle hum…soft lapping…methodically playful touch”) flirt with padding yet stay within tolerable density. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Information density good; a few filter verbs (“seemed to be pulsing”) dull immediacy but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences advance cleanly, but scaffold loops appear: “the community gardeners, oblivious… the community gardeners continued” and “message patterns… message patterns stood.” Metaphors are safe—“converging chaos” repeated without fresh image. Several near-paraphrase pairs slow momentum. Copy is otherwise clean; issue is rhythmic monotony, not grammatical failure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong auditory and color texture; sentences carry dual duty. Minor loop: “beauty”/“bloom”/“blossom” echo without new inflection; “centuries of longing” appears twice. No mixed metaphor or clarity break; rhythm breathes with lullaby cadence. Within high-band but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with purposeful sentence variety; information density high—each sentence layers image, motive, or stakes. Minor loop risk: “symphonies of truth” repeated four times without new inflection after midpoint. Metaphors coherent (ink well as vessel of essence) and don’t violate physics. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; no artifacts in final third. Opening/final lines echo container imagery, tightening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clear and readable, but suffers from scaffold loops: “ancient stones creaking and groaning,” “breathing… rhythm” reiterated with small variants four times; “dappled” recurs seven times without re-weighting. Metaphors are safe (“volcano… slow heartbeat”) and occasionally mixed (“whispers of the past” in metal chain). No artifacts in closing beat, so 9+ not disallowed, but density is low—many sentences do only one job. Could tighten by a third without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is plush but disciplined: each sensory line advances atmosphere or memory pressure. Minor loop: “dust motes swirled / the dust motes danced / dust motes swirling” three close repeats dull cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided; metaphor density fits reflective beat. Opening and closing lines mirror, creating circular ear-ring without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphors stack in almost every sentence (“drifting prism terrace,” “watercolors on wet paper,” “featherly determined”) producing lyric density that fits mood yet edges overwritten; no mixed vehicles harm clarity, but the final beat is delivered through haze rather than precise image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is loop-free, with high image-to-word ratio; each sentence layers ambience or micro-action. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous respite,” “shadowseam wonder”) is justified by lyric mode and pattern-taught. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding; opening and closing lines carry echo symmetry. A few adjective pairs could be trimmed, but artifact level is minor and never clogs the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Figurative density is high but patterned early—allowed under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “cheerful gloom” is deliberate oxymoron, not contradiction. One paraphrase loop—“the recollectionist felt… the recollectionist’s footsteps”—triggers −0.2. No synonym churn, no template cadence at closure. Information density is strong; each sentence layers image or knowledge without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical; few filters, no scaffold loops. Occasional soft metaphor overload (“stars like diamonds,” “calculated wilderness”) but not clustered in peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “sense of harmony… connection to the world around him” within three sentences −0.2. Closure image unaffected; prose stays limpid.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm modulates from languid opening cadences to clipped final fragments (“She departed…”), propelling the dance arc. Metaphors are coherent (stars as canvas, verse as skin) and avoid cross-threaded vehicles. Filter-verb clusters absent; information density high—one sentence often layers scent, sound, and motion. Minor paraphrase echo (“she stood there… she stood there”) is the only loop, not touching closure, so penalty is small.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence length varies, no template runs. Figurative language is restrained—only two moon metaphors, both purposeful. Occasional abstract lifts (“world of pain,” “delicate balance”) slightly dilute specificity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; clarity intact. Final paragraph tends toward lyrical repetition that mildly dulls closing punch.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud pleasant, but modifier stacks (“soft, ethereal light,” “gentle lapping waves”) create a lull that mirrors the static stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors, yet figurative language is decorative rather than causal. Sentence rhythm is varied; paragraphing supports mood. Density is moderate—good craft, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density: single sentences carry double duty—”yellowed film negative strip” reveals object, age, discovery method. No paraphrase loops; each mention of ivy/passage adds new shade. Metaphors stay coherent (“ivy-veiled” sustained without mixed vehicle). Minor scaffolding: repeated “it seemed” softens authority four times; none sit in closure beat, so 9+ still possible.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but controlled; metaphor strings serve accumulative color-music pattern and are taught early, avoiding purple overload. No synonym loops or template cadence. Occasional elevated phrases (“otherworldly light,” “divine”) skirt register edge but stay in voice. Information density is moderate; some sentences could do double duty yet prefer cadence over compression. Clean grammar; no spatial or temporal contradictions.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
    <comment>“Painting that coaxes mirrors into prophecy” is a fresh twist on artist-as-seer, executed with chromatic specificity rather than trope shorthand. Children’s song as code is inventive but under-deployed; mechanics remain vague. Dusky-harmony tone and prism parapet are memorable, yet plot arc is familiar lyric ascent to wonder. Risk level is moderate; concept does not retreat but also does not complicate the painter’s morality or failure state.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and readable; no scaffold loops or synonym churn stall momentum. Figurative language is restrained, but metaphoric abstractions (“sky whispered its approval”) flirt with purple without payoff. Information density is moderate—repeated “ancient terrace” and “ebony clipboard” feel decorative rather than textured. A few near-paraphrase lines (“price of redemption was steep,”“cost of failure was far greater”) dull precision without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with storm timing. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fractured grace,” “palimpsest of drought”) flirts with register drift but stays within lyric allowance. No scaffold loops; information dense—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors coherent; only minor near-repetition of “cracked” could trim 0.1, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; occasional “meteor hush”/“ghostly sentinel” poetic pairings verge on template cadence but stay sparse. Opening and closing lines anchor and re-weight motifs efficiently. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences. Information density is high—every sentence advances mood or motif—meeting 9- band technical bar, yet minor cadence echo prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lush but loops: “fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful” repeats conceptually; “gentle rustle… soft hum… soft, ethereal light” stacks near-synonyms. Sentence cadence is hypnotic yet monotonous; varied openings scarce. Some sentences do dual duty (action + image), but scaffold phrases (“as she…”) slow momentum. No mixed metaphors, yet overwriting blunts climax.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but purposeful: each sentence layers mythic texture without redundant paraphrase; no scaffold loops detected. Metaphors stay internally coherent (storm/dream/path) and support the accumulative lens. A few abstract nominalizations (“decaying directive,” “complex dance”) slightly dilute tactile immediacy yet occur outside high-pressure beats. Read-aloud rhythm modulates effectively; the final line lands cleanly without syntactic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence—yet pattern is taught early and sustains trance rhythm. Some loops (“the astronomer felt…”) and synonym churn (“celestial rhythms…cosmic harmony”) mildly dull propulsion near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful: the opening spondaic clusters (“soundless sanctuary,” “broken cylinder”) telegraph fracture, while the final paragraph’s soft fricatives mimic the fading hum. Metaphors are sparse and consistent—music as warp-thread of reality—never stacking into purple. One paraphrase loop (“harmony was possible…harmony that had been nurtured”) is forgivable at 700 words and does not touch the closure beat. High density: single sentences often fuse sensory cue, interior tilt, and world rule.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence music is strong—no template cadence or synonym loops—but figurative layering borders on overwrite: three frost metaphors in four lines near the climax. One paraphrase loop (“shimmer of twilight frost” echoed twice within 40 words) dulls the closure beat. Otherwise, information density is high; each sentence layers image or stakes. Copy is clean; pronouns track; no buried leads.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, occasionally lush without purple overload; sentences advance. Few soft loops—“tended… with a gentle reverence” then “worked with gentle reverence”—but not dense enough to stall. Metaphors stay organic (contract “withered”). Final line lands crisply, no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, no loops or mixed metaphors; however, figurative language is uniform across low- and high-pressure beats, dulling impact. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others glide on adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    Scaffold loops repeat (“labyrinthine bookstore,” “unheard symphony” echoed verbatim) and paraphrase clusters (“she realized that she had finally found… she realized that the journey had changed her”) dull momentum. Mixed metaphors (“the air seemed to vibrate with an unheard symphony”) blur physical logic. Filter verbs stack (“she felt,” “she knew”) during the climax, softening immediacy. Artifacts remain mid-level because they do not obscure the already-soft closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid, with strong sensory nouns and varied rhythm. Minor loop: “stories began to take on a life of their own” echoes earlier “stories she uncovered.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is high; each sentence advances image or insight. Closure image is crisp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentences are clean, varied in length, and free of scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is moderate—some beats double-dip (e.g., “she felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end” right after “the air seemed to vibrate”)—but redundancy is minor. Opening and closing lines frame the arc tidily. The prose is serviceable, never arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences do two jobs (“She held the stone, feeling its soothing vibrations, and began to examine…”). Figurative language is controlled—only two metaphors in final third, both paying off earlier motifs. No loops or scaffold; spatial/temporal sequences are clear. A single mixed micro-image: “rocks… being shaped by the vibrations into a state of tranquil equilibrium” implies external sculptor rather than internal resonance, but it does not cloud closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagistic density: “shard of hush,” “velvet expanse,” “thistle-blown hope.” However, three adjacent sentences open “As they…” creating template cadence; one paraphrase loop re-states “resonated with vibrations / still resonating.” Metaphors stay coherent, no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffolding dulls propulsion but does not obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is musical and dense; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Occasional metaphor stacks (“stormlit… crystal whispering forecourt”) risk purple tint but stay legible. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; information density remains high. One mixed proximity: “edge of the stormlit observatory” could imply precipice or balcony—slight spatial wobble, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence length varies, paragraphing breathes with dusk progression. Occasional Latinate loft (“serendipitous discovery”) nudges above POV’s likely diction, and a few soft loops (“glow” thrice in 30 lines) slightly dull texture. No metaphor collisions or scaffolding chains; information density is high. Line-level slips are minor but frequent enough to block 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence length undulates like breathing, mirroring tidal imagery. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; modifiers are sparse, nouns concrete. A single mixed metaphor—“luminescence of starlight filtering” (starlight doesn’t filter, gaps do) yields micro-ding. Otherwise clean, vivid, read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; no stacked figurative language in the float beat. Information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world-rule data—“objects… started to float, and a soft, golden light seeped into the air.” Sentence rhythm varies from staccato single clauses to longer carnivalesque catalog of silence-flavors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves on image that recharges doll and hush. No template cadence; each sentence advances story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold sentences. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fluidly logical mind,” “tangible representation”) edges toward register drift but stays consistent. A single mixed metaphor—“silence… vibrate with the gentle motion”—is forgivable at closure. Overall momentum breathes with the scene, though tighter verb economy could sharpen the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, but metaphor strings in peak beats (“nature’s own cathedral,” “whispers of the past,” “futuristic nostalgia”) layer abstraction on abstraction without new sensory payload. Some scaffold phrases (“With renewed determination,” “As the night wore on”) restate what the image already shows. No loops or typos; clarity stays intact, but density plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and paints image (“sweet with the scent of fungal growth and the soft glow”). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent. One register drift—“shadowseam wonder” coined phrase—feels authorial but brief, not muddling closure. Read-aloud cadence climbs naturally to the diamond shower.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud clean, with high sensory density. Occasional micro-loop: “the dynasty ender felt… the dynasty ender felt…” creates faint template cadence, but it never obscures causality. Metaphors stay coherent (“bridge of intuition,” “standing waves”). No scaffolding or paraphrase debt in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but loops (“reality shifted” / “as reality continued to shift”) and stacked mystical modifiers dilute immediacy. Strong auditory and olfactory specificity keeps momentum alive. Artifacts appear mid-scene, not in closure beat, so 9+ remains possible elsewhere but caps this category beneath 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Read-aloud rhythm generally smooth; some looping stems (“As Emilia…”) and abstract near-repeats (“stories… stories…”). Density decent—dust, button, file boxes reused. No mixed metaphors; no scaffold obscuring closure. Paraphrase loops minor but present; final paragraph stacks uplift abstractions without fresh image. Clean copy; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, but metaphor density is high without pattern payoff: stacked shimmer/glow/starlight clauses create looped sameness. Filter verbs (“seemed to,” “felt”) cushion immediacy. Scaffolding in “As she… As the…” openers repeats across paragraphs. No clarity breaks, yet musicality edges toward formulaic lyric rather than precision.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative layering is dense—almost every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is announced early (“music weaves through mist like breeze”) so taught and paid off. Mixed metaphors are avoided; coherence holds. Occasional scaffold (“the music is a vested hush, a deliberate attempt…”) is present but does not obscure causality or closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with the leaf cadence; sentences vary without algorithmic pattern. A few soft repeats (“glow,” “misty,” “ethereal”) and near-paraphrase clusters (“gentle glow,” “soft, ethereal radiance”) dull density, but they never obscure causality or stall closure. Clean punctuation and tactile verbs (“prod,” “shimmered”) outweigh the minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm breathes with scene shifts—longer sentences for waterfall echo, clipped phrases inside greenhouse. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or motion. A few soft metaphors—“world seemed full of possibility”—are generic but do not cluster in peak beats. Closure line is clean, with strong noun/verb choices: “darkness seemed to recede, the light… illuminating a path.”

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lines are lean, with high information density; metaphor vehicles stay consistent. A few scaffold phrases (“the weight of names,” “luminous regret”) recur without fresh inflection, and the final paragraph verges on paraphrase-loop uplift, dulling the edge of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional adjective stacks (“luminous ache,” “modestly fearless”) flirt with overwriting but recur as motifs. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; final paragraph breathes without deflating momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sentences carry strong visual texture yet suffer synonym loops: “ultraviolet forest…otherworldly energy…ultraviolet penance” restates the same concept. Overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: “mathematics of mercy” abstracts without concrete vehicle, blurring sense. Several participial openers create simultaneity hiccups (“As she walked, Elara began…”). Final-line echo (“I remember”) lands cleanly, but earlier scaffold lines (“She knew…she felt…”) could be cut without changing knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences flow with deliberate cadence; clauses lengthen then contract to mimic breath-held wonder. Information density is high—each sentence layers scent, sight, or metaphor. Figurative language is coherent and kept from purple excess by concrete nouns (“sand-wood and myrrh,” “shard of moonlight”). A few scaffold phrases (“it was on one such visit that…”) and one synonym loop (“hidden…overlooked…forgotten”) nudge this off 8-plus territory.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openers shift to keep momentum through the dust-pattern paragraph. Mixed metaphors are avoided, although “overhead fluorescent buzz dies” leans auditory on a visual object. Some scaffold exists in final-paragraph wind/ghost/crowd clustering; it is brief and does not touch closure, so cap harm is minor. High information density in early beats keeps the prose lean; later exposition about financial collapse is summary but justified by logbook device.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm is deliberate and incantatory; sentence openings vary; no template loops. Some near-synonym clusters (“soft, golden light,” “swirling clouds below”) soften density rather than sharpen. Metaphors stay coherent: glass/frost/cloud vocabulary never clashes. One scaffold: “the library seemed to be…” used twice; minor. Closure line is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but controlled; figurative layering serves atmosphere, not density bloat. One paraphrase loop (“light stolen by midnight” vs “reclaim the light”) and a few adjectival stacks near climax, yet meaning stays clear. Final crystalline note lands clean, no artifact touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lines are generally clean and read aloud well; concrete nouns (“leather-bound box,” “luminescent fungi”) outweigh modifiers. Yet the text leans on stock phrases—“a shiver run down her spine,” “breathed deeply”—and paraphrase loops: “stillness and the scent,” “stillness seep into her bones.” Figurative layering is light, so no muddle, but the repeated awe templates reduce propulsion. No artifacts touch closure, so stays above 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Loop screen flags: “she felt a sense of…” ×4; “the slide seemed…” ×3; −0.6. Mixed metaphor cluster: “turmoil of the sea and the stillness…combining to reimagine the world anew” −0.3. Info density moderate; several sentences perform only atmospheric duty. No artifact touches closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences for melt-time and clipped fragments during epiphany beats. Information density is high: one sentence often delivers season shift, pigment change, and emotional register. Occasional stacked modifiers (“vibrant hues of autumn,” “gentle rhythm of the night”) flirt with over-richness but remain pattern-consistent; no mixed metaphors or impossible physics. Scaffold-free aside from two near-paraphrases (“beauty captivating” vs “beauty and wonder”) that trim −0.2; closure image remains luminous and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; sentences vary in length and advance atmosphere. Occasional soft fillers—“strange and wondrous place,” “forgotten documents”—slightly dilute density. Metaphors stay coherent, register stable; no artifact obscures causality or closure. A tighter final-third cut of abstract qualifiers would edge toward 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and openers, avoiding template cadence. Occasional scaffold (“the alchemist’s eyes… the alchemist’s hands… the alchemist’s thoughts”) loops subject without deepening pressure; not severe enough to dull closure. Metaphors remain coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple overload, but density is light rather than multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new informational filament (wax, children, foghorn silence) without redundancy. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“velvet disquiet” crystallizes mood without purple swell. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“soft, golden glow”) that recharges prior lanterns. Syntax modulates naturally—no template cadence, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence lengths; however figurative strings stack in every sentence of the climax beat (“thousand tiny mirrors,” “fabric of time and space,” “kaleidoscope of images”) without pattern pay-off, dulling impact. Several near-paraphrase loops (“world as it had been… world as it would be”) and repeated “she felt” filter stems sap immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean and lyrical, but repeated abstract fillers (“simple life,” “humble life,” “true beauty”) create micro-loops that dull immediacy. Several sentences open with identical participial stems (“As she…”) forming template cadence. These artifacts never obscure causality but prevent high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean, occasionally lyrical, but leans on abstract nouns (“flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance”) that recycle the same stem. Sentence variety is moderate; paragraph breaks track meditation beats. No mixed metaphors or grammatical slips. Information density dips in repetitive thematic summaries near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence that mirrors the beat of ghost approach/dispersal. Figurative language is selective (“haunting echo,” “otherworldly glow”) and never clusters to stall momentum. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks detected. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter recharging the box’s glow as beacon—clean echo of earlier image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence variety and information density are high; each line advances image or pattern. Occasional soft repeats—‘timekeeper’s task…timekeeper’s presence…timekeeper’s journey’—mildly dull momentum but stop short of template cadence. Metaphors stay consistent (time as fabric, capsule as heart). No scaffolding obscures the final image; the prose is publish-ready with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is purposeful; sentence lengths ebb and flow with tide and breath. Occasional stacked modifiers (“gentle lapping...soothing melody...harmonize the very essence”) flirt with purple but serve lyric accumulation. No loops or scaffold; information is dense and forward-moving. Filter-verb counts are low; immediacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet purposeful; each sentence layers sensory detail or metaphor without scaffold loops. Occasional elevated diction (“palpable sense of anticipation,” “conceptual chemistry”) nudges toward thesaurus shimmer but stays within POV plausibility. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “bronze quiet” with earned resonance. A trace of ornamental surplus keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: no synonym loops, no scaffold repetition, strong verbs (“guided,” “halted,” “coaxing”) carry motion. Occasional elevated diction (“testament,” “ravages of time”) risks purple but stays within the coachman’s lexicon. One mixed metaphor—“blooming jetty” (jetty does not bloom)—barely grazes clarity. Otherwise clean grammar, varied sentence length, and strategic paragraphing propel the read.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean but leans on abstract pairings (“inexplicable tug,” “sense of connection”) where concrete gesture could stand. Several echo stems: “As they…/As the…” opens three sentences in forty words. No mixed metaphor or scaffold loops in closure beat; momentum stays steady. Read-aloud rhythm pleasant, yet information density rarely doubles duty.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, faintly lyrical; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are conventional (“stars twinkling like diamonds”) but unobtrusive. One simultaneity slip: “As she worked, the gilded compass rose applique seemed to glow” compresses cause and effect. Final paragraph drifts toward inspirational uplift (“brighter tomorrow”) that edges sentimental but stays within voice contract.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, occasionally lush—“swirling mists,” “burnished hue”—but metaphor strings cluster without pattern or payoff. Several near-paraphrases (“world below would soon be bathed… / sky… stretched out like an endless canvas”) dilute momentum. No scaffolding loops or pronoun drift; spatial tracking remains clear. Line-level craft is competent, not compressed; imagery is decorative, not choice-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean, with strong information density: each sentence layers symbol, setting, or emotional charge. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors, but faint template cadence in tripled adjective strings (“soft, deliberate pace”) and occasional filler “seemed to.” These scaffolds do not touch closure; final line is crisp and image-driven. Read-aloud rhythm varied.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace; clauses mirror mounting awe without algorithmic pattern. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, light, myth. Two soft loops: “labyrinthine bookstore” echoed close together; “hidden thunder” thrice, but pattern feels ritual, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences pull double duty—every image advances either tapestry decoding or guilt modulation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is sparse and coherent (“shroud of hush,” “ebbing of a tide”). Opening line anchors mood and stakes; final line resolves with image of door-closing threads. One micro-slip: “glittering portal that seemed to pulse” is filler “seemed”; still, the beat is brief and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no template cadence chains. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence—yet pattern is taught early (“towers of bone pierced the sky”) and paid off at closure, so −0.3 for density, not −0.7. Minor paraphrase loops (“truth she sought…truth she had uncovered”) create micro-scaffold; another −0.3. Typos and tense clean. Final line lands cleanly despite metaphor load.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variety is excellent; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is selective—acid sea, quilted memories—never stacked in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop exists: “the workshop creaked and groaned / the workshop creaked and groaned around her” two paragraphs apart (−0.2). Information density high; each line advances breath, pattern, or memory. Grammar clean; no simultaneity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative layer is restrained, never clogging the final third. One scaffold loop: “world around her melted away” appears twice with near-identical phrasing—−0.2. Otherwise crisp, high-density lines propel without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is lush but loops: “gentle whisper,” “gentle, insistent voice,” “screaming tenderness” recycle stems within 200 words. Metaphors sometimes layer (light dancing vs. whisper) without clash, but density approaches purple in climax. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or scent. Still, the ornamental cadence slows propulsion enough to cap high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Loop-free, high density; most sentences couple observation with interior flick (“canvas of shadows and light…open wound”). Minor overwriting haze in stacked abstract nouns—“raw solace,” “geography of loss”—that verge on slogan. Metaphors are coherent (patchwork self, moon as compass) but slightly familiar; fresher vehicle would sharpen final line. Punctuation, tense, pronouns clean; no scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold (“they realized that… they began to… they felt a sense of…”). Metaphors stay spare and coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple clusters. Information density is decent—one sentence often layers action, setting, and interior—but several adjacent sentences still open with “As they…” creating light template cadence that keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rhythm is supple; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is restrained, but two mixed metaphors (“repository of memories,” “echoing chamber”) momentarily blur the lighthouse’s logic. Information density is high; only micro-hedges (“perhaps,” “for a moment”) dilute propulsion. Clean copy, no typos.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence runs. Occasional scaffold: “As the creek…, as she…” opener pair, but distance brief, not looped. Figurative control solid—“glimmer in fading light,” “sweet scent of blooming flowers”—vehicles clean, no mixed metaphors. Information density moderate: some sentences single-task (“She smiled, knowing…”) yet momentum sustained; hedges minimal. Line clarity high; no typos, tense stable. Artifact-light enough to stay above 6.5.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative language is vivid yet dense—five metaphors in the first 120 words—without pattern-teaching, risking purple haze. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; pronoun references clean. However, “sense of… sense of…” template cadence recurs four times, a minor scaffold artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud clean, but figuration repeats (“glowed softly…warm orange light danced…ember nexus pulsed and glowed”) in adjacent sentences, creating paraphrase loops. No mixed metaphors, yet density drifts toward purple in the final third. Scaffolding phrases (“in that moment,” “as she worked”) recur. Closure image is clear, so cap −0.6 for ornament accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid yet loops (“The feeling was… I couldn’t shake…”) and stacks filter verbs that dull immediacy. Metaphors (“maelstrom,” “kaleidoscope”) are stock; no mixed vehicles, but the cadence never accelerates under pressure, keeping density moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud cadence is lush but loops twice: “trembling calm” + “ordinary miracles” each appear three times without pattern-teaching, drumming home the lyric pulse. Mixed metaphor risk—“web of connections” beside “mirror or contrast”—never snaps because fog image holds unity. Scaffolding minimal; sentences carry double-duty (sound + emotional mapping). One filter-verb cluster at climax keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Figurative language is restrained—only two metaphors in 800 words—so no density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “the platform continued to drift, a tiny, serene world” twice in closing paragraph costs −0.2. Punctuation and tense clean; no simultaneity errors. Opening and final lines serve as frame anchors, not scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined: “scent of aged paper and forgotten melodies” packs sensory and emotional data in one stroke. Two micro-loops: “imperfect miracles” repeated verbatim; “hush before the orchard” cited twice without escalation. No mixed metaphors; physical logic intact. Final sentence lands with satisfying cadence, recharging “grit” and “ethereal” motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns (“discord,” “illusions,” “harmony”) that dilute sensory immediacy. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same stillness (“silence around her grew, a resounding hush that enveloped the world”)—minor loop, −0.2. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor the tone, yet mid-section density drops when imagery repeats without new information.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and tidal, mirroring clock oscillations; sentence openings vary. Several near-paraphrase loops (“the shepherd... the shepherd...”) across adjacent sentences create mild template cadence, deduct −0.4. Figurative language is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate—descriptive passages occasionally overstay—but never stalls momentum enough to obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, readable; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“quiet wildfire” is the single metaphor, aptly repeated). Information density is moderate; some sentences summarize rather than advance (“she was on the cusp…” repeats the same beat twice). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve competently. No artifacts touch closure, but lack of texture in peak beat keeps it from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; only “gentle glow” repeats twice without fresh angle. Metaphors stay coherent (certainty as shadow). Opening and closing images book-end neatly. Occasional scaffold (“As the days passed…”) compresses time efficiently, not clumsily.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.1)
    Looping sentence stems (“as the operator…”) and paraphrase loops (“a sort of loop… the loop… continue the loop”) create scaffold drag; density is low for 700 words. Metaphors stay safe and compatible, but no sentence propels with surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean, but “blooming blooming” proximity and echoed “weight of small moments” create mild paraphrase loops. Several sentences open with “As…” or “The archivist…” in runs, producing template cadence. Metaphors (“ethereal glow,” “ripple effect”) are familiar; no mixed vehicles but lack freshness. Closure line avoids clutter, so artifact does not blunt final image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. A few elevated phrases (“conceptual cost of cosmic kindness”) flirt with register drift but pass. Information density is moderate—some thematic shorthand could be cut. Closure image is clear, unmuddied by figurative overgrowth.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary; no template churn. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, sound, or light. One mixed metaphor cluster: “quiet blaze of discovery and introspection” fuses fire + silence + abstract noun; it recurs four times, dulling impact by closure. Minor simultaneity slip: “raised their face to the sky” while “footsteps slowed” in the same beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding sentences survive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, high-density; each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops; figurative language is sparse and functional (“fabric… spider’s web”). Opening and final lines carry echoing charge. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she began”) in mid-section dull immediacy but do not touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentence rhythm swells and contracts to mirror musical rise; scaffold is minimal—one paraphrase loop (“luminous harbor by moonlight” vs. “moonlit harbor”) but it serves incantatory effect. Mixed metaphors avoided; “tuning the atmosphere to a different frequency” is single sustained metaphor. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene pace; paragraph lengths vary to create visual swell. Some abstract intensifiers (“heavy with emotion,” “canopy of light”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No synonym loops or template cadence; information density is high. Final line lands cleanly, recharging “stars” and “shadows” without scaffolding. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to whisper”) keep it from 8+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm swells and subsides with sentence-length variation; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—one metaphor per beat—so lagoon = mirror/memory never muddles physics. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral,” “entangled”) is motivated by the speculative frame and echoed consistently; no mixed registers intrude at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, readable, and free of scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Density is modest; most sentences advance atmosphere or observation. Yet momentum stalls in repeated “as she” openers and static cataloguing of artifacts; no syntactic escalation mirrors the supposed rising storm. Closure image is vague, leaving no lasting auditory or tactile aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush yet propulsive; figurative density is high but patterned (mirror = moon, lattice = constellation) so the lyric mode is earned. A few near-repetitions (“stillwater tension” twice, “unreadable expression” twice) create minor loops. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Final image is sharp, but the preceding paragraph drifts into incremental rephrasing of calm.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is fluid but leans on abstract nouns and prepositional堆叠 (“in the cobalt library...with the scent...of forgotten knowledge”) that slow propulsion. Several template cadences (“as the night deepened,” “as the first light...”) repeat across paragraphs. Metaphors (“cradle the weight of the world”) are mixed yet don’t obscure causality since causality is already weak. No paraphrase loops or artifacts touch the final beat, keeping line-level above median.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “weathered fishing boats that bobbed” hands the reader motion and age in four words. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “the world was changing; violence was becoming a relic” tells what the scene already shows. Final image line breathes cleanly, propelling closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrically textured yet disciplined: “weave a spell of remade hush” risks purple but earns its place via repetition pattern. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or cadence. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-anchored. Occasional stacked modifiers (“desolate yet strangely serene backdrop”) are the closest to overwriting but never obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—vehicles stay within light/sound/frost domain. Minor template cadence near midpoint (“with each step…with a sense of liberation…”) but rhythm soon re-varies. No mixed metaphors or loops in the closure beat. Read-aloud ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean grammar, no looped paraphrase or synonym churn; sentences advance image or beat. Overuse of participial openers and “as” clauses creates a lulling cadence that dulls urgency. Metaphors (“plants seemed to dance”) are familiar; no mixed vehicles. Information density adequate—each sentence adds setting or emotional hue. No artifacts touch closure; final image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sentences carry double duty—description plus motion—with clean grammar and no scaffold loops. Metaphors (“music was like a warm breeze”) are familiar but not mixed; no overwriting clusters. Information density is high; paragraphs advance stakes or texture. Only minor cliché gusts keep it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with prepositional phrases, participles, and concrete nouns without falling into template cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial rhythms,” “otherworldly light”) risks register drift but stays consistent with observatory grandeur. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; information density is high. Minor scaffolding in repeated “as they worked” stems, but never within closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, but iterative anaphora (“As the…”) and stacked participial phrases create minor template cadence that dulls propulsion. Metaphors (“portal to the hidden patterns”) are coherent yet numerous enough to flirt with density debt. No scaffold loops or synonym churn obscure causality, but the prose lingers in lyrical overlay rather than information density. Closure line (“world that was just a little bit more mysterious”) is pleasing but generic, capping the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphors are generally coherent, yet stacked abstracts (“atoms of nostalgia,” “threshold beyond which lay a realm of unmitigated truth”) risk purple abstraction without tactile grounding. Several sentences paraphrase the same emotion in adjacent clauses, creating minor loop drag. Punctuation and grammar are clean; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and final lines anchor and echo effectively, but the middle beats could trade some lyric surplus for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled, sentences varied; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“shadow… spreading tendrils”). Information density high—each line advances atmosphere or insight. Minor scaffold: “softly deliberate” is reused without fresh angle, and “luminous regret” approaches label-speak, but neither artifact touches the closing image. Closure clarity intact, so stays above 7.0 cap for artifact-free final third.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose breathes: long anaphoric sentences mirror mist, short beats mimic chameleon flick. No synonym loops; each return of “mist” or “shed” accrues new pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—glass vessel, river course—anchored in workshop water and starlight. One scaffold trace: “layer by layer” appears twice within ten lines; trim one instance and the ceiling rises to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Varied sentence openings and rhythms; only two scaffold phrases (“the air was heavy…”) not repeated enough to loop. Metaphors stay coherent—earth as confidant, plants as fingers—without mixed vehicles. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. No artifacts in closure beat; minor over-adjectival drift (“ethereal fingers,” “boundless sea”) keeps it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is evocative yet loops its own metaphors—“lingering,” “resonate,” “echo” recur within adjacent sentences. Several lines do double duty, but others restate the same ache twice. No mixed metaphors, yet the sustained mournful diction edges toward purple. Copy is clean; only minor scaffold detected. The final image would survive a trim of two adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe with aurora pulses. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but pattern is taught early and sustains lyric mode without mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “across the unwritten calendar” is repeated conceptually not actionally. No loops or synonym churn in final third; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies: long breathy clauses yield to staccato image-kicks (“frozen at midnight, its still hands”). Metaphors are internally coherent—no mixed vehicles. Occasional near-loop (“glowing dune… dune’s glow”) is isolated; no paraphrase churn. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. A few adjectival floaters (“ethereal glow,” “otherworldly energy”) flirt with purple but stay within lyric allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Read-aloud cadence is pleasant, yet paraphrase loops abound: “the hum of insight grew louder” appears six times with minimal variation. Metaphors mix gently (“symphony of vibrations” beside “roar”) without violating physics, but density feels padded. Several sentences open with participial scaffolding that slows propulsion. Final third is clean of major artifacts, keeping score above 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush yet lean, no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“serpent through the twilight”) are coherent. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mist that swirled with an otherworldly energy”) flirt with over-density, but clarity survives. Final image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for drift, clipped fragments for creak-door moment. Figurative control strong—“blanket of snow,” “sponge” walls—no mixed metaphors. Paraphrase loops absent; however, “silence” noun repeated 9×, “stillness” 4×; template cadence noticeable, not yet obstructive. High information density; each paragraph advances atmosphere or interior tilt. A few adjectival stacks (“seraphically mundane air”) flirt with purple but serve tone.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is lush but loops: “trail of subtle hints and clues” + “trail of mysterious annotations” within four lines; “rune of drift” repeated four times without new inflection. Mixed metaphors—“fabric of reality poised on the brink of a great and irreversible change”—add decorative blur. Strong auditory rhythm, but density exceeds payoff in peak beats. No grammar slips; pronoun tracking clean.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent (“fish swimming just beneath the surface” fits her world). Occasional elevated phrasing (“her spirit soar”) edges toward generic uplift, but it occupies a single line and does not obscure causality. Paragraphing breathes with emotional cadence; opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: a single sentence can map sulfur scent, plant whispers, and tactical scan. No mixed metaphors; geothermal logic stays coherent. Minor scaffold in “As she walked… As she worked… As she rounded…” but it never obscures cause/effect and is outside the closure third. Final line “lotus blooming in the sun” is familiar, yet justified by embryo’s golden glow and plant chorus, so only a −0.2 nick. Otherwise clean, legible, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong auditory and tactile specificity; sentences advance atmosphere or interiority. Several near-metaphors in one paragraph (“blue-gray silk,” “branding iron”) slightly overcluster yet do not obscure. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts clean. Final line avoids explanatory tag, trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is musical, but purple clustering in every sentence of final paragraph dulls impact. Metaphors (“luminescent ache,” “river of threads”) recur without mutation, creating loop. No scaffolding or synonym churn, yet density approaches overwriting. Closure image still lands clear, capping deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long tracking lines to the staccato of “Kael smiled, a small, enigmatic smile.” No synonym churn or template cadence detected. One mixed metaphor—“sea of uncertainty”—is minor. High information density: the drone is gift, sensor, and comfort in one clause. Closure image is crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, image-dense, almost no filler; each sentence advances either snow, screen, or secret. One paraphrase loop—“the conversation… the conversation”—is forgivable. Metaphors stay coherent (snowflakes as countdown) and don’t clot the urgency. Near-perfect read-aloud rhythm; the piece could print as-is after a light copy-edit.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical, mostly free of loops; however, “the gentle…, the gentle…, the gentle…” cadence drifts toward template near paragraph 3, not quite taught as motif. Mixed metaphors avoided; rose/light imagery stays coherent. Information density high—each sentence layers scent, color, or symbolism. A few near-duplicate abstractions (“sense of continuity, sense of purpose”) could compress without loss.</question>
    <question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
    <comment>Pacifist bounty-hunter’s daughter cultivating weaponized beauty is fresh; serene dome amid wasteland feels inevitable, not gimmick. Roses-from-wreck and engraved stone repurpose detritus into life without overt eco-sermon. Risk is quiet—no battle, no invasion—and the story commits to that gamble, earning a modest originality bonus. Could swap “tower” for any generic apocalypse, so specificity earns B+ not A+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with purposeful variation in sentence length to mimic wave-hum. Information density dips slightly in the middle where “legend had it” exposition stalls motion for one beat. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; “patterns break themselves” repeats but is pattern-taught, hence allowed. Overall clean, but one scaffold sentence (“the act of transliterating…”) states what is already shown, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts track mandala phases. One paraphrase loop (“world… coming into focus”) repeated; no mixed metaphors. Density high without purple overload; sand, mist, whisper vehicles stay coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Minor scaffold but nothing obscures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between lyrical elongation and stark declaratives, mirising grief-pulse. No loops or synonym churn; “shattered sky” appears once and sticks. One mixed metaphor—“echoes of her words faded” paired with air vibration—minor, doesn’t obscure closure. High density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic labour.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is supple and dense, but repeated abstract pairings (“whispers of forgotten melodies,” “fabric of reality”) create near-paraphrase loops that dull the final third. One mixed metaphor—“distilled into a potent elixir” beside “timeline repair”—muddies causality at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm with natural sentence-length variation; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory or emotional data without scaffold. No paraphrase loops or simultaneity errors. Metaphors are coherent (“sea of mental images”) and do not stack in closing beats. Minor template echo of “delicate, glittering” but it never obscures causality or the closure image. Proofing is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cavern pacing; sentence openings vary. Several near-loops (“winding tunnels…twists and turns,” “secrets and mysteries”) slacken density. Metaphors of tide and current hold without contradiction, but a few soft intensifiers (“mesmerizing,” “otherworldly”) cushion rather than sharpen images. No artifact obscures closure, keeping score above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lovely cadence but metaphor density borders purple (“amber warehouse… crucible… alchemy”) and slightly numbs peak closure beat. Several paraphrase loops (“the prophecy was not a fixed destiny, but a raw possibility” restated thrice) create scaffold drag. Sentence variety good; no grammar slips. Information density high; yet tightening the last third by 15% would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence layers scar memory, mist motion, or tactile detail. No paraphrase loops; “silver hush” repetition is thematic drum, not scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (mist as shroud, branches as fingers). Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One participle opener (“gazed out into the mist”) is simultaneous but physically plausible. Final line lands on image, not explanation—clean cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences for drift, short shards for glint. Figurative layer is thick (“palimpsest promise,” “spindrift serenity”) yet internally coherent; metaphors stay maritime and textile, no mixed vehicles. Some scaffold near-identical adjectives (“gentle hand,” “gentle lapping”) but not in closure beat. Overall ear is sonorous, underwriting the meditative stall without stalling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is mostly varied, but clusters of participial openers (“baking… withering… catching…”) create template cadence; metaphors stay coherent, yet some sentences lean on ornamental pairing (“sharp gentleness,” “fragile balance”) that stall propulsion. No loops obscure causality, but the final beat is slightly padded.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm alternates between long floral clauses and short pulse beats, matching breath of night work. Figurative layer is dense but coherent—metaphors (city holding breath, spell of protected vulnerability) stay inside horticultural/lock-picking lexicon. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or conceptual grain. Minor scaffold: “as if” hedges appear three times; none dilute closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density: each sentence layers image, memory, and bodily resonance. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; metaphors stay coherent (cloud wisps, glass shatter). Minor register lift (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) is acceptable at distance; does not infect peak beat. Sentence rhythm modulates with long calm lines and shorter pulses under light change.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence openings vary, paragraph cuts clean. Occasional soft scaffold: “As the… / As she…” stem repeats 3×, but never in peak beat. Metaphors (cloud-burst, prismatic quiet) stay coherent and thematic, not piled. No synonym churn or filter-verb clog; information density high, momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate, no template cadence clusters. Information density is high—each sentence advances action or atmosphere without scaffold. Metaphors (“stars twinkled like diamonds”) are stock but brief and do not obscure logic. One paraphrase loop occurs: “symbol of the power of determination and ingenuity” restates the prior sentence’s claim; a −0.2 nudge applies, but the closure image remains clear. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    High metaphor density in final third—“fabric of reality torn asunder,” “starlight pouring”—without pattern or payoff. Adjacent paraphrase: “ancient ones…lost to time” echoed twice in 30 words. Filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she realized”) soften immediacy. Otherwise clean grammar, varied sentence lengths. Read-aloud rhythm survives despite decorative overload.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Figurative layering is moderate—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “as the mist swirled around them” appears twice in adjacent beats; not at closure, so −0.3. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density: one sentence often layers ancestral relic, meteorological anomaly, and textual puzzle. No scaffold loops; metaphors coherent (“spongey dread” sustains tactile image). Occasional elevated phrase (“metaphysical displacement”) nudges above POV ceiling but brief. Final line cadence decisive—earned pause.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths modulate from long breathless coils to short coda beats. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or mood—yet occasional stacked modifiers (“mist-shrouded peaks,” “otherworldly light”) flirt with purple. No paraphrase loops, but the word “luminous” is granted three sightings, nudging self-repetition. Overall momentum remains musical, propelling the reader downhill even when very little actually happens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, scaffold-free; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent: rust = forgotten dreams, money = world vastness. One paraphrase echo: “polished calm” appears twice without fresh spin. Clause rhythm occasionally drifts into lullaby cadence, softening propulsion, but never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths breathe with the night’s slow passage. Some minor scaffold: “the stars above seemed to twinkle…” and similar星光 refrains edge toward template cadence, but they reinforce accumulative design rather than obscure causality. Metaphors stay consistent (star-light = knowledge). No mixed vehicles or purple overload. Tightening could remove a few adjectives (“gentle hum,” “soft glow”), but the line-level craft is above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Information density is moderate; several sentences perform double duty describing setting while advancing motion. Paraphrase loops appear (“the druid’s attribute…had led them to this moment” restated twice within 60 words). Mixed metaphors (“branches twisted…like living serpents” alongside “vortex” and “veil”) coexist without pattern-teaching, creating minor coherence drag. Scaffolding phrases (“they knew,” “they felt”) soften declarative power; pruning them would sharpen propulsion. No grammar errors, but rhythm remains metronomic, lacking breath-control that could echo the vortex swirl.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence loops. Some metaphor stacks (“cobalt hue,” “anxious elation,” “ethereal light”) border on purple but stop short of muddling causality. Occasional scaffold: “the scent of damp earth and blooming wildflowers filling her lungs” restates what “deep breath” already shows. Overall propulsion is smooth; figurative excess never obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm modulates well—long aromatic clauses contract to short ritual imperatives during spell. Figurative layer is dense (every other sentence) but pattern-taught early and paid off in final glow, so density penalty waived. Only scaffold: two adjacent “as she” participial openers create template cadence; minor loop fixed by cut. No mixed metaphors; props track.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, efficient; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“echo valley longing,” “celestial map”) edges toward poetic generics but stays within voice tolerance. Opening and closing lines are crisp. High density; no overwritten beats. Minor earnest uplift in final paragraph keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is steady; sentence openings vary. Paraphrase loops recur (“wisps… dissipated into the misty veil,” “mist swirling around her ankles,” “last wisps of mist disappeared”)—three echoes of identical mist image without reweighting, −0.4. No mixed metaphors or heavy scaffold; prose is clean but low-density.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluid, rhythmic, with only minor scaffold (“the librarian’s… the librarian’s…”). Figurative language dense but patterned early, so forgiven. No tense slips or synonym loops. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts clean. Information density moderate—some sentences perform single job. Final image crisp, unmuddled.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of scaffold; some modifier stacks (“soft, ethereal light,” “deep-seated motivation”) edge toward template cadence. Abstract nouns occasionally substitute for concrete action (“felt a sense of purpose wash over her”). No mixed metaphors or grammatical slips, but density drops in closing generalities.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose breathes: sentence length and stress vary with musical/footnote beats; no template cadence runs. Occasional micro-scaffold: “mended and the broken” repeated thrice—justified motif, not loop. Mixed-metaphor risk in “world shifted…revealing hidden patterns” is saved by immediate sensory anchoring. Density high; adjectives earned. No artifact clutters the final lament; accordion image lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of scaffold, but figurative layering is dense in every sentence; no pattern is taught to justify the surplus, so a −0.3 density penalty applies. Mixed metaphors (“library hung like mistletoe”) clang slightly yet do not break causal clarity. Template cadence appears in the repeated anaphora “The dreamer…” and “The mist…,” deducting another −0.3. No typos or tense slips. Information density is moderate; many sentences do only one job, trimming could free 60–80 words without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud cadence is deliberate, sentence variance good; some scaffolding (“the violin’s history… now lay before her like an open book”) restates prior beat. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Near-duplicate “velvet” and “threads” tokens verge on loop but serve accumulative design, so penalty light.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, largely loop-free; figurative language is patterned and paid off. One scaffold pair—“the world around her began to slow… world contracting to a single, shining point”—repeats conceptually; trimming one would sharpen momentum. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo, syntax varied, metaphors internally consistent. Closure image pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth but cadence grows repetitive: 13 sentences open with “As she” within 150 words, creating template monotony. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is low—sentences often repeat the same emotional beat in new adjectives (“gentle,” “soothing,” “serene”). Minor loop artifacts accumulate yet do not obscure causality or blur the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean, with only minor scaffold: repeated “cloak of doubt” phrasing and mirrored abstracts. No mixed metaphors or density clutter; sentences do double duty advancing atmosphere. A few filter verbs (“seemed to whisper”) slightly dull immediacy, but momentum holds. Closing paragraph drifts into iterative summary, softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud smooth, with purposeful repetition of “sycamore hush” and “gentle lapping” to sustain trance. Occasional scaffold phrases (“the patterns in the pond continued to evolve”) restate rather than advance. No mixed metaphors or tense slips; clarity stays high. Information density is moderate—many sentences do one job—keeping the piece below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean, but “whispers of the ancients,” “intricate dance between hunter and prey,” and “labyrinthine canyons of the past” are template metaphors that recycle familiar phrasing without fresh twist. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same stillness concept, creating micro-loops that dull momentum. No artifact touches the closure beat, so capping stays sub-critical. Overall, ear is adequate, not exhilarating.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Loops: “lingering luminance” appears 4× with near-paraphrase; “brilliant dimness” twice. Metaphors occasionally stack (“winds howled like a chorus of the forgotten”; “flowers that shone like tiny stars”) without pattern payoff. Scaffolding: “she felt… she knew… she realized…” filters three successive beats. Otherwise syntax is clean, propulsion steady; no grammar errors or impossible simultaneity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; metaphor strings are patterned, not cluttered. No synonym loops or paraphrase beats. Occasional elevated register (“luminous vows,” “celestial map”) borders on decoration but stays coherent. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle; momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are clean, free of loops or scaffold, but figurative density is high in every sentence without pattern-teaching payoff (“velvet expanse,” “diamonds,” “fabric of space-time rewoven”). Register stays elevated, matching tone, yet the unbroken shimmer becomes monotonous rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm varies gracefully; sentence openings avoid mechanical repetition. Figurative language is restrained—one metaphor per beat—so density never stalls momentum. Occasional elevated diction (“unyielding passage of time”) fits the reaper’s timeless stance. One scaffold trace: “the reaper’s heart remained…” is repeated with slight paraphrase; a minor −0.2, not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally lean, image-rich lines; a few perfume/decay couplings verge on purple but stay pattern-consistent. One scaffold loop: “trail of photographs” + “trail of images” within 30 words (−0.2). No metaphor clash. Final sentence propulsion lands cleanly. Good read-aloud rhythm; minor tightening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush yet efficient; most sentences double-duty (sense + metaphor). No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are rare; “danced with colors of the rainbow” is cliché but isolated. Filter verbs minimal. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight. One overwritten pocket: “trees that bore fruits of every shape and hue, their branches tangled...” restates visually. Closure line is clean, luminous. Overall strong control with minor glitter excess.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sentence rhythm varies from long gear-describing clauses to staccato dawn fragments. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors (velvet sky, diamond stars) stay single-layer and sensory. Information dense: one line slips setting, body, and emotional charge (“the silence…reverberate through every cell”). Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rhythm breathes with the meditation cadence; sentence variety is good, but three consecutive sentences open with “As he…” creating a template cadence that dulls peak pressure. No mixed metaphors or strained figures. Information density is moderate; some lines summarize (“the world below continued to change”) instead of vivifying. No loops or typos; copy is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is fluid, with varied sentence openings and natural paragraph cuts. Figurative language (“seed seemed to absorb light”) is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. A few minor loops—“flow of ideas and creativity guiding her”—but these occur in low-pressure summary, not at closure. Information density is high; each sentence advances interiority or atmosphere without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Figurative language is dense—every sentence carries a metaphor—yet most repay with acoustic logic. Mixed metaphors intrude: “macerated the silence” is vivid but physically off. Paraphrase loops appear (“the household that once resonated with joy, now a hollow shell” echoed twice). Still, rhythm supports breathless tunnel acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: no synonym loops, no template cadence. Figurative layering—“damp shroud,” “ethereal tentacles”—is dense yet coherent under lyric mode. One mixed metaphor (“interiorize exteriors”) is abstract but fits accumulative lens. Final image is uncluttered, allowing 9-band consideration; minor density keeps it mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but stacked metaphor density in the climax beat (“penny drops…fabric of reality rent asunder”) edges toward purple. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, yet repeated “as if” constructions create faint pattern artifact. Information density is high—each sentence layers image and concept—but metaphor coherence slips once when “frozen bloom” collides with “scorched earth.” Line-level clarity survives, but the figurative excess keeps the score shy of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluid, but metaphor density climbs toward purple in the final third (“symphony,” “threads of reality,” “veil of perception”) without pattern justification. Several sentences repeat the same abstract nominal structure (“she felt… she knew… she saw”). No scaffolding loops or typos; clarity intact. Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet risks monotony from cumulative anaphora.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is sensuous and varied, but overwriting drags: stacked star/grotto metaphors in consecutive sentences and repeated “spectral/gossamer” qualifiers dilute immediacy. Several near-paraphrase loops (“shift and flow like the sands… world shifting, flowing…”) stall momentum in the final paragraph, preventing high-band polish.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative runs are patterned early (“ever-shifting landscape”) so density feels earned, not purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or cadence. Minor simultaneity slips (“as she walked, the exhibits began to erupt”) but timeline stays legible. Final line lands clean, recharging “pattern” and “thread” without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers setting, metaphor, and thematic cue with minimal scaffold. A few soft loops—repetitions of “once a place of darkness,” “unfolded horizons” twice—dent momentum slightly. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles or purple stacks. Clean grammar, strong verb choices, and purposeful paragraphing support propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean copy: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips. Rhythm alternates sentence length, avoiding drumbeat. Occasional soft filler—“the mist around them began to clear, as if the atrium itself was responding to her words”—uses weak “began to” and explanatory “as if.” Metaphors are few, safe, unstrained. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances stance or image. Final line ends on sonic echo (“reeling hush”) rather than fresh image, slightly undercutting propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clean grammar, vivid nouns (anemones, codex), no scaffold loops. Mixed metaphor risk: “monolith… covered in anemones” (stone vs. living tissue) but image holds. One paraphrase loop: “secrets of the undersea cables that crisscrossed the ocean floor” restates in next sentence. Clarity never impedes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative density peaks in ink-study paragraph yet serves pattern. One paraphrase loop: “snow seemed…seemed to echo” triggers minor ding. No mixed metaphors; temporal sequence is clear. Final line lands with image-earned hush. Read-aloud rhythm is hypnotic, almost too even—lulls rather than pierces.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid, strain-free metaphors (“towers of bone pierced the sky like shattered stalactites”) and precise noun choice (“copper-veined storyteller”) keep texture high. Occasional template cadence—“The storyteller watched, entranced… The storyteller’s task…”—dulls momentum in one patch. No mixed metaphors or therapy-speak. Final third is clean, allowing 8-band territory, but the earlier cadence ripple keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid and readable, with strong sensory nouns and verbs; no synonym loops or template cadences. Metaphor count is moderate and scene-driven. Two minor scaffolding phrases (“a sense of unease,” “a sense of grim determination”) could be compressed. Static description repeats “static-laden” twice but serves pattern; no mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Closure line breathes cleanly, achieving imagistic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is fluid but relies on abstract clusters—“shimmered like stardust,” “music drifted…weaving a spell”—that blur more than sharpen. Several paraphrase loops (“the orchard was…”) stall momentum. No grammatical fault, yet density is diluted; final glow line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence variance good. Occasional template stems—“the mailman…,” “the thunderstorm…”—recur without pattern payoff, minor loop debit. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density decent; some lines perform only atmospheric duty. No artifact touches closure, so holds low-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is musical and mostly concise, but figurative layering becomes dense in every sentence (“rusty wheels told tales,” “halo fragment’s gentle glow illuminating the face”). Template cadence appears (“the carpenter… the carpenter…” anaphora) without pattern payoff. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, yet overwriting blurs peak mist/oasis beats. Final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high density without metaphor pile-up; each sentence layers sensory job + emotional charge (“camera...extension of their being”). Only minor scaffold: “the ritual was not just...it was” restates intent, and “again and again” nudges template cadence late. These touches nick 0.2, leaving lyrical momentum intact through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is musical, but modifier stacks (“enigmatic locksmith moved with a purpose that belied their unassumingly bold nature”) create slight scaffolding. No loops or synonym churn, yet figurative density remains high across the entire piece without variation, dulling the climax. Read-aloud rhythm is strong but uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe. Figurative language is dense but patterned (decay-perfume, thread, constellations) and justified by the lyric mode. One scaffold loop: “memories she had lost were still out there” repeats conceptually across two sentences—minor, not closure-touching. No mixed metaphors or register drift; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is musical but leans on “seemed” hedges four times, softening authority. Metaphors are coherent (tea leaves as “tiny, twisted creatures”) yet crowd successive sentences, dampening urgency. No scaffold loops or synonym churn, but density drops during the three-sentence “As…” chain in the climax, slightly dulling the closure image. Otherwise grammar and tense are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is musical yet loops: “woven,” “weave,” “fabric” recur within three sentences; “wonder” appears eight times. Mixed metaphors—seed as both camera-capture and thread—create minor coherence drag. Scaffolding phrases (“it was said,” “she felt”) pad beats without new information. Overall momentum is slowed by lush restatement; one-third of sentences could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid and sentence openings vary; however, near-loop phrases (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”) recur across adjacent sentences, creating scaffold churn (−0.3). Information density is moderate—some sentences do only atmospheric work. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked in clusters. No artifact touches the final line, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences are clean, readable, with occasional elegant compression. Minor loop: “rain continued to fall” echoed; “she felt” filter stacks 3× in 200-word span. No metaphor clutter or register drift. Information density is moderate—some summary of footage work that could be dramatized. Final third is clear, so 9+ not disallowed, but not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentence rhythm varies from languid accumulative clauses to staccato revelations; paragraph cuts coincide with artifact discoveries, keeping momentum. Information density high—one sentence often fuses sensory data, interior inference, and world fact. Two micro-loops: “salt and decay” + “saltwater and the weight” could compress; “the phrase resonated” is a filter verb that slightly dulls immediacy. No metaphor contradictions; closing simile is precise. Overall, line-level craft supports the lyric accumulative mode without obscuring the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences vary in length and opening, creating natural read-aloud rhythm; density is high—each line layers sensory, symbolic, and emotional work. Occasional adjective clusters (“intricately carved flower press bolt plate”) verge on purple but stay motivated by her artifact-focused gaze. No synonym loops or filter-verb stacks; no scaffolding. Minor over-modification in peak beats prevents 9+ but does not obscure closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentences vary in length; no template cadence or synonym loops. Scaffolding minimal—only “the elevator’s gentle hum and the soft hiss” feels slightly double-stated. Metaphors (“whisper secrets”, “map that led her”) are sparse and coherent. Final line lands clean; no artifacts touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports contemplative escalation without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lyrical yet efficient; high density in lines like “empty spaces remembered, holding the essence.” Occasional ornamental pairing (“kaleidoscope of shapes and textures”) slightly pads, but metaphor logic holds. No scaffold loops or tense slips. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs anchor motion. Final paragraph sustains clarity and lifts resonance, staying within 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences are dense yet propulsive; no scaffold loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors (“sky mirrored within walls”) are stable and recharged at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. One near-purple line – “fractally precise renderings” – is repeated, but it is motif-anchored, not decorative, so the overwriting cap is not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is competent and clear; however, repeated scaffold phrases (“Eli’s fingers absently turned,” “Eli’s eyes wandered,” “Eli’s heart swelled”) create template cadence that slows momentum. Figurative language is sparse and safe, producing neither clarity gains nor texture risks.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the rhythm of repair” repeats three times) and one mixed register (“conceptual repricing” idea overstated). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image neatly. No figurative muddle or density glut; momentum breathes with scene needs. One paraphrase loop adjacent to epiphany costs a fractional notch.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sentences flow cleanly without scaffold loops, but metaphor density is high and generic—“kaleidoscope of colorful creatures,” “beacon of hope”—without pattern payoff. Some phrasing drifts toward brochure prose (“lush trees and vibrant flowers,” “truly special”). Opening and closing lines are smooth; middle paragraphs sag under repeated uplift cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dusk; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“pane of hush” taught early, paid off in shimmering closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: “the adjuster’s task… the adjuster’s actions…” repetition (−0.2) but does not dull closure image. High density: single sentences fuse light, emotion, mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is trim: no scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Some template cadence (“As she…, the…” opener repeats), but not dense enough to dull closure. Information density is moderate; sentences usually do one job. A few adjectival softeners (“soft, ethereal light”) could be sharper, yet clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary. Occasional lofted diction (“symphonically minded,” “poignant reminder”) edges toward editorial rather than experiential. One paraphrase loop: “patterns of foam… intricate networks of fibers… not unlike the complex structures” compressible without loss. Metaphors stay consistent (braid, chrysalis) and do not tangle; no mixed vehicles near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose reads aloud with floating, glass-bell rhythm; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Information density high—“quantifying absence” compresses an abstract method into four words without scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “glimmering parole…hidden pathways and secret narratives” restates the same idea; minor. Metaphors cohere under light/glass/cloud domain; no mixed vehicles. Closing line crystallizes earlier motifs without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with sentence-length variance and purposeful paragraph breaks. Figurative language is dense—every sentence carries image—yet pattern is taught and coherent, escaping purple-prose penalty. One paraphrase loop: “memories swirling within her” echoes “memories that had been stored within the pavilion” within four lines (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffolding does not dull the final image, keeping the score in solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative language is dense—every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and sustains the fairy-tale texture, earning partial immunity. Occasional abstractions (“sense of timelessness”) pad rather than advance. No loops or scaffold artifacts; rhythm breathes with paragraph variety, but reliance on soft-focus diction slightly blunts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is fluent, occasionally gorgeous, but leans on abstract intensifiers (“inexplicable connection,” “otherworldly energy”) that blunt specificity. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (“memories… entangled… recollections… web of recollections”) creating micro-loops. Mixed metaphors (“helix-minded,” “synaptic plasticity”) are decorative, never grounded in tool-use or bodily consequence. No artifact touches closure, but the sustained loftiness flattens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, with high information density: “yellowed parchment crackled with age” does double duty for texture and stakes. One scaffold loop appears—“the mist swirled around her” twice in similar cadence—but it doesn’t obscure causality. Metaphors stay coherent; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet breathable; sentence length varies to mimic musical cadence. One micro-loop: “the sculptor’s fingers began to strum the strings they had woven between the trees” restates prior image. Metaphors stay coherent (silence as fabric to be rewoven). No artifact touches the closing image; momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is musical, with balanced cadence and sensory specificity. Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors—but density remains high throughout, risking monotony. Repetitive anaphora (“As…”) and abstract nouns (“sense of hope,” “weight of exile”) create slight scaffold drag. No paraphrase loops or template cadence touches the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphor density peaks only in final paragraph where the closure image justifies it. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances atmosphere or interior shift. Filter verbs appear sparingly and are voice-motivated. One mixed vehicle—“tapestry of understanding”—is forgivable amid sustained lyric control.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cut test passes. Figurative density peaks at bloom yet pattern is taught early, so −0.3 only. One scaffold loop: “cultivating serenity within motion” repeated 3× without fresh inflection. No mixed metaphors; diction stays inside POV lexicon. Final image line is crisp, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lean scaffolding; most sentences advance setting, character, or concept simultaneously. A few soft stems—“she felt,” “she noticed”—but they appear outside peak beats and don’t clog momentum. Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles) and serve imagery rather than self-display. Opening and closing lines carry satisfying sonic bookends without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: figurative language clusters only during the aurora surge, taught by context. One paraphrase loop (“soft glow… ethereal light”) costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines frame the arc with mirrored luminescence. Read-aloud rhythm breathes appropriately; paragraph cuts are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence rhythm mirrors breath of flute phrases; occasional stacked modifiers (“avalanchingly quiet”) risk purple but stay legible. One scaffold loop—“the silence… avalanchingly quiet” repeats concept not content—dulls without obscuring closure. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density: every sentence layers sensory, conceptual, or kinetic data. Some metaphor overlap—“swirling vortex,” “kaleidoscope,” “living thing” in one paragraph—creates minor purple swell but does not cloud closure. No loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors stake; final line crystallizes image. Minor tightening could delete one “energy” instance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with vivid noun-verb pairs—“unwound before her,” “ghostly presence.” Occasional elevated phrase—“germinate a sense of connection”—leans ornamental but recurs intentionally. No mixed metaphors or scaffold sentences; final line lands with echoic punch. Minor density in lyrical repeats prevents the 9-band but remains well above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lyrical overwrite clusters in almost every sentence (“heavy with the scent of damp earth,” “soft, muted sounds,” “glittering crystals and ancient energy”)—pattern is present but not taught or varied, so density fatigue sets in. Mixed metaphors (“anchor that kept her tethered even as her spirit soared”) create slight physics clash. No scaffold loops, but repetitive participle openers dull propulsion. Final image still clear, so cap stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is strong; figurative language is patterned (thread/puzzle/silence) rather than gratuitous. One mixed-metor risk: “raveling silence” vs “unraveling tapestry” flirts with contradiction but resolves as intentional paradox. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Occasional elevated adjectives (“susurrus”) fit lyrical register and are earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and mythic layers. Minor scaffold: “the air was filled with the sweet scent…” appears twice with only slight variation, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls the final beat. Metaphors stay coherent—silk “writhe like living things” aligns with later blade shimmer—no mixed vehicles. One tense slip: “I’d bartered” precedes “I carefully wrapped” without clear temporal seam, but causality remains intact. Overall momentum carries through 800 words without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud cadence is fluid, but repeated “she” stems and “as she…” scaffolding create template echoes that dull propulsion. Figurative layer is restrained, coherent. Density adequate; minor paraphrase loops (“she felt… she knew”) in final third cap rise above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; sentence variety supports the meditative pace. Minor loop: “luminescent ache” is repeated with near-identical phrasing three times; “stacking stones” cadence re-uses same participle opening. Metaphors stay coherent. No scaffolding or synonym churn in climax; clarity intact. Density is high; every sentence advances mood or image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally lean and image-dense, but suffers mild template cadence—“As she…, the stars…”—repeated three times, dulling propulsion. Figurative language is coherent—light as shard, dawn as coalescing reality—but never mixed or purple. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn obscure causality. One overwritten line—“the air was alive with an otherworldly energy”—is generic filler amid otherwise specific sensory detail; artifact stays below closure beat, so 9+ is not disallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, read-aloud melodic, with high information density: each sentence layers image or emotional nuance. No loops, no mixed metaphors; “quietly explosive” is the single compressed oxymoron and it pays off. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-anchored. Occasional adjective triads (“soft, ethereal glow”) flirt with purple but stay within voice. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.9)
    Overwriting clusters in the final third: “silver glow,” “gentle healing power,” “magic of the mundane miracles” repeat the same luminescent abstraction four times, dulling the closure image. Paraphrase loops appear (“the worker smiled, feeling… the worker smiled, feeling…”). Near-simultaneous participles (“As they walked… the sound… echoing”) create timeline fuzz. Metaphors are coherent but generic (“storm of the universe”). Information density is low; many sentences do only one job.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is fluid and vivid, but sentences often duplicate action (“she felt… she knew… she smiled”) creating mild paraphrase loops. Figurative language is steady; no mixed metaphors, yet density never modulates for pressure. Clean mechanics and proofreading.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rhythm modulates: calm descriptive lull builds to shorter clauses at midnight beat. Information density high—each sentence advances setting, character, or theme. Minor scaffold: “As the clock struck…As midnight drew near…As the first light…” creates template cadence but does not obscure closure. No mixed metaphors or overwriting; near-publishable with micro-edit.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and loop-free; figurative language is sparse so no metaphors muddle. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job; occasional filler (“the scent of blooming flowers and the soft murmur of conversation”) could be cut without loss. Strong read-aloud rhythm and consistent tense; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is loop-free, image-dense, and propulsive; each sentence layers archival texture without paraphrase. Occasional elevated lyric (“illusions… like the whispers of a forgotten lullaby”) risks soft density, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final mist image. Strong verbs—“etched,” “distilled,” “refracted”—carry weight; few adverbial props. No grammar slips or spatial contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    High density early—every sentence feeds image or tension; minor loop intrusions (“the air was heavy… the tension was palpable”) and two mixed metaphors dock 0.3. Closure line breathes cleanly, artifacts avoid the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is serviceable, but paragraph breaks fall at every beat, creating a staccato rather than propulsive swell.  Several sentences do double duty (taste sensing, ring vibration, aurora change), yet overall density is moderate; some phrases recycle “seemed to” and “as if” hedges that dilute immediacy.  Mixed metaphor check is clean; no strained vehicles.  Two paraphrase loops (“energy that was both ancient and futuristic” restated twice) dock −0.2.  No grammar or pronoun issues; typo-free.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence openings; information density is high. However, three near-adjacent “as if” constructions and two “seemed to” filters soften the climactic beat. One paraphrase loop: “weight…begin to lift, like the slow uncorking…” restates the prior sentence. No mixed metaphors, but the elevated register drifts slightly above the character’s grounded sensory idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences multi-task (world/character/atmosphere). Sparse figurative language avoids purple overload; one mixed moment—“misty rain continued to fall, a reminder of the world’s fragility, but also of its beauty”—teeters toward generic. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Proof clean except “wilts” used transitively for ink (acceptable poetic license).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is spare and purposeful, avoiding purple swell. High information density—each sentence advances image, time, or concept—gives the piece forward motion despite its meditative surface.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with high information density: each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are spare and integrated—“flames danced like living entities”—without metaphor pile-ups. One scaffold tic: “the desert rose farm, once again…” repeats three times as a paragraph opener, creating a template cadence that dulls the final beat. Otherwise, syntax breathes with the fire’s surge and ebb.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    Repeated abstract couplings—“the courtyard’s tranquility was disrupted… maintained”—create paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Stock phrasing (“inexplicable connection,” “sense of calm wash over her”) clusters in the closing beats, obscuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is controlled, but repeated abstract phrasing (“sense of mysterious familiarity,” “calm defiance”) creates scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors, yet density dips when emotional beats are told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences vary in length and opening; no scrambles of identical stems. Information density is high—each clause advances setting or interior pull. One paraphrase loop: “the soft glow…soft, blue light” reiterates luminescence without new pressure, but it does not touch the closure beat. Metaphors stay consistent within optic/gravity field; no mixed vehicles or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lyrical and sonically aware; sentence rhythms mimic the hush they describe. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only atmospheric work—but redundancy is limited; no synonym loops or scaffold phrases obscure beats. Metaphors stay coherent within the mythic register, though several are stacked (“tranquil blaze,” “terrestrially cosmic”) and verge on oxymoron without payoff. Because closure is an image rather than a causal hinge, the slight overwriting does not obscure meaning, but it keeps the line-level craft shy of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, varied, and read-aloud smooth; sentences pull double duty (e.g., “meteor shower above them cast a magical glow, as if the stars themselves were illuminating the secrets”). No loops, mixed metaphor, or scaffold. One paraphrase hiccup—“secrets they hold” repeats twice in adjacent lines—drops score a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, and read-aloud smooth. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and sustains the lyric mode. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only atmospheric work, trimming would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong sensory nouns/verbs (“aurora’s gentle light danced,” “stalactites dripped, slowly and silently”) keep momentum. No mixed metaphors; pearl twilight sustains consistent luminescent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear (“soft, gentle light” ×2 near rose thorn), −0.2. Register stable; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks. Final aurora image cleanly recharges motif, earning modest high-band entry despite minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Strong read-aloud cadence with varied sentence lengths; however, figurative chains (“reed-blown melancholy,” “webs of intrigue,” “labyrinthine canyons”) recur in adjacent lines without pattern payoff, creating decorative density. No scaffolding loops, but metaphor coherence frays near the climax where stacked abstractions blur tactile ground. Information density is high; momentum is musical rather than propulsive, acceptable under Accumulative lens but limiting top-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sentences breathe in long wave-like clauses that suit dream texture; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“broken shell,” “stars on a moonless night”) flirt with purple but remain legible. No loops or scaffold detected; pronoun and tense clean. Information density is moderate—some sentences perform only atmospheric work—preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, loop-free, with vivid sensory nouns (lapping, lattices, lanterns). Occasional elevated adjective stacks (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with purple but stay purposeful to her character. No scaffold or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stance. Final paragraph repeats “hidden patterns” twice—minor paraphrase loop, not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clear and mostly concise; no loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional scaffold stems (“As she walked…”) and adverbial openers dull momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve adequately. No artifact touches the final beat, but density is only moderate; many sentences do one job.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relentless modifier chains (“stormlit observatory,” “cobalt glass portico,” “gritty whimsy”) create density without propulsion—metaphor vehicles repeat conceptually. Filter-verb stacks (“she began to sense,” “she began to unfold”) dull immediacy. Paragraph breaks follow identical summary beats, producing drum-beat rhythm. Closure line (“legacy lived on, a beacon of hope”) is pure stock phrasing, no image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variation, and concrete nouns outweigh sporadic softeners (“weight of his years”). Mixed metaphor cluster limited to two lines near midpoint; no template cadence in closure. Information density high—each paragraph advances image or stake. Minor scaffold: “the poet’s thoughts turned…” refrain thrice; not severe enough to dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: information-dense lines advance atmosphere and action simultaneously; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she could feel,” “seemed to”) dilute immediacy; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift—clean enough for high-band though syllabic richness borders on purple during peak tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm is steady, but sentence openings default to “The mapper / She / As” stems that dull propulsion. Figurative language is sparse and clean, yet information density is low: repeated snow/ice/moon descriptors pad without new pressure. No scaffolding loops obstruct clarity, but no line-level sparkle either.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong auditory and olfactory specificity, but “dripping water continued to reverberate” loops four times near verbatim—template cadence −0.4. Mixed metaphor cluster in para 3: “threads of entangled memories…weight of the past” compresses without fresh image. Elsewhere clean, concise, propellant. No closure-beat artifacts, so 9-bar remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is clean but leans on abstract nouns (“solace,” “renewal,” “redemption”) where concrete bodily reaction would sharpen. Several sentences open with participial phrases in succession, creating faint template cadence. No mixed metaphors or loops obscure causality, yet information density is moderate rather than compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high; most sentences layer image with concept. Recurrent template cadence (“With each new discovery…,” “As the workshop evolved…”) and paraphrase loops (“Zephyr’s understanding… expanded,” “Zephyr’s findings influenced…”) create micro-drag; these loops do not touch the final line but cumulatively dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean yet textured, with purposeful repetition of “echo,” “void,” and “numbers” creating incantatory momentum. No loops or scaffold detected; figurative layers (“digital detritus,” “ghostly signature”) remain coherent and do not stall the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry double duty: “glint of crystal nestled in roots” shows action + setting. Mixed metaphors avoided; “shattered essence” is single coherent image. Occasional elevated diction—“reconstitute,” “conceptual repricing” risk—kept within guardian’s reflective lexicon. One paraphrase loop spotted: “whispers of the frozen sea” echoed twice; mild –0.2. Final line propels: landscape sighs, reader released. 8.1 not higher because density dips slightly during mirror montage; filter verbs (“she began to move”) could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with strong read-aloud cadence and varied paragraph shape. Occasional template cadence (“As I…, I felt…”) recurs every few sentences, dulling momentum; not severe enough to touch closure. Metaphors (“fold in patience”) remain coherent. Information density is high; minimal scaffold. Final third stays clean, keeping 9+ eligibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and image-dense, but repeated abstract nouns (“complexity,” “understanding,” “mismatches”) create synonym loops that dull momentum. No scaffolding or template cadence; metaphors stay coherent. A few filter phrases (“she felt,” “she realized”) could be trimmed for immediacy. Line-level craft is solid, yet the lyric surplus in the final third prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Line-level craft is fluid yet leans on abstract intensifiers (“gentle, soothing energy,” “deepen,” “resonate”) that dull tactile edge. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same sensation, creating micro-loops that slacken momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift, but the sustained soft-focus diction keeps the piece from high-band density.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical but restrained; no metaphor chains or purple overload. Information density is high—each sentence layers scent, color, sound, or emotional valence. Repetition is intentional (“As she walked…”) to create incantatory cadence; no synonym loops. Closing line is crisp, satisfying ear-test. Minor scaffold: “the dove gray map case” is repeated four times with identical epithet; trims −0.2. Still, clarity and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence layers atmosphere or character. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “staccato rhythm” is apt, not cliché. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes resolve through crystal glow. High information density achieved without overwriting; punctuation and tense immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary with occasional poetic inversion. Figurative language is restrained—tendrils, heartbeat—avoiding purple drift. A few scaffold phrases echo (“the fog swirled… the fog closed”) but they serve accumulative pattern, not loop. Clarity stays high; no artifact touches the closure beat, satisfying the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluid, but repeated abstract noun phrases (“luminous ache,” “harness the ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”) create template cadence across paragraphs. No mixed metaphor, yet stacked abstractions dull the final image. One paraphrase loop: “still connected… still alive… still… wonder” within four lines. Density adequate; trimming 10% would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud pleasant, but suffers from gentle loop syndrome: “soft,” “gentle,” “pulsing stillness” recur in adjacent lines without accruing new pressure. Metaphors are consistent (music = fragrance = light) yet sometimes mix—can “humming” also “cradle”? Clause rhythms grow lullingly uniform, risking monotony. No line-level artifact obscures causality, but the cadence is cushiony rather than propulsive, keeping it above midpoint but below elite density.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and fluid, with modest variety; occasional scaffold appears (“the path to understanding lay…”). No metaphors muddle, yet information density is moderate—several sentences repeat the same beat in new wrappers. Loops are minor and do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    Read-aloud rhythm is pleasant, yet sentences open repeatedly with “As she… / She had…” creating template cadence (−0.4).  Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors, but no high-density payoff either.  Paragraph cuts are logical; no scaffolding paragraphs found.  Line clarity high; pronoun reference clean, tense stable.  Lacks the snap and compression expected at elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is almost loop-free; only “soft luminescence” repeats twice and is forgiven as motif reinforcement. Metaphors (pearl, bloom, zephyr) cohere around light-botanical axis without mixed logic. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or action. Rhythm breathes naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. A single paraphrase loop (“the star watcher’s presence seemed to embody…”) keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical, and readable, but leans on abstract qualifiers (“serene,” “soothing silence,” “gentle transformation”) that cushion rather than sharpen. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops, yet information density is moderate; several sentences could lose “quietly,” “soft,” “slowly” without harm. Final image lands clearly, so artifacts stay below closure-damage threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean, but “ swirling hush of words” and “sense of peace settle over her” are semi-stock clusters; no mixed metaphor, yet cadence approaches mantra. Scaffold is light—few paraphrase loops; information density adequate. Final paragraph piles abstract positives (“gratitude,” “completion,” “peace”) without fresh image, dulling the landing beat. Grammar and tense consistent; paragraphing purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is musical but leans on template cadence (“As the…”, “The…”) that creates drum-beat rhythm; several near-repeats (“sense of longing… sense of community”) dull density; figurative layering is coherent but peaks in passive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with prepositional, participial, and subject-start patterns without drumbeat. No loops or synonym churn; “stillness” is repeated but reweighted intentionally. Figurative density spikes in the final third (“vessels for the deepest desires,” “cartographer of the soul”) yet stays coherent under the lyric lens. Strong verbs anchor motion; only minor scaffold in “seemed to glow / seemed to come alive” doublet.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density: one sentence often does setting, metaphor, and interior tilt (“air heavy with…decay, a reminder that the season was indeed wounded”). No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opener. Figurative layer is thin enough to avoid muddle; metaphors are lock-craft specific. A single template cadence appears—“As he…”—three times, but pattern serves hypnotic accumulative lens, therefore waived. Final line lands with tactile snap.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings; only two scaffold phrases (“With each step,” “As the night wore on”). Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. Density is high but not purple; each line advances atmosphere or motion. Filter verbs minimal; no simultaneity errors. Final paragraph approaches loop: “testament to…depth of her understanding” echoes earlier phrasing, but impact is softened, not obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lyrical yet lean; sentences vary, no template cadence detected. Occasional softener (“seemed to”) slightly dulls peak beat; minor paraphrase loop on “sense of peace settle over her” repeated phrasing. Metaphors coherent (rust-hued peace) and kept in POV idiom. Opening and closing lines ear-tested; final sentence lands with hush.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; only minor paraphrase loops (“abandoned… abandonment”) and two instances of “began to” scaffolding. Figurative language stays sparse, so no density penalty. Sentence variety is good, paragraph cuts clean. Opening and closing images anchor the arc. A few filler modifiers (“soft glow,” “gentle hiss”) could be traded for stronger nouns, keeping score just above mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; scaffolding largely excised. Some metaphor layering (“crystal whispering forecourt,” “glacial hush”) borders on decorative density but supports accumulative lens. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. Final line earns cadence cut. Typo-free; punctuation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is compressed and image-rich; most sentences carry double duty (setting + interiority or action). A few metaphor stacks—“warm orange glow,” “weight of history settle”—border on familiar but do not break physical logic. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts test clean. Opening and closing images bracket the arc with mirror-light reciprocity, giving sonic closure. One mixed metaphor—“fabric of time bending”—minor; does not touch final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual ebb. Yet repeated abstract nouns (“mysteries,” “rhythms,” “secrets”) and soft verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) flatten propulsion. Several near-paraphrase pairs (“gentle lapping of waves” vs. “soft lapping of the waves”) dull density. No metaphor muddle, but no compression peaks either.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyric cadence occasionally drifts into template stacks—“the silence that echoed… like a mournful sigh,” “beauty that was both haunting and redemptive”—slight metaphor padding but retains clarity. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or interiority. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Read-aloud rhythm varies; minor over-modification in adjective pairs but not closure-damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraphing. Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is set early and sustains cohesion, so the lyric overload reads as stylistic commitment rather than artifact. A few soft repeats (“world was flawed… world was alive… world slowly coming alive”) create micro-loops that dull momentum. Overall, the prose is polished but not yet surgically lean.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, with purposeful paragraph breaks and varied sentence length. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors, but “kelp-drift peace” and “scars can sing” edge toward soft poeticism. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others summarize internal state. No loops or scaffold, but occasional filler filters (“she felt,” “she knew”) sap urgency in closure vicinity, preventing 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Figurative language is dense but patterned early (“stars bloomed like flowers”) and therefore tolerable under lyric mode. A few soft paraphrase loops (“intricate patterns,” “infinite beauty”) recur without new pressure. No mixed metaphors or register drift; punctuation clean. Momentum is leisurely, appropriate to contemplative tone; no scaffold sentences. Closure line is crisp, saving it from artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is clean, loop-free; clauses breathe with scene temperature. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) fits ceremonial tone. No mixed metaphors, though “thundering calm” borders oxymoron it intentionally tensions tone. Information density drops mid-story during reflective blocks; sentences list rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhythm breathes with the pendulum, sentences lengthen/contract purposefully. One scaffold detected: “the weight… slowly lifting” is restated in adjacent phrasing, a −0.2 loop. Metaphors are coherent (pendulum as heartbeat) and do not clog high-pressure beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, scaffold-free, high-density; no filter-verb clusters or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay internally consistent (stars as map, darkness as blanket) and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Minor overwrought phrases—“uncharted echoes,” “velveteen gloom”—tip toward preciousness but remain limited; they do not touch closure. Overall read-aloud rhythm is confident, with purposeful paragraph cuts that advance image or knowledge every two to three sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sentence rhythm varies and read-aloud flow is pleasing, but metaphor density clusters in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching, dulling the peak moment. Several near-repetitions (“ poised to make its mark… pen hovered, still, poised”) create paraphrase loops. Information density is high, yet the overwriting check applies: figurative layering obscures the causality of ink finally meeting ice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluent and rhythmic, but overindulges in metaphor strings: every sentence in the first third carries a figurative vehicle, dulling impact. Mixed metaphor risk—“radio dial’s secretly luminous face seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy”—is borderline. Paraphrase loops appear (“mist-shrouded atmosphere,” “mist outside the alcove swirled”). No artifact touches closure, so high-band cap remains 8.8; density surplus holds score here.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density: each sentence layers motif or stakes; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained; mixed-metaphor risk avoided. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Final line anchors closure without overwriting. Minor participle simultaneity (“eyes appear to hold…”) but no clarity break.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is rhythmically controlled: long sentences堆叠to mimic obsessive recursion, then snap to short fragments (“He would preserve…”) at closure. Loop check reveals two near-paraphrase clusters—“competing narratives” thrice, “rationally rebellious” twice—costing −0.3. Metaphors stay coherent (rot, sediment, time). No scaffold sentences; information density is high. Final line lands cleanly without clutter, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence rhythm is varied; however, stacked abstract nouns (“yearning,” “longing,” “harmony,” “stillness”) create synonym churn that blurs specificity. Several sentences open with participial or prepositional clauses, softening propulsion. No hard artifacts in closure beat, but figurative layering feels ornamental rather than tactical. Read-aloud ear is pleasant but slightly hypnotic—risk of monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lean and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are kept physical (“metal beams corroded by time”) and mutually coherent. One mixed image whispers—“the very fabric of time was being rewoven”—but it lands in a low-pressure beat and does not tangle closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line returns to sprout as living ellipsis, supplying cadence closure. High-band minus hairline for that single fabric/time weave.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, with varied sentence length and no scaffold loops. Occasional soft fillers—“with a hint of curiosity,” “mesmerized by”—reduce density without obscuring causality. Metaphors are spare and coherent; no overwriting in the climax. A few more precise verbs could lift momentum further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Some scaffold shows up (“She had always been drawn… She had long been driven…”) creating template cadence, but it never obscures causality. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. A few filter verbs weaken immediacy, yet information density is decent and no loops clutter the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid and image-rich, but figurative language clusters in successive sentences (“cascade of revelations,” “thread together the fragments”) create light pattern density without new pressure. A few paraphrase loops—“the garden, once forgotten, was now a vibrant, thriving ecosystem” restates prior beats. Overall clarity and rhythm remain intact; no artifact touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—moon as lantern, smog as star-thief—taught early and paid off at dawn. One paraphrase loop: “the city’s din and pollution seemed to recede” echoed twice; minor. No mixed metaphors; closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and concise; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and apt (“rosewater dread”). Information density is high—each sentence advances image or lore. A few adjective clusters (“exquisite opera glass,” “delicate, bread-shaped sculptures”) flirt with prettiness but do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Paragraph rhythm breathes—short bursts for descent, longer roll for glow reveal. Metaphors (“wind whipping hair into a frenzy”) are familiar but serviceable; no mixed vehicular crashes. Recurrent “neatly inventive mind” becomes template cadence; synonym churn around “mysterious” and “ancient” weakens diction. No scaffold obscures causality; clarity holds to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Rhythm is steady but template-like: many “I [verb]ed, and…” openings; three adjacent sentences start “The whispering advisor’s voice…” near climax. Figurative language is serviceable but occasionally mixed (“vortex” of luminance). No mechanical errors, yet information density dips in corridor wandering. Scaffolding phrases (“it was then that,” “as I did”) pad immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rhythm is supple, with sentence length and paragraph breaks echoing the swells of music. Figurative language is dense but patterned, taught early and sustained. A few near-adjacent restatements (“the prophet’s music had become one with the atmosphere… restless euphony”) create micro-loop drag. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding obscure causality, so the line-level craft is strong though not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence rhythm varies; openings avoid mechanical repetition. Information density is moderate—some sentences do double duty, others glide on atmospheric filler (“the city still held secrets”). Metaphors are coherent but familiar (“sun beat down,” “shiver run down her spine”). No mixed vehicles or register drift. Minor scaffold: “she walked” repeats three times in close succession; paraphrase loops absent. Closing image is crisp, propulsive, and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths breathe. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest of history”) fits mood but edges toward purple. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing sentences anchor and resolve cleanly. Minor paraphrase within paragraphs (“faded signs and rusting ticket booths”) but not adjacent duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: selective sensory detail, no synonym loops, strong verbs ("wrest," "swallowed"). Occasional stacked modifiers ("stoically sensitive to the whispers") flirt with purple, yet the read-aloud cadence holds. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density high—each sentence advances stillness, decoding, or stamp motif. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“dappled resolve”) is mild; doesn’t touch closure. Clean grammar, precise punctuation. Final line anchors image and recharges ink motif. Minor over-modifying (“tranquilly perceptive”) but within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but disciplined: metaphor chains serve the luminous torment tone; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop—“something tangible, something that could be shaped and molded”—redundant, costs −0.2. Otherwise density is high; each sentence layers craft, body, emotion. Final paragraph avoids figurative muddle; image of unfolding lotus lands clean. A trim of two adjectives per paragraph would sharpen propulsion to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    Information density is adequate; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. However, stacked abstract noun phrases (“sense of purpose,” “bleak exhilaration”) flatten peak beats. Metaphors are safe (“beacon,” “tempered like crystal”) and do not muddle causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and advance steadily. Occasional soft fillers—“sense of anticipation,” “soft whisper of the wind”—but no mixed metaphors or register clashes. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. Final paragraph repeats “brilliant dimness” without fresh inflection, a minor cadence stall that keeps the score from 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentence rhythm varies; paragraphs echo wave-like ebb. Some adjective stacking (“serene gloom,” “melancholy haven”) edges purple but stays within atmospheric license. No scaffold loops or paraphrase clutter. Occasional abstraction weighs beats (“weight of unspoken words”) without concrete tether. Closure image clean, uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean but leans on iterative mist/wind phrasing (“mist swirling” appears 4×). No mixed metaphors; moon symbolism stays consistent. Paragraph cuts are purposeful, each advancing image or beat. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif. Minor scaffold: “weight of” construction repeats; does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth, but paraphrase loops abound: “navigate the present,” “find a way forward,” “one stroke at a time” recur with near-identical wording. Metaphors stack sentence-to-sentence without pattern teaching, creating soft purple patches. Opening and closing lines trade in stock uplift phrasing. No single sentence fails, yet cumulative template cadence dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence openings vary. Figurative language leans atmospheric but stays coherent—no mixed metaphors. However, several near-duplicate phrases (“bioluminescent glow,” “otherworldly light”) and scaffold sentences (“As she walked…”) create mild paraphrase loops. Information density is moderate; some sentences do only one job. No artifacts touch the closing image, so penalties stay minor.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely clean: no paraphrase loops, no template cadence, mixed metaphors absent. Occasional soft modifiers (“tiny lanterns,” “strange sensation”) could be sharper, yet they do not blur causality. Sentences advance atmosphere or knowledge; paragraph cut test passes. Opening and final lines are image-anchored. A few adjectival clusters (“cosmic intimacy,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) flirt with overwriting but stay within readable lyric density and do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and musical—“ethereal glow,” “choking beauty,” “trail of cloudbound memories”—yet avoids purple overload by staying short. One paraphrase loop: “lost time accumulates… moments that slipped away” in adjacent sentences (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ozone/earth/crack imagery coheres. Read-aloud rhythm varies; final sentence lengthens for cadence release. Artifacts stay minor and clear of closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, lyrical, loop-free; sentence length modulates to mimic breath of sewing. No scaffold, no metaphor muddle. Occasional elevated phrases—“uncharted possibilities,” “indomitable will”—flare slightly above grounded lexis but do not stall momentum. Final line lands with image, not explanation, satisfying read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentences vary in length; sonic repetition of “whispering hush” is deliberate pattern, not artifact. Some elevated phrasing (“texture of transformation,” “celestial bodies”) edges toward pseudo-profundity but stays consistent with tone. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening and closing lines anchor mood cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Clean, readable prose with mild poetic inflation (“inky darkness,” “otherworldly glow”) that never clouds causality. Repetitive scaffolding: four consecutive sentences beginning “As the…” in the final paragraph; “the sentinel” is named eight times in eleven sentences. No mixed metaphors or register drift, yet the cadence grows lullaby-monotonous. Density is moderate; clarity is high; momentum sags under ceremonial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional elevated register (“sacred patterns that governed the universe”) edges toward template cadence but stops short of clutter. No mixed metaphors. Final image is clear. High-band gate remains open; one near-repeat phrase keeps it from 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Syntactic variety is strong, but overwritten metaphor density in peak beats (“chorus of the damned,” “turbulence within”) tips toward purple. Minor paraphrase loops: “hidden patterns / unseen lines” restate without deepening. Opening and final lines are ear-tested and propulsive. No scaffold or template cadence, but figurative overload slightly blurs closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is clean, free of loops or scaffolding; sentence openings vary, and no mixed metaphors blur sense. Information density is moderate: some sentences do double duty, others drift into ornamental abstraction (“dignified chaos that was both beautiful and intense”). Overwriting check: figurative language clusters in the duel paragraph but stays coherent. Final paragraph relaxes into generic uplift; lacks a charged, image-driven kicker.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary. Figurative layering is dense but patterned (moon/rust/light) and supports texture—does not obscure causality. Two paraphrase loops (“the poet’s thoughts turned…”) and one filter-verb cluster cost −0.4. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors in closure beat; ending image is clean. High density, but poetic repetition approaches artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative density is high; mixed metaphors (“vortex of sound,” “tidal arbor”) risk purple overload yet serve lyric mode. Paraphrase loops are absent, but template cadence appears (“the pianist…”) and is justified by circular structure. Closure image is clear, but earlier stacks of adjectival mist slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.5)
    Repetitive anaphora (“As she…”) and stacked soft-focus metaphors (“tender shoots like tentative fingers”) create a lull rather than propulsion. No sentence-level hazard appears, but the hypnotic cadence dulls the climax instead of sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, scaffold-free, with high tactile density (“wet earth scent,” “delicate lace thread” doing double duty). No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor is spare and consistent (cerulean regret, tides of memory). Occasional soft filler (“began to ponder”) is minor; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but overuses figurative language without pattern payoff (“iridescent powder,” “intricate web,” “gentle presence”). Repetitive phrasing (“gradual change,” “accumulated dust patterns”) creates synonym loops. Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“state of becoming,” “quiet, incremental steps”) that dull closure impact. High information density is offset by lyrical redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Repetitive phrasing (“patterns,” “resonance,” “stillness”) and conceptual redundancy weaken propulsion—e.g., “the stillness of the canyon, the beauty of the frost, and the secrets of the ledger strip all blended together” restates prior ideas without advancing tension. Elevated diction (“drifting resonance,” “ethereal light”) occasionally clashes with the grounded premise. Final paragraph suffers from paraphrase loops and stacked abstractions that dilute the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“beauty preserved like a delicate flower in ice”). Minor redundancy in describing the heat-map’s glow and readings. Sentence openings vary effectively, though “The survivor...” begins three paragraphs, creating slight template cadence. No fatal artifacts, but figurative density in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally polished but exhibits scaffold loops: “the undertaker felt… the undertaker’s thoughts drifted… the undertaker set out…” creates rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, phrases like “occupy the impossible space” recur without evolving mechanics, leaning on abstraction. The closure beat (“smiled, his eyes closing in contentment”) risks sentimentality but is salvaged by contextual weight. Minor redundancy in describing the signal’s shift dulls propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but exhibits mild overwriting: repetitive phrasing (“gently persistent,” “collective efforts”), stacked modifiers (“warm orange glow,” “soft rustle of leaves”), and summary-heavy beats (“worked tirelessly to establish”). The final paragraph loops emotionally (“hope,” “renewed,” “face whatever”) without new pressure. Sentence variety is adequate, but cadence becomes predictable in reflective passages. No fatal artifacts, but density dips in mid-story exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: “ethereal light,” “mystical ambiance,” “otherworldly energy” recur without grounding. Minor paraphrase loops (“blossoms seemed to glow… unfurl like tiny stars… whisper a benediction”) dilute propulsion. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without payoff, risking purple prose. Still, sentence variety and sensory layering maintain momentum, though tighter editing would elevate clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“disorienting, yet exhilarating… metaphysical odyssey”), and figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching (“quaking reverie,” “rewoven fabric of reality”). Mixed metaphors (“fading photograph… reconstituted”) create minor coherence issues. Sentence openings vary, but template cadence appears in the middle (“As they… As they… As they…”). Momentum stalls during reflective blocks that summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrasing (“the liberator knew,” “seeds of…”) creates paraphrase loops; adjacent sentences often restate stakes (“hope,” “resilience”) without added pressure. Figurative density peaks in low-tension beats (e.g., “sugar and smoke wafted”) but evaporates during critical action, which is summarized. Final paragraph’s cadence mimics template inspirational prose, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally overwrites: “cells divided and the night wore on” feels biologically decorative, and “battered marvel” repeats without deepening. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without payoff pattern, risking purple prose. Sentence variety sustains momentum, and concrete verbs (“tinkered,” “imprinted,” “shattering”) anchor abstractions. Final paragraph’s “joyful cacophony” slightly undermines earlier tonal gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light,” “quietly savvy air”), repetitive phrasing (“fleeting golden sunset” appears twice), and near-synonym loops (“capture,” “preserve,” “reinterpret”). Figurative density blurs clarity in peak beats—e.g., “fabric of reality was being rewoven” adds no causal weight. Final paragraph repeats opening motifs without propulsion, creating scaffold-like redundancy that dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: figurative density in nearly every sentence (“morbid perfume that clung… like a damp shroud,” “weighty lightness”) creates texture without propulsion. Paraphrase loops abound—e.g., “thawing heart” appears four times with near-identical phrasing. The final third stacks abstract affirmations (“hope, renewal, weighty lightness”) that dull closure impact. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory without serving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose suffers from repetitive stems (“I was… I felt… I had…”) and paraphrase loops (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive,” “vulnerability is power” restated across paragraphs). Elevated diction (“reconfigures meaning,” “resonant reconfiguration”) clashes with the stunt double’s implied vernacular. The phrase “trembling certainty” is evocative but isolated; elsewhere, modifiers like “soft, soothing hum” or “death-defying stunts” lean generic. Final paragraph’s cadence swells artificially without earned syntactic buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors like “words dripped like honey” and “darkness so profound it seemed to have a texture” verge on purple in high-density passages. Adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“shadows deepening into pools of blackness… shadows seemed to swirl like living things”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density in the climax risks muddling causality. No loops or scaffold severely harm closure, but minor redundancy prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“remarkably composed” repeated 5x), synonym churn (“serene,” “tranquil,” “peace”), and template cadence (“As… Zeta…” openings). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion: every other sentence contains metaphor without pattern payoff. Final third drowns in redundant abstractions (“mystical atmosphere,” “deeper understanding”), dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive stems (“The registrar…”, “She…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “mistrust and secrecy melting away” appears three times with minor variation). Figurative density is high but incoherent—“resonant hush” is used four times without evolving meaning. Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“transparency,” “honesty reigned,” “guardian”) that dull momentum. No sentence-level propulsion; rhythm stagnates in meditative stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“the dresser would…”, “the garden’s beauty…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “devotion that bordered on reverence” followed by “reverence” in marble-polishing). Figurative density is high but often decorative rather than propulsive—metaphors accumulate without advancing causality. The final paragraph contains stacked abstractions (“testament to their craft,” “language of petals and leaves”) that dull closure impact through redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting plagues key beats: “kaleidoscope of colors and lights,” “liquid fire,” “ethereal glow” stack modifiers without advancing clarity. Repetitive phrasing (“felt a sense of…”) and paraphrase loops (“bathed in… glow,” “bathed in… radiance”) dull momentum. The climax suffers from figurative density without payoff—“sideways through time” is never concretized. Final paragraphs summarize revelation instead of dramatizing its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “music seemed to seep from the very walls” and “surreal narrative” verge on purple. Minor redundancy appears (“flickered, casting eerie shadows” / “flickered, casting an otherworldly glow”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, figurative density in peak beats slightly muddles causality—how exactly does water reveal the code? The mechanics remain poetic rather than legible, costing clarity at a crucial juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often evocative but over-relies on figurative density: “auroral sorrow,” “palimpsest of insights,” “swallowed truth” recur with diminishing returns. Paraphrase loops appear (“certainties were swayed,” “fragile balance,” “provisional and ephemeral”) and template cadence surfaces in middle paragraphs (“As she... As she...”). Final third avoids major artifacts, but elevated diction occasionally clashes with grounded setting. Information density is high, yet some lines summarize rather than dramatize pivotal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is competent but marred by paraphrase loops (“the explorer felt… the explorer’s eyes… the explorer’s gaze”) and stock metaphors (“morbid perfume,” “thread of curiosity”). Sentences often summarize rather than propel (“They were searching for something…”). Figurative density spikes without payoff in high-pressure beats, and the closure paragraph repeats “clarity” and “truth” without fresh specificity. Momentum stalls in reflective blocks that lack micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “whispers of forgotten lore” and “regenerative silence” verge on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“drift of untold seasons” repeated; “steadfast… amidst the flux” echoed). Sentence openings vary well, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern payoff. Final paragraph tightens effectively, though.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished but over-ornamented: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (eclipse climax), creating density without propulsion. Phrases like “hush of dreaming roots” and “threads of evening’s tranquility” repeat textural motifs without deepening stakes. Minor paraphrase loops (“sense of connection and belonging” / “linked him to something deeper”) dull immediacy. Closure image is clear, but line-level lushness occasionally obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    Repetitive phrasing (“fragment of the tapestry,” “bronze quiet,” “whispers of the past”) creates synonym loops. Figurative density is high but often decorative (“walls bearing scars of time,” “fabric... alive”) without advancing causality. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea (e.g., Emilia’s attunement described three ways in opening). Final paragraph’s “dragons seemed to stir” echoes earlier description without deepening—static lyricism stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    Prose suffers from severe overwriting: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“orchestrate the meeting” / “directing the flow of words”), figurative density overwhelms clarity (“words dripped with an air of mystery”), and template cadence dominates (“The Oracle’s… as they…” x4). Synonym churn (“mysterious,” “cryptic,” “enigma,” “puzzle”) and label-only interiority (“accidentally prophetic nature stirred”) create scaffold loops that dull momentum and obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive conceptual loops: “unravel the stillness” appears three times; “silence” is described as “decorated,” “presence,” “palpable force,” “muffled clarity”—synonym churn without progression. Mixed metaphors abound (“plumb the depths” vs. “decorate with silence” vs. “artist’s palette”). The final paragraph summarizes resolution rather than dramatizing it, dulling closure impact. Elevated register persists even in peak beats, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrought: figurative density appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (“chronologically homesick aura,” “upturned hush,” “symmetry that seemed to beckon”). Mixed metaphor logic emerges—the nautilus “pulses with rhythmic energy” like a heart, yet also symbolizes journey, without causal integration. Template cadence appears in repetitive structures (“As the…, the writer…”). Closure beat is clear, but artifacts reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: metaphors multiply without coherence (“fractured timelines,” “labyrinth of self,” “procedural generation” clash conceptually). Paraphrase loops appear (“transformed by her journey… stood transformed”; “reshaped… remade… realigned”). Register drift occurs in climax (“figure of darkening brightness” reads as academic jargon). Final paragraph stacks abstractions (“destiny,” “possibilities,” “coalescing darkness”) that dull closure impact, violating the read-aloud ear test through syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but over-figured: metaphors (“mirrored hush,” “womb,” “filament”) appear in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without payoff, creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops occur (“enthrall the space… enthralling the cavern”), and “audibly muted” / “world of vibrations and silence” repeat conceptually. Final paragraph’s “rustle of turning seasons” echoes opening redundantly without new pressure. Despite strong rhythm, scaffolded lyricism dulls causal momentum and blurs closure focus.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“As she...”, “The... seemed to...”) and paraphrase loops (“solace,” “tranquility,” “stillness” restated across paragraphs). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats (“shadows stretched and twisted,” “darkness receded”) but thins during supposed crisis. Overuse of abstract nouns (“integrity,” “possibilities,” “clarity”) replaces concrete action. Final third contains scaffold phrases (“newfound sense of purpose,” “ready to face whatever lay ahead”) that dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“fading light”/“fading ultraviolet light”), synonym churn (“wistful,” “nostalgia,” “longing”), and paraphrase loops (e.g., “sense of wonder” → “sense of awe” → “sense of peace”). Figurative density overwhelms key beats: “crystal shadows,” “otherworldly glow,” and “pulse with newfound vitality” stack modifiers without clarifying stakes. Final paragraph’s “lessons of the greenhouse” abstracts the climax into vague assertion. Sentence openings vary, but cadence falters in reflective passages with templated constructions (“As... Elara felt...”).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“uncovering layers, revealing truths, and discovering the texture of time” appears verbatim twice) and near-duplicate clauses (“The world, once fixed...” / “The world, reborn...”). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled (“texture of time” used as both metaphor and literal sensation). Final paragraphs loop conceptually without propulsion. These artifacts dull closure impact, preventing higher scoring despite strong individual lines.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often lyrical but overuses figurative language in high-pressure beats (“branches like withered fingers,” “morbid perfume,” “music wove together with stories”), creating density without propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops: “chronic hush” repeated five times with diminishing returns; “beauty in the unfinished” restated rather than dramatized. Final paragraph suffers scaffold phrasing (“celestial map guiding her,” “transformative power of art”) that dulls closure’s emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “intricate dance of molecules” or “tapestry of feeling” verge on purple without grounding in concrete action. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“emotions that were real enough… yet not so real”; “crafted feelings with precision… navigate the complex landscape”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes well, and imagery is cohesive—but figurative density in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but near-duplicates reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is competent but padded with summary (“Lena felt a desire…”, “Their conversation flowed…”). Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“poignant reminder… cycles of compassion”). Figurative language is sparse but safe; no mixed metaphors, yet no line-level propulsion. Final paragraph repeats “friendship… flourished” without fresh imagery—closure image is stated, not sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-reliant on figurative density: “glimmering obsidian arbor,” “luminescent ache,” “webs of kinship” recur as conceptual anchors without concrete grounding. Adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“Kael felt a deep longing to belong… To graft oneself onto a community was a desire that burned”) creating mild redundancy. Rhythm flows well, but elevated diction occasionally clashes with the need for visceral immediacy, especially in high-emotion beats where abstraction replaces sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely polished but contains subtle overwriting: “sculpts time itself by an invisible hand” mixes metaphors (sculpting vs. weaving), and “borrow fragments of the giant's time” leans abstract. Minor redundancy in describing the pendant’s glow twice. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with scene needs. However, the phrase “interrupted cadence in the rhythm of the canal's flow” followed by “pause in the water's gentle song” verges on paraphrase-loop. Not fatal, but prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“weaving intricate patterns in the air,” “hidden topography”), slightly blurring immediacy. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent sentences restate the orchard’s transformation (still → promise), triggering a −0.2 paraphrase-loop deduction. Closure image remains sharp despite slight figurative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“sapphire hush,” “labyrinthine corridors”)—elevated diction slightly exceeds the dweller’s plausible lexicon. Minor scaffold: “a kindly methodical soul” appears twice as label. Otherwise, high information density; sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Final paragraph’s cadence effectively echoes opening, creating closure through rhythm. No syntactic monotony or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.3)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dull momentum: “transformation,” “metamorphosis,” “change,” “evolve,” “renewal” cycle interchangeably across adjacent lines. Template cadence appears in sequences like “Emilia felt… Emilia realized… Emilia understood…” Multiple sentences restate the same insight without added pressure (e.g., paragraphs 12–14). Figurative density peaks in low-stakes beats without payoff, and the final image (“symbol of her own journey”) lands as summary, not charged particular.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“crumbling buildings and overgrown streets” → “desolate and barren place”) and stock metaphors (“glimmered,” “dance across its surface”). Figurative density spikes in low-pressure beats but evaporates during key moments (the exchange), creating uneven rhythm. Final paragraph uses redundant stems (“secrets… mysteries… secrets”) and therapy-adjacent phrasing (“process the trauma”), dulling closure impact. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is fluid but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor (“threads of magic,” “bright darkness,” “eternal song”), creating a purple haze that dulls propulsion. Repetitive phrasing (“Aria realized… Aria found… Aria stood”) and near-synonym loops (“serene and enchanting,” “fierce and gentle”) reduce momentum. Final paragraph suffers from thematic echo, summarizing rather than crystallizing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic cadence (“The archivist...”, “The ivory harbor...”) and paraphrase loops (“fragments were coalescing,” “fragments, once scattered... transformed”). Overuse of figurative language (“beacon of hope,” “rich tapestry”) in high-pressure beats creates density without propulsion. Final paragraph stacks near-synonymous declarations (“testament,” “symbol,” “promise”) that dull closure impact. Strong opening line, but momentum stalls in mid-section exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“twisting corridors and alcoves… twisting passages”), synonym churn (“mysteries… secrets… hidden truths”), and template cadence (“As she walked… As she turned… As she stepped”). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats but evaporates during climax, leaving key turns under-dramatized. Mixed metaphors (“gateway to a realm,” “map revealing patterns”) dilute coherence. Final paragraph over-tells transformation (“mind transformed,” “newfound sense of purpose”) instead of showing through concrete image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is often lush and evocative, but suffers from overwriting: phrases like “alchemy of memory and imagination transformed the mundane into the sublime” verge on abstraction, and figurative density occasionally blurs clarity. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“entangled memories” repeated without deepening), and some sentences prioritize lyricism over propulsion. Still, rhythm generally serves atmosphere, and the final lines land with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “swirling colors that danced across the walls” followed by “colors surrounding Kael deepened” risks paraphrase-loop. Figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats (“pocket of reality that diverged from the norm”), but remains coherent. Sentence openings vary adequately; rhythm supports escalation. Minor redundancy in describing the amulet’s glow and energy surge slightly dulls propulsion, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is largely polished, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, but suffers from minor overwriting: phrases like “morbid beauty that suited her mood” and “deathly vitality” verge on purple. A paraphrase loop appears in the reflection on “mathematics of a fair trade,” restating the same abstract query across two sentences without added pressure. The ink pot description is repeated with diminishing returns. These artifacts don’t obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “kaleidoscope of sensations,” “intricate web of histories,” and “ethereal glow” verge on purple. Some redundancy appears (“capturing the subtleties of the hum, and the gentle vibrations of the forest” echoes earlier lines). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the scene’s pace. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., dawn climax) lacks payoff, and “incandescent restraint” is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“fragments,” “stories,” “labyrinth,” “tide” recur without functional evolution) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “erased histories… lost to the sands of time… deliberately erased”). Elevated diction (“morbid fascination,” “resonant reconfiguration”) clashes with the absence of concrete action. Final third contains scaffold sentences that summarize rather than dramatize climax.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is overwritten in high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the climax carries figurative language (“cacophony of sound that was both beautiful and terrifying,” “infused with the essence of the observatory”), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear (“resonant hums… weave a spell… draw her deeper… hums grew louder”), and the final paragraph repeats “whispers of the past” and “forsaken place” without added pressure, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“preserve the city… worth fighting for… worth preserving”) and synonym churn (“resistance,” “united front,” “fight for their home”). Figurative language is sparse but strained (“beacon of hope,” “enduring spirit”) without grounding in concrete action. Final third relies on abstract declarations (“power of collective action”) that dull closure impact. Sentence openings lack variety, and information density is low—many lines restate stakes without advancing plot or character.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“dawning hush” appears twice verbatim; “poignant reminder” used three times) and stacked modifiers (“delicate, almost translucent petals,” “soft, melancholic glow”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction, creating a static, museum-display effect. The closure beat is dulled by paraphrase loops: “fleeting beauty… transience of life… preciousness of life” recycles concepts without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; figurative language serves atmosphere and method. However, mild overwriting appears in high-density passages (“light refracted… became more vivid, more nuanced”), risking purple prose. No fatal loops or scaffold, but phrases like “beacon of industrious tranquility” border on abstraction. Final paragraph’s repetition of “mist-coated rail depot” feels slightly redundant, though it reinforces motif.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive scaffolding: “the silence was... punctuated only by...” appears twice; “snow crunched beneath her feet” recurs verbatim. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“growing sense of urgency” / “worrying sense of anticipation”). Figurative language is dense but generic (“stars twinkled like diamonds”). The final paragraph loops motifs without propulsion, dulling the closure image. High information density is offset by redundancy and cadence fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-figured (“velvet expanse,” “diamonds scattered,” “fabric of reality”), risking purple prose in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“rhythm... soothing melody... wild hush... rhythm... pattern... rhythm”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraphs breathe with visual rhythm. However, “infinitely patient” appears three times as a label rather than demonstrated behavior, and “wild hush” is repeated without evolution—small artifacts that dull immediacy slightly but don’t obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetitive phrasing (“lonesome splendor” appears three times; “gathered hush” twice; “time runs short” twice) creates paraphrase loops. Sentences often stack modifiers (“faint glow,” “crumbling stone,” “otherworldly power”) without advancing momentum. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff, risking purple prose. Final paragraph circles back without propulsion, relying on echo rather than intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from paraphrase loops (“seeking answers or escape” / “seeking to uncover the truth”) and repetitive conceptual phrasing (“thread the labyrinth with his own story” appears verbatim twice). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, key beats rely on summary (“felt a deep connection,” “mind was racing”) rather than dramatized perception. Sentence openings vary, but momentum stalls in mid-section due to redundant atmospheric assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: “lovingly venomous intent, a bittersweet mixture of sorrow and devotion” stacks abstractions without grounding. Repetitive stems (“the greenhouse… the greenhouse…”) and paraphrase loops (“resonant awakenings… secrets of resonant awakenings”) dull momentum. Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, closure beat suffers from summary (“debt slowly being repaid”) rather than dramatization. Sentence propulsion stalls in the final third with redundant thematic restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“carve a path from ruin to reverence” appears three times), synonym churn (“tapestry of hope,” “fabric of solace,” “fabric of reverence”), and stacked modifiers that blur focus. Figurative density is high but unvaried, creating a monotonous cadence. Key lines restate the same idea across adjacent sentences (e.g., dawn completion followed by redundant affirmations), dulling propulsion and closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“She... She... She...”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “uncovering the earth... uncovering secrets...”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, phrases like “untangling like the roots” verge on mixed metaphor. Final paragraph contains scaffolded restatement (“sense of pride... sense of faith... sense of cautious enchantment”), dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: phrases like “futuristic nostalgia,” “meditative flow,” and “pulsate with energy” verge on purple without grounding action. Adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“encoded message was a puzzle… designed to reveal deeper meaning” → “testament to skill and creativity”). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats, not climax, avoiding major muddle. Final paragraph loops motifs (arcade, journey, margins) without new propulsion, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive constructions (“as if...” appears four times) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “uncover secrets” / “unravel conspiracies” / “secrets revealed”). Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff—threads “shimmer,” chart “pulses,” flame “dances,” but these images don’t compound meaning. Final paragraph’s “universe itself were awakening” edges into abstraction, dulling closure’s tactile charge.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with imagery but occasionally over-ornamented: “twisted branches,” “ethereal voices,” “dappled shadows” verge on stock lyricism. A paraphrase loop occurs in describing Aria’s purpose (“sought to find the moment before deciding… hoped to uncover the truth…”). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve rhythm, but figurative language dominates high-pressure beats without sufficient grounding in concrete action. Final lines avoid moralizing, yet “fierce tenderness” reads as label-speak rather than embodied revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments without pattern payoff (“tangled threads,” “lotus-hearted ache,” “mist swirled on”). Paraphrase loops appear (“anxieties that lingered… anxieties begin to surface… shared anxieties”) and synonym churn (“unknot,” “unraveling,” “tease out”). Final third suffers from stacked abstractions that dull closure impact. Sentence rhythm lacks propulsion—lyric stasis replaces narrative momentum, violating the read-aloud ear test.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“kaleidoscope of light and shadow,” “haunting harmony”). Minor paraphrase loops exist: “forsaken place” appears twice; “edge of perception/reality” echoes redundantly. Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density peaks in the climax without pattern-teaching payoff. No fatal artifacts, but slight scaffold in the final paragraph (“testament to the power of creativity”) edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense with purpose: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent—sound waves “wash over her,” colors “pulse with inner light.” Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (“swirling vortex of noise and color,” “fabric of reality unraveling”), risking slight muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are effective. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though two adjacent lines near the climax repeat “sound waves” unnecessarily—a small redundancy that slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“message patterns,” “coded language,” “spark of defiance” repeated with near-synonym churn) and scaffolded abstractions (“enduring power of human creativity,” “unbreakable spirit”). Final paragraphs read like thematic bullet points restated in elevated diction, dulling momentum. Figurative language is frequent but rarely advances causality—e.g., “converging chaos of thoughts” is evocative but inert. Sentence variety exists, but propulsion stalls in reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: “reef-shadow joy,” “galaxy postcard,” “blossom armistice” read as coined phrases lacking grounded referents. Repetition weakens momentum—“centuries of longing” appears three times; “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” is stated verbatim twice. Mixed metaphor in “photosynthesize pain” clashes with biological logic. Final paragraph contains paraphrase loops (“continue to create… driven by… shyly unstoppable force”). These artifacts dull closure’s impact without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is highly polished with strong information density—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and figurative language is largely coherent. However, two adjacent sentences near the end paraphrase: “The glass orchids, the wind chime, and the caretaker herself were all bound together…” followed by “In this, they found a strange, melancholic beauty…”—a minor loop. Also, “foxglove regret” appears twice, bordering on motif repetition without deepening. No scaffold or purple prose, but these small redundancies prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: “symphonies of truth” and “fabric of reality altered” verge on purple abstraction. Minor redundancy in describing the ink well’s significance across three paragraphs. Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence. However, phrases like “tangled threads of meaning” and “web of commitments” flirt with mixed metaphor, slightly muddying the central conceit. Final lines land cleanly, though “scent of possibility” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“the building breathed… stones expanding and contracting”; “heart tremble… sense of belonging”) and stacked figurative language in high-pressure beats without payoff. Phrases like “symphony of purpose” and “distilled into this moment” verge on purple prose. The final third repeats “tremble,” “resolve,” and “harmony” without deepening, dulling momentum. Information density is low—many lines restate mood without advancing plot or character.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “delicate balance of her paper trails” and “essence of life distilled into fragile dance” verge on purple without advancing causality. A paraphrase loop appears in lines describing her history (“patchwork of truth and fabrication… woven together with precision”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but the final paragraph’s cadence flattens slightly with repetitive structure (“As… As… The…”). No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold reduces propulsion in reflective stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often lush but over-reliant on figurative density (“shattered light danced,” “colors bleeding like watercolors,” “fractured hush that vibrated”) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Adjacent sentences paraphrase stakes (“mysteries that surrounded me” → “secrets that lay hidden”). Register drift appears in peak beats (“featherly determined,” “reverberate with otherworldly energy”)—elevated diction clashes with childlike perspective. Closure beat avoids major artifacts, but mid-story loops dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.3)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: “forsaken place”/“forgotten facility,” “luminous respite” repeated 4×, “shadowseam wonder” 3×, “softly ingenious” 3×. Template cadence dominates (“As they…”, “The… grew…”, “Their… was…”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff. Closure beat dulled by redundant abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: “iridescent cave,” “crystalline structure,” “shimmering pools of light” risk purple density in early beats. However, rhythm varies effectively, and sentences advance atmosphere and character simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but “cheerful gloom” appears three times without deepening—borderline repetitive motif. Final paragraph’s cadence resonates, though “magic that lay just beneath the surface” verges on vague abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished and evocative but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing (“orchestrated serendipity” appears three times, “tidal rhythm” twice) and mild overwriting (“diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse”). Sentences often do double duty, yet momentum stalls in reflective blocks that summarize rather than dramatize. No major artifacts obscure causality, but synonym loops (“captivating performance,” “unforgettable experience,” “spell of enchantment”) dilute impact. Final lines echo opening without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often lush but overwrites key moments: “fluidity and darkness that seemed to embody the very essence of the night” typifies label-heavy abstraction. Adjacent sentences paraphrase (“dance became poetry… movements infused with grace”). Figurative density peaks without payoff—“swirling vortex of movement” lacks concrete physicality. Final paragraph repeats “magic,” “memory,” “light” without deepening, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence contains metaphor (“thousand tiny diamonds,” “intricate web,” “clear complexity”), creating a static, ornamental texture. Paraphrase loops abound—e.g., “hidden patterns and meanings” → “hidden language” → “intricate web of threads.” Final third repeats “commune,” “reveal,” “capture” without progression. High information density is offset by momentum drag from recursive abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“gentle purpose,” “gentle rhythm,” “gentle glow,” “gentle echo”) and stacked figurative language without propulsion. Sentences often restate emotional states (“pain he had carried… began to take on a new form… no longer just his own pain”) without advancing knowledge or pressure. Final third is dense with thematic labeling (“messenger,” “vital message,” “hard softness”) that dulls closure. Read-aloud rhythm is monotonous due to repetitive syntactic openings.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “lucidly watchful,” “serene upheaval,” and “precision-crafted mechanisms” verge on ornamental abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“trial balloons… carefully crafted ideas… test the limits… push the boundaries”). The final paragraph repeats earlier imagery without deepening it. Still, sentence variety and rhythmic control maintain momentum, and no artifact obscures causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence in the discovery sequence carries metaphor (“ivy-veiled,” “whispers through walls,” “walls’ dreams”), creating slight muddle under pressure. Repetitive stems (“the cartographer... the cartographer...”) and synonym churn (“secrets,” “legacy,” “burden,” “story”) dilute momentum. Final paragraph loops conceptually without new pressure. Clarity remains intact, but information density suffers from ornamental phrasing that summarizes rather than dramatizes pivotal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from figurative overloading: “borrowed heartbeat,” “dusky harmony,” “coded lullaby,” “otherworldly light” recur without grounding. Adjacent sentences paraphrase (“colors dancing… dusky harmony”; “pulse with borrowed heartbeat… pulse with light”). Final third leans on abstraction (“beacon of possibility,” “magic beyond the edge”) that dulls closure specificity. Strong verbs and sensory detail are undercut by redundant lyrical scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe overwriting: figurative language saturates high-pressure beats (“stone hummed with weight of centuries,” “air alive with expectation”) without payoff. Paraphrase loops abound (“price of redemption… cost of failure… price he had paid”). Template cadence: repeated “As [X], Elian [Y]” constructions dull momentum. Final paragraph stacks passive observations (“darkness filled… eyes closed… terrace whispered”) instead of active closure, violating propulsion and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often dense with figurative language, especially in high-pressure beats (“thunder boomed… shake the very foundations”), risking overwriting. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“barren, cracked expanse” → “barren expanse” later). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm generally supports mood. However, key actions (“released the waters”) are summarized, not dramatized—telling replaces showing at the climax, dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is dense with figurative language—often beautiful but frequently overwrought (“bodily poetic form,” “prism sanctuary,” “harvest of echoes”). Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“threads began to unravel… cascade of echoes… shedding weight of unspoken words”), creating loop artifacts. Mixed metaphors (“lullaby of conformity,” “web… shroud,” “beacon of hope”) dilute clarity. Final third suffers from stacked abstractions that dull the closure image despite rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from paraphrase loops: “uncommonly serene atmosphere” and “meteor hush” reappear with near-identical phrasing across paragraphs, creating redundancy without added pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent; however, sentences like “Amaranth felt herself becoming a conduit” verge on label-speak without embodied action. Momentum stalls in mid-story summary (“ideas began to take shape…”) rather than dramatizing the creative struggle. Final paragraph’s trinkets “jingling softly” offers weak propulsion compared to the opening’s strong atmospheric hook.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought: phrases like “interrupted cadence,” “ethereal light,” and “blushing stillness” verge on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops (“fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful” echoed later as “fragile and beautiful”). Final third repeats “moth wing glowed” twice, dulling impact. Otherwise, strong sentence variety and sensory layering sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “snowmelt ardor,” “ethereal glow,” “otherworldly energy” verge on purple. Some redundancy (“painstaking, requiring patience and attention to detail”). Sentence openings vary adequately, but figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without payoff pattern, risking muddle. Final paragraph suffers from summary (“she had done it”) rather than pure image, dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and musical but occasionally over-figurative (“maze of reflections,” “dance of understood events”), risking purple prose in high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops, but some sentences stack modifiers (“singular, wafer seal”; “deep, ethereal grit”). Information density is high—most lines serve multiple functions. Final paragraph’s cadence resolves well, though “future that was both uncertain and full of possibility” edges toward generic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from dense figurative stacking (“shimmered like moonlight on a midnight lake,” “dusky harmony,” “wings of a dusky harmony”) that blurs causality and dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops abound: “encrypted devotion” is restated six times with near-synonym churn. Final third is saturated with summary (“life’s work was complete,” “universe would forever be changed”) instead of dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sentence openings vary moderately, but figurative density becomes oppressive in the climax (“golden light,” “essence of music,” “swirled around her”). Paraphrase loops occur: “balance and harmony were not static, but rather dynamic” echoes later as “harmony was possible.” Register drift into therapeutic jargon (“release,” “deep-seated wounds”) clashes with poetic tone, creating tonal friction without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information-per-line (e.g., “morbid perfume that clung to every surface”). Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths shift with momentum. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “shards of splintered light,” “shimmering expanse” verge on redundant lyricism. No loops or scaffold, but two adjacent lines near climax (“the glass mountains rising like a specter… air filled with expectant hush”) slightly paraphrase tension. Closure image remains sharp despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from mild overwriting: phrases like “deciduous in nature – it withered and died when not nurtured by mutual respect” verge on explanatory. The final paragraph summarizes resolution (“vows had not withered; they had flourished”) rather than dramatizing it, dulling closure impact. No egregious loops, but some sentences tell what could be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often evocative (“blossoms shimmering like stardust,” “mind expanding as if reality stretched”), but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“disquiet” → “brightened disquiet”) and abstract modifiers (“intoxicating,” “vibrant”). The phrase “simply complicated” feels like label-speak without behavioral manifestation. No severe loops, but elevated diction in the climax (“philosophical breakthrough”) dulls emotional propulsion slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is competent but marred by paraphrase loops (“navigating treacherous shelves and avoiding the shadowy pursuers” / “researching gaps... stay one step ahead”) and stacked abstractions (“weight of unlearned lessons slowly lifting”). Overuse of adjectives (“labyrinthine,” “arcane,” “dimly lit”) dilutes specificity. Final paragraph suffers from thematic echo: “seeker of knowledge, and a guardian of the unlearned lessons” states what should be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often evocative but over-relies on figurative density in key moments (“trapped freedom,” “labyrinthine corridors of her own mind”), creating near-paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors (“threads that bind” vs. “narrative threads”) blur coherence. Final paragraph’s “lush and vibrant oasis” resolves too cleanly, dulling the conceptual tension built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from mild overwriting: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“merge the threads of knowledge” appears twice), and metaphors like “fables of absence” lack concrete grounding. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence flattens during the climax (“As they worked… As Emilia watched…”). No fatal artifacts, yet synonym churn (“reconfigure,” “weave,” “merge”) dilutes propulsion. Closure image is clear but slightly dulled by redundant phrasing in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from paraphrase loops: “cacophony... storm of vibrations... discord” and “balance... harmony... serenity” cycle without deepening. The phrase “bloom of hush” appears four times with minimal variation, bordering on incantation over integration. Elevated diction (“hammered repose,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) occasionally drifts from plausible focalizer lexicon. Final third contains redundant affirmations (“peace,” “balance,” “harmony”) that dilute closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from overwriting: “shard of hush,” “thistle-blown optimism,” and “diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse” stack metaphors without grounding. Minor paraphrase loops (“secrets... uncovered,” “lost knowledge... rekindled”) dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s “warm, golden light” leans into cliché. Still, rhythm generally supports mood, and sentences advance atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“sculpt her identity from the experiences that had shaped her” borders on therapy-speak). Minor paraphrase loops: “collective memory” repeated without variation; “shadows... examined... measured” verges on redundancy. High information density overall, but figurative density peaks mid-story without payoff. Final paragraph tightens effectively. No scaffold or momentum drag, though one or two sentences could be trimmed for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“Lyra’s chants grew softer/louder/softer”) and near-duplicate clauses (“her mind was ablaze with ideas… imagination was now ablaze”). Overuse of “ambient awareness” and “filter” as abstract concepts dulls immediacy. Several sentences restate the same emotional beat (e.g., hopelessness lifting → spirits rising → sense of wonder). Final paragraph contains scaffold-like summation that could be trimmed for propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but repetitive: “transition period,” “texture of time,” “pause,” and “transformation” recur as conceptual anchors without variation. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“stillness, change was always present” / “even in stillness, change was always present”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, scaffold loops (“she pondered… she believed… she knew…”) dull propulsion. Final paragraph suffers from cadence fatigue despite strong individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: phrases like “intangibly tangible” and “gilded hush” repeat without evolving function, risking label-only abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (e.g., “silences… flavors of silence… flavors of different silences”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm breathes with the scene’s cadence. However, figurative density in peak beats slightly blurs causality—does the hush *cause* change or merely accompany it? This ambiguity dulls closure’s causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but overwrought: adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“stillness,” “quiet,” “hush”) and figurative density dilutes propulsion. Template cadence appears in repeated structures (“As she…”, “The gondola operator…”). The storm glass description uses mesmerizing/swirling/eddied/hypnotic in close proximity—synonym churn without added pressure. Final lines suffer from abstract assertion (“living, breathing entity”) rather than concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Overwriting mars key beats: “iridescent bark and leaves that shimmered like stardust,” “sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soft chirping of cybernetic birds” stack modifiers without advancing pressure. The phrase “weight of her quest settling upon her shoulders” recurs in near-identical form twice within 60 words—a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum. Final paragraph uses summary (“a new era was about to begin”) instead of concrete image to resolve, weakening propulsion. Otherwise, syntax varies and paragraph cuts serve rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often stacking metaphors (“shadows like dark tentacles,” “phoenix from the ashes”) that verge on purple without payoff. Repetitive phrasing appears (“the keeper’s touch was gentle… the keeper’s presence… the keeper’s footsteps”), creating paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary adequately, but information density suffers from summary over dramatization—key turns like “linking through scars” are told, not shown. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but mid-text overwriting dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose exhibits moderate overwriting: repetitive phrasing (“strange occurrences… strange noises”), stacked modifiers (“soft, blue-green glow”), and abstract nouns (“quantum promise,” “sense of possibility”) dilute momentum. The closure beat suffers from summary (“shower of diamonds rained down”) rather than dramatization, dulling impact. No severe artifacts, but information density falters in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is overwritten: adjacent sentences restate concepts (“standing waves revealed hidden patterns… underlying harmonics of reality”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but incoherent—“first yawn of evening,” “dynasty ender,” “gramophone crank as key”—without grounded mechanics. Template cadence appears in escalating descriptions (“As the light danced… As they turned… As the evening deepened…”). Final third suffers from summary (“legacy a testament… story would be told”) that dulls closure momentum and repeats thematic claims without new image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“murmured allegiance grew louder… gentle chant”; “reality shifted… fabric of the world tremble”). Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff (“trees leaned in… branches tangling… outstretched hands” → mixed botanical/human metaphors). Template cadence appears in action sequences (“As they wandered… As reality shifted… As the reality continued…”). Closure beat suffers from stacked modifiers dulling impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops (“forgotten stories… forgotten dreams… forgotten histories”) and synonym churn (“sanctuary of remembrance… testament to resilience… enduring power”) dilute momentum. Figurative density overwhelms key beats—e.g., “shadows recede as if stories pushed back darkness” mixes metaphor illogically. Template cadence dominates: 7+ sentences begin with “As she…” or “The…”. Final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions (“quiet, unassuming thing that unfolded like a flower”) that obscure emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from overwriting: figurative density peaks in nearly every sentence during the gathering scene without pattern payoff (“luminescent orbs,” “canvas upon which the future could be painted,” “vibrant colors of remembered history”). Paraphrase loops appear (“revised histories” / “histories that had been revised or erased”) and passive constructions dull propulsion (“it was when plans unravel... that Aria knew”). Final paragraph’s “beacon of hope” risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from overwriting: “vested hush,” “quietly vivid,” and “haunting resonance” recur as near-synonyms without added pressure. Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled—can music “seep through negative space”? The phrase “tendrils of fog curling like ethereal fingers” borders on mixed metaphor. Sentence openings vary, but some paragraphs loop conceptually (mist clearing, then returning) without narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“haunting beauty and air of mystery” / “eerie beauty”), and figurative density peaks in mid-text without payoff (“whispers of the past and promise of the future” → later restated). No scaffold loops or grammar errors, yet sentences sometimes prioritize texture over propulsion (e.g., “a mystical, otherworldly place” adds little). Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented: “swirling leaves that filled the greenhouse” followed by “leaves swirled around him” creates near-redundancy. Figurative density is high in mid-story without payoff (“scent of decay and rebirth” isn’t echoed later). Final paragraph’s “uncertainly certain” risks label-speak, though it’s grounded by the compass’s physical weight. Sentence openings vary well, but cadence slows in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lush but overladen with figurative density in high-pressure beats (“luminous regret,” “rain-washed sanctuary,” “intricate dance between realms”). Paraphrase loops appear: “brokenness,” “flaws,” and “imperfections” recur without progression; “weight of names” is restated four times with diminishing returns. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory rather than propulsive. Final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions that obscure emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is evocative but occasionally overwrought: “modestly fearless,” “luminous ache,” “distorted notes jarring the stillness” risk abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops (“quiet on the damp earth” appears twice). Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph suffers slight scaffolding (“a reminder… a beacon…”) that edges toward summary. Otherwise, rhythm supports atmosphere, and information density is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often vivid but suffers from overwriting in high-pressure beats: “pulsing light seeming to call,” “mind expanding to comprehend it.” The phrase “mathematics of mercy” appears twice as a thematic echo, functioning as label-speak rather than earned insight. Minor paraphrase loops (“remembered… recalled… memories came flooding back”) dull immediacy. Final paragraph’s closure image is clean, but figurative density occasionally blurs causality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in high-pressure beats: metaphors stack (“shard of moonlight,” “gentle lapping of waves,” “eternal instant”) without pattern-teaching, creating density without propulsion. Repetitive phrasing (“elusively tangible” x2, “hidden details” x3) and near-synonym loops (“unfasten… release… unlock”) dull momentum. Final paragraph suffers scaffold bloat—each sentence restates purpose without advancing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is evocative and generally propulsive, with strong sensory layering (“fluorescent buzz dies off,” “scent of decay”). However, repetitive constructions appear: “Ezra... Ezra... Ezra” openings; “the ghosts... the ghosts...” echoes. Mild overwriting in mid-section (“ethereal forms flickering,” “cracks in the façade... beginning to show”) leans on familiar phrasing. Final paragraph tightens effectively, but synonym churn (“secrets... stories... whispers”) slightly dulls momentum. No fatal artifacts, but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or concept. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the narrative arc. However, mild overwriting appears in peak beats: “soft susurrations weaving in and out of the operator's thoughts” borders on mixed metaphor, and “tentative fingers” for cloud tendrils verges on cliché. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density slightly dulls propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, occasionally bordering on overwriting (“words flowing like a river of fire”), but largely controlled. Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths shift with emotional cadence, and information density is high. Minor redundancy appears in repeated “reimagine, recreate, rediscover” phrasing and dual mentions of “burnished sorrow.” No fatal loops, but slight scaffold in the storm’s recurrence dulls propulsion just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often beautiful but occasionally overwritten: adjacent sentences restate concepts (“mend what wasn't torn, to restore the essence of the music rather than just its physical form”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high in peak beats (“tear in the fabric of silence”) without pattern-teaching payoff, risking opacity. Sentence openings vary adequately, but rhythmic propulsion falters in descriptive passages. No grammar errors, yet some modifiers feel ornamental (“palpable aura of tinkersong wonder”) rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-embellished: “otherworldly energy,” “mystical realm,” and “unfolding its secrets like a lotus flower” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“resonant hush” appears three times with little variation). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but figurative density in the climax slightly dulls clarity—costing a full point from 8.9 potential.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“intricate, ephemeral creations” / “rich tapestry of meaning and symbolism”), and figurative density peaks without pattern payoff (“turbine-hum reverie” feels decorative). Mixed metaphor logic: “scaffold complexity with simplicity” clashes with organic driftwood imagery. Final paragraph suffers from paraphrase loops (“hidden patterns… waiting to be uncovered… ready to continue her journey”). Momentum stalls in reflective blocks lacking micro-action, though rhythm varies adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished but occasionally over-ornamented: “umbral tenderness” appears three times, verging on motif churn. Some adjacent lines paraphrase (“flowers bloomed under moonlight” → “hidden world that came alive at night”). Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in peak beats (e.g., “secrets etched into her soul like delicate patterns on a petal”) risks purple prose. Still, rhythm supports thematic accumulation, and closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence-level craft is generally strong, with varied syntax and purposeful description. But overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: phrases like “searing reverie” and “intricate web of memories” verge on purple prose. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“hidden truths and unseen connections,” “memories and experiences”). The closing lines repeat “secrets” and “truth” without propulsion, dulling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“The alchemist...”, “The town...”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “revival and rebirth,” “crumbling structures and overgrown streets”). Figurative language is dense but occasionally generic (“ashes of the old,” “canvas waiting to be filled”). The final third relies on summary rather than scene, dulling momentum. While readable, the line-level craft prioritizes mood over propulsion, with several adjacent sentences restating the same idea without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: adjacent sentences restate emotional states (“soothing and unsettling,” “wonder, mixed with trepidation”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high without payoff—“words flowed like a gentle stream” adds little. Final third suffers from scaffold phrases (“the consequences… were only just beginning”) that dull closure. Strong openings and sensory specificity offset mid-story redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose overwrites in high-pressure beats: “pulled apart and put back together again, with the very fabric of time and space bending” stacks abstractions without concrete anchor. Paraphrase loops appear (“delicate balance that sustained the world” → “delicate harmony of the world”). Figurative density overwhelms clarity during the vortex climax (mixed vehicles: “kaleidoscope,” “fabric,” “tug”). Final paragraph repeats “mysteries,” “possibilities,” “balance” as thematic scaffolding. Strong opening (“icebound atrium… glistening under starlight”) contrasts with flaccid closure (“walked away, into the unknown”).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation and concrete diction (“glue had dried,” “rope swaying gently”). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: “subtle rhythms of the sanctuary” appears three times with slight variation, creating a loop. Final paragraph risks purple prose (“benediction,” “spirit at one with the solstice hush”) that borders on abstraction. Still, information density remains high, and momentum flows cleanly toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lyrical and evocative, but suffers from paraphrase loops (“sense of flourishing stillness” appears three times with minimal variation) and stacked abstractions (“primal elegance,” “celestial ballet”). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats (e.g., stars “twinkled like diamonds”), but mixed metaphors emerge (“sanctuary” vs. “contraptions”). Final third contains therapy-speak (“find strength in vulnerability”) that reads as label-only rather than embodied. Sentence openings vary adequately, but scaffold phrases (“As the night wore on… As they returned…”) create template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is lush but over-modified in high-pressure beats (“tranquilly perceptive eyes,” “desolate sorrow,” “mute eloquence”). Repetitive stems appear: “the recluse’s gaze... the recluse’s eyes... the recluse’s thoughts.” Final paragraph’s “beauty to be found” verges on thematic echo. Information density is strong early, but momentum slows mid-story with static description. No fatal loops, but figurative density borders on purple in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “disjointed timeline,” “timeless world,” “hidden patterns” recur without deepening. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“task… shifted to understanding” / “began to rediscover”) creating mild scaffold loops. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraphs lean on abstract nouns (“hope,” “transformation,” “beauty”) that weaken the closing image’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrought: “burnished hush that wrapped around her like a shroud,” “woven dawns,” “threads of time and experience” verge on purple. Repetition dulls impact (“gentle lapping... soothing melody” appears twice). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, adjacent lines restate ideas (“world reborn... beauty burnished”). Final paragraph loops (“beauty... grateful... moment... beauty”), softening closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“gently systematic approach,” “brazen calm,” “botanical diary” recur with minimal variation) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “transformed into a vibrant, thriving entity” followed by “flourished”). Figurative density is high without pattern payoff—copper wire “sings” repeatedly without evolving metaphor. Final paragraph stacks near-identical clauses (“a reminder… a reminder…”) creating syntactic monotony. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure emotional precision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    Overwriting plagues key beats: “bronze quiet,” “ethereal light,” “palpable sense of anticipation” recur without functional payoff, creating figurative density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear (“the path... now lay shrouded” / “once a grand promenade”), and filter verbs (“they pondered,” “their thoughts turned”) dull immediacy. The final third suffers from stacked modifiers that blur emotional clarity despite rhythmic fluency.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often overwritten: figurative density persists through every paragraph (“gloom-hill,” “blooming jetty,” “submerged concord”), creating a static texture that dulls momentum. Repetitive phrasing (“blooming flowers” appears three times; “coachman” opens four sentences) and near-synonym loops (“teeming with life” / “teeming with promise”) reduce propulsion. Final third suffers from summary (“task complete,” “mission accomplished”) rather than dramatization. Sentence openings lack variety, leaning on subject-verb patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush and image-rich but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “tinted revelations” and “wild hush” verge on opaque abstraction. Some redundancy appears (“cracked wasteland” / “cracked earth”; “silence... filled with... crunch” paradox). Sentence variety is strong, yet figurative density in key beats (e.g., orb revelation) obscures causality. Final paragraph’s cadence is elegant, but earlier passages suffer slight scaffold (“pushed forward... footsteps echoing... air heavy”).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft is polished but marred by recurring figurative density: “twinkling like diamonds,” “gilded compass rose,” “echoed silence” appear multiple times with minimal variation, creating a templated cadence. The phrase “true north” is repeated mechanically, and “bittersweet” + “determination” + “wonder” form a predictable emotional arc. Final paragraph suffers from stacked modifiers (“uncertain and full of promise,” “soft whisper of possibility”) that dilute propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong sentence-level propulsion in descriptive passages. But high-pressure beats suffer from figurative density without payoff—e.g., “air thick with otherworldly energy” adds texture but no causality. Minor paraphrase loops (“swirling mists… swirling vortex”) and passive constructions dull immediacy. Closure image is clean, though slightly over-ornamented (“brushstrokes of their next adventure”).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (“eerie silence,” “shadowy realm,” “tapestry of meaning”), creating a slight muddle in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“silence was broken… new story began”; “poised on the threshold… suspended in a moment”). Final lines suffer from abstract summarization rather than concrete image. Still, syntax varies well and momentum holds despite ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, but suffers from overwriting: adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“shelves upon shelves,” “mysterious artifacts… long shadows that danced like restless spirits”). Mixed metaphors (“reality that substitutes reality nightly,” “threads of forgotten memories”) blur clarity. The final third leans on abstract intensifiers (“wondrous and unknown,” “potential for transformation”) that dull the closure image. Rhythm varies, but information density falters under decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: metaphors accumulate without pattern-teaching (“woven hush,” “shroud,” “ebb of tide,” “map to treasure”), risking density overload in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“threads of reality from those of deception” / “threads of the tapestry… became a map”). Final third uses elevated diction (“fierce repose,” “abiding peace”) that slightly distances emotional immediacy. Still, information density is high, rhythm modulates well, and no scaffold sentences stall momentum—though figurative muddle in the labyrinth entrance scene dulls causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often beautiful, but overwriting dulls key beats: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“refract a single truth into many… reveal the complexity”), and metaphors multiply without pruning (“towers of bone,” “pale spire,” “veil of mist,” “divine glimpse”). The final third suffers from explanatory redundancy (“a reminder of the price of forgiveness…”) that flattens momentum. Sentence variety exists, but cadence becomes incantatory to the point of predictability.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, though occasional redundancy dulls momentum (“creaked and groaned” appears twice; “churned and foamed” similarly repeated). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent—no mixed metaphors. However, adjacent lines restate concepts: “conjuring meaning… no matter how slim the chance” followed by near-identical phrasing later. Final paragraph’s charm description echoes earlier without deepening, creating a subtle paraphrase loop. Read-aloud rhythm falters slightly in mid-section due to stacked participial phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“the world around her melted away, leaving only the canvas and the sea” / “leaving only the art”), and figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching (“ablate with hues,” “temporary eternity,” “intimately aloof”). Template cadence appears in action sequences (“she picked it up… turned it over… painted it”). Final paragraph suffers from summary-looping and conceptual redundancy, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“gentle whisper,” “gentle, insistent voice”) and stacked figurative language that muddles causality in high-pressure beats. Key lines like “vibrations of intent reaching a crescendo, a screaming tenderness” mix incompatible metaphors (sound + touch + emotion) without grounding. Template cadence appears in action descriptions (“He had spent… now the fruits…”), dulling immediacy. Closure beat is overwritten, obscuring emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic but occasionally overwrites: metaphors like “canvas of shadows and light” and “topography of loss” approach abstraction, and adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (e.g., “raw solace” appears twice with minimal variation). Sentence openings vary well, and paragraph cuts serve emotional cadence. However, the final third leans on summary (“the journey was long and arduous…”) rather than dramatized struggle, and “cryptic phone calls” are told, not shown, creating a slight momentum drag. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold weakens propulsion in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density without propulsion: “fractured grace,” “twisted trees and tangled undergrowth,” “enduring power of nature” verge on purple abstraction. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“battered and storm-torn landscape” → “ravaged orchard”). Final paragraph stacks atmospheric clauses without advancing knowledge or pressure. No glaring errors, but scaffold phrases (“seemed to mirror,” “felt a sense of”) dilute immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often elegant but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“mist swirled,” “witnessed isolation” appears three times) and near-paraphrase loops (e.g., “lost in thought” followed by “recalling a memory”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, the final third relies on summary (“Kael felt the weight…”) rather than dramatization. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence occasionally stalls in descriptive accumulations that don’t advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“glimmered,” “blooming flowers,” “doorway of decisions”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “path disappeared… choices clearer” restated across paragraphs). Figurative density is high but often generic (“maze of dusty relics,” “weight of her promise lifting”). Final third contains scaffold sentences summarizing realization rather than dramatizing it. Momentum stalls in descriptive passages that don’t advance pressure or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.7)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: figurative density overwhelms propulsion (“shadows writhing like living things,” “malevolent energy seeping into bones,” “lacy menace”). Paraphrase loops recur (“sense of trepidation,” “sense of purpose,” “sense of foreboding”) and template cadence weakens momentum. Final third relies on summary (“found a truth… that would change her forever”) rather than concrete image or action, dulling closure. Sentence variety exists, but rhythm often stalls under stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“revalue its significance… uncover new insights… see it in a new light”) and conceptual redundancy across adjacent lines. Overuse of abstract nouns (“resolve,” “presence,” “spontaneity”) replaces concrete action. Figurative density is high but unpatterned—metaphors (“palette of resolve”) lack physical coherence. Final paragraph’s scaffolded summary (“memory… reminder…”) stalls momentum instead of resolving by image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“blurred together,” “tangled threads,” “kaleidoscope of memories”) and paraphrase loops—e.g., “chaos into narrative” appears three times with minimal variation. Figurative density is high but inconsistent: “feral nostalgia” is evocative but undefined, while “jaded wonder” feels like label-speak. Final paragraphs stack abstractions (“endless possibility,” “inner light,” “sense of wonder”) that dull closure impact. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often lush but over-reliant on figurative language without variation in high-pressure beats (“soothing melody,” “trembling calm,” “ordinary miracles”). Paraphrase loops appear: multiple sentences restate Elara’s realization about hidden beauty. Final third contains summary-heavy lines (“her work… was not just about healing…”) that tell rather than show, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but mostly precise, with strong verbs (“gliding,” “shattered,” “etched”) and varied sentence openings. However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “saturated hush” repeats twice, and “whispers of the runes faded into the silence, leaving behind a saturated hush” creates a paraphrase loop in the final lines. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Momentum stalls slightly in reflective blocks, though BRR allowance is met.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sentence-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “whispered prayers, the misplaced objects, the serendipitous encounters” verges on list-like rhythm, and “grit of the world’s imperfections tempered by the ethereal beauty” leans into mixed abstraction. No fatal loops, but two adjacent sentences restate the orchard’s impending loss without added pressure. Closure image remains clear despite slight register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“timeless and fleeting,” “inner and outer worlds”), and figurative density blurs causality (“words danced,” “silence grew, a resounding hush”). Template cadence appears in action sequences (“As she stepped… As she walked…”), dulling propulsion. Final paragraph repeats “journey inward and outward” without new pressure, violating loop screen.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is often elegant but suffers from paraphrase loops (“the shepherd remained vigilant… ever watchful… ever vigilant and always counting”) and redundant cadences (“as the sun dipped… as the stars began… as the night wore on…”). Figurative density is high without payoff—phrases like “fabric of time was being tuned” border on abstraction without grounding. Final third contains scaffold sentences that summarize rather than advance (“the counting would continue…”), dulling momentum and weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative language (“quiet wildfire,” “ethereal light”) that borders on purple in high-density passages. Repetitive phrasing (“Lena felt… Lena began… Lena realized…”) creates syntactic monotony, and adjacent sentences often paraphrase the same insight (e.g., “boundaries blur” → “becoming part of it”). The final third suffers from conceptual redundancy without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetitive phrasing dulls momentum: “the mica pane… seemed to glow” appears three times with minor variation, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high but often static (“misty gloom,” “ethereal light”) without advancing plot or pressure. Sentences frequently summarize rather than dramatize (“she realized…”, “she began to see…”). Final paragraph restates resolve already established, adding no new propulsion or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“a dance of beginnings and endings” / “no end, only a continuous cycle”), creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled (“melodically haunted quality” lacks concrete anchor). Final paragraph suffers from abstract summarization (“simple, yet profound, beauty”) that dulls emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“the archivist’s work…”, “the story of the couple…”), synonym churn (“meticulously documenting,” “carefully placed,” “gently thorough”), and abstract modifiers (“ethereal glow,” “poignant reminder”). The final third loops through near-identical thematic assertions without propulsion. Figurative density is high but unvaried, creating a monotonous cadence that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is vivid but overuses figurative language in high-pressure beats (“ivy tendrils… skeletal fingers,” “gentle virus,” “fabric of reality”), creating slight density drag. Some redundancy appears: “desperation and despair slowly giving way” followed by “tense, fearful atmosphere” restates mood. Final lines avoid purple excess, but mid-story metaphors occasionally blur causality with lyricism, dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, with high information-per-line (e.g., “skin absorbed the sweet fragrance, their tattoos shifting”). Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with the melody. Minor overwriting in peak beats: “quiet blaze” repeats three times, slightly dulling its charge. No loops or scaffold, but “piercing note” → “converge” → “illuminate” leans on adjacent abstractions. Closure image remains clear despite slight figurative stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high information density, though occasional abstraction (“confidently uncertain,” “thresh meaning”) edges toward label-speak. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but metaphors like “fabric of space-time” border on familiar. Sentence rhythm supports mood, yet the climax (“words flowed effortlessly”) lacks propulsion. Closure image is clear but slightly over-smoothed, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: figurative density in high-pressure beats (“symphony of silence,” “orchestrated moonlight”) blurs causality. Repetitive phrasing (“whispers of the past,” “luminous harbor”) creates synonym loops. Key moments are summarized (“began to weave the silence into a melody”) rather than dramatized. Final paragraph stacks abstractions without concrete propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“As…”, “With…”, “The…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple sentences reiterating Elian’s purpose). Overwriting abounds: “flickering fluorescent lights above casting an eerie glow” → “shadows… dancing across the walls like the whispers of the past.” The final third is dense with summary (“Years might pass…”) that dulls momentum. Figurative language is frequent but often generic (“canopy of light,” “heart ablaze”), lacking specificity or causal propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from figurative density: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries metaphor (“petal-like structures,” “auroral sorrow,” “vortex of light and sound”), risking overload. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“sound waves danced… sound waves washed over it… sound waves responded”). Final paragraph repeats “sound wave garden seemed to…” twice, dulling momentum. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with clarity despite ornamental tendencies.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and evocative, with strong verbs (“loomed,” “howling,” “etched”) and varied syntax. Information density is high: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though one near-redundancy occurs (“folded maps… creased and worn”). Figurative language is controlled; the “chorus of restless spirits” metaphor coheres with tone. Final lines avoid purple prose, landing cleanly on concrete images (coin, map, key), preserving momentum through the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“stillwater tension” restated identically; “unreadable expression” twice) and scaffold sentences that summarize instead of dramatize (“presence was a testament…”). Overuse of figurative language (“dance in the fading light,” “vibrate with silent empathy”) without payoff creates density without propulsion. Final paragraph repeats closure beats already made, dulling momentum. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory to the point of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: stacked abstractions (“hush where past meets prophecy,” “amplified quiet determination”) and repetitive conceptual phrasing (“forests of second thoughts” appears four times). Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“visualizations grew more vivid, a testament to Elian's amplified quiet determination” → “heart filled with a sense of purpose”). Final third contains scaffold-heavy lines (“bathed in the gentle glow of second thoughts”) that dull closure impact through redundancy and label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: “combative tenderness,” “lotus blooming in darkness,” and “ethereal light” verge on purple. Adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“heart unlock… guarded depths revealed”; “freedom… state of being”) creating minor loops. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without payoff, dulling the closure’s impact. Still, rhythm varies and paragraph cuts serve emotional pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is often dense with figurative language, occasionally tipping into overwriting (“weave a hypnotic spell,” “fragile peace that settled like a shroud”). Some paraphrase loops: “cultivating lightness in grief” and “remade hush” repeat without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well, but mid-story cadence leans on similar syntactic structures. Final paragraph achieves clarity and propulsion, though “emotionally barren existence” edges into therapy-speak. High information density overall, with few wasted lines.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from overwriting: adjacent lines restate ideas (“boundaries dissolved” / “released into limitless possibility”), and metaphors accumulate without pruning (“lantern-moth hush,” “tapestry of sound,” “river breaking its banks”). The final third leans on paraphrase loops (“dissolve,” “transform,” “uncover”) that dull momentum. No fatal errors, but density impedes clarity at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting abounds: stacked modifiers (“soft clinking,” “delicate petals,” “breathtakingly beautiful”), repetitive phrasing (“the courtyard was… the courtyard remained…”), and figurative density without payoff. Key beats suffer paraphrase loops (“he began to awaken… he worked… he saw”). Final lines echo opening without deepening, creating circular redundancy. Prose prioritizes mood over propulsion, stalling momentum with decorative description.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but over-ornamented: metaphors like “music was like a soft focus lens” strain coherence, and adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“uncovered hidden patterns,” “uncovering new sounds”). Filter verbs (“felt,” “reached,” “began to propel”) dull immediacy. Final paragraph suffers from scaffolded closure (“However, to meet the word count...”) that breaks immersion and reveals artificial construction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: metaphors like “fabric of reality was being manipulated” and “kaleidoscope of colors” border on purple without advancing causality. A paraphrase loop appears in lines describing the curtains’ effect (“guide the viewer toward their deepest desires” / “unlock their secrets and channel their power”). Sentence openings vary well, but high-pressure beats suffer from stacked modifiers (“delicate, filigree-like brooch that seemed to capture the very essence of the stars”). Still, rhythm generally supports emotional cadence, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: adjacent sentences frequently restate ideas (“task that required patience… undertaken with fervor”; “mystery deepening… fabric of reality revealed”). Template cadence appears in triple constructions (“With each careful measurement… With each new insight… With a sense of quiet satisfaction”). Figurative density is high throughout, including in reflective beats, creating a uniform texture that lacks propulsion. Final paragraph’s “footsteps faded… world more mysterious” is a paraphrase loop that dulls closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: “atoms of nostalgia,” “end of innocence,” and “anguished joy” recur with near-synonym churn, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high in climactic beats without pattern-teaching payoff, risking purple prose. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence falters in summary-heavy closing paragraphs where momentum stalls. No fatal artifacts, but line-level propulsion dips during reflection blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors stack (“sea of clouds,” “tendrils through the collective unconscious”) without always clarifying stakes. A paraphrase loop occurs in paragraphs 4–5 (“shadowy presence… darkness that was not quite there” echoed later). Sentence openings vary well, but cadence flattens in mid-story exposition about shared dreams. Final third avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity, though “luminous regret” appears twice with diminishing returns.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrites: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“reconstructing... habitats” / “reconstruct her understanding”), “shimmering stillness” repeats four times, and figurative density (mist as “living entity,” convictions “like river”) blurs focus in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in “As she... As the... As the...” constructions. Final third suffers from scaffold loops (“layer by layer,” “peeling back the layers”) that dull closure impact and trigger artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwritten—figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without payoff (“maelstrom of images,” “boundless sea”). Repetitive phrasing (“whispers of the plants seemed to grow louder… gentle susurrus”) creates synonym loops. The phrase “displaced miracle” appears once, unanchored, disrupting momentum. Final paragraph leans on summary (“journey was far from over”) rather than charged image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“poignant expression of longing and regret” / “enduring power of human emotion”), and metaphors accumulate without pruning (“autumn leaves on a gusty day,” “hush before thunder,” “mournful sigh”). The final paragraph suffers slight paraphrase-looping (“secrets uncovered,” “love that would continue to resonate”). Rhythm varies well, but figurative density in peak beats slightly dulls emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is often overwritten: metaphors stack (“celestial ballet,” “wings of pure enchantment,” “hypnotic spell”) without pattern-teaching, creating figurative density that dulls propulsion. Repetitive phrasing (“tracing the path,” “unwritten calendar,” “shadowed rapture”) appears across adjacent lines. Final paragraph suffers from paraphrase loops (“memory of the stardust… magic that lay just beyond…”). Clarity remains intact, but momentum drags under lyrical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: “ethereal glow,” “fractured lullaby,” “kaleidoscope of color” recur without grounding. Adjacent sentences paraphrase (“shimmer,” “vibrated,” “pulsed”) creating loop-like redundancy. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff, slightly dulling closure clarity. Strong opening and closing lines, but mid-text momentum sags under stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: adjacent lines paraphrase (“hum grew louder… symphony of vibrations”; “trees faded… blurring into distance”). Template cadence appears in wind descriptions (“familiar and strange” repeated verbatim). Figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching payoff; “roar” contradicts earlier “gentle buzzing.” Final paragraph loops opening motifs without deepening, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative, but overuses figurative language without pattern payoff (“serpent,” “balm,” “lullaby,” “glow with inner light”). Adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“footsteps quiet on the damp earth” / “footsteps quiet on the ridgeway”), creating mild loop drag. No syntactic monotony, but elevated diction (“otherworldly energy,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) slightly distances the reader. Momentum remains intact, though density occasionally outweighs propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“silence was… no longer oppressive, no longer a burden… instead, it was a reminder”) and stacked abstractions (“frostbitten hope,” “monument to the power of silence”). Figurative density is high but often decorative: “walls absorbing the cold like a sponge” adds texture without advancing causality. Sentence openings vary, but rhythmic propulsion stalls in reflective blocks. The closure beat is dulled by summary (“they found a sense of peace”) rather than concrete image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: “glittering stars” eyes, “eerie shadows,” “coalesce into a figure” verge on cliché. Minor redundancy (“worked tirelessly… days turned into weeks… presence became rumor”). No syntactic monotony, but some phrases (“cryptic messages… larger narrative… tale of a rune”) loop conceptually. Final paragraph tightens well, though “enduring legacy” leans toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“rhythm echoed,” “paths disappeared,” “secrets uncovered”) and near-paraphrase loops (e.g., “stress melt away” / “clear her mind”). Figurative density is high without payoff—metaphors like “fish swimming just beneath the surface” feel decorative. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence becomes predictable in reflective passages. Closure beat is dulled by abstraction (“ocean whispered its secrets”) rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely precise and evocative, with strong verbs (“slapping,” “thrums,” “refracted”) and varied sentence structures. However, minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “thunderous serenity,” “awaken dormant passions,” and “complexity of her own renewed spirit” verge on stock lyricism. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density slightly blurs clarity in the climax. Final image remains sharp, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: “whispers rising to a fevered pitch,” “shimmer with hidden light,” “lotus blooming in the sun” stack metaphors without grounding. Paraphrase loops appear (“decode… unlock secrets… unseal the message”). Final paragraph repeats “evolve,” “reshape,” “unlock” without propulsion. Syntax varies but rhythm flattens under purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-ornamented: metaphors stack (“endless expanse of blue-gray silk,” “soothing melody of rise and fall”) without advancing causality, creating density without propulsion. Adjacent lines paraphrase emotional states (“frazzled nerves” → “anxiety begin to unravel” → “tension eased”), triggering loop penalties. The final paragraph’s serenade imagery repeats earlier motifs without intensification, dulling closure momentum. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from dense figurative layering without variation—nearly every sentence carries metaphor, creating a monotonous cadence. Repetitive stems (“the artist…”, “the broken…”) and synonym loops (“fragments,” “threads,” “tangled”) create scaffold fatigue. Key lines like “luminescent ache” recur without deepening, functioning as refrains rather than evolving images. Overwriting obscures emotional clarity, especially in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, especially during tracking sequences. Minor overwriting in climactic beats: “world around them dissolving into a sea of uncertainty” uses mixed metaphor (dissolving + sea). Filter verbs (“Kael noticed,” “Kael realized”) appear but aren’t clustered. Final paragraph’s “ethereal light” and “world at peace” verge on generic resolution, slightly dulling closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic stems (“Aria... Aria... Aria...”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “bravely conflicted heart” restated as “conflicted heart now a symbol”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion in the climax—phrases like “digital winds” and “murmurs of a present reborn” obscure rather than clarify stakes. Final paragraph uses abstract nouns (“turmoil,” “transformation”) where concrete detail would anchor resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from repetitive conceptual loops: “tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet,” “senselessly perceptive” recur as near-synonyms without deepening. Adjacent sentences frequently paraphrase (e.g., “sanctuary where life could flourish” / “haven for those seeking refuge”). Figurative density is high but occasionally static—roses “unfold like tiny, delicate works of art” reads as decorative rather than revelatory. Final paragraphs accumulate abstractions (“beacon,” “true calling”) that dull the closing image’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense with figurative language but largely coherent; metaphors (“sound wave garden,” “voicing silence”) are sustained. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“transliterating emotions… tuning into frequency… becoming one with vibrations”) borders on paraphrase-loop. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Final paragraphs avoid scaffold, though “magic that occurred when patterns break themselves” slightly abstracts what earlier imagery earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“orbits of regret” appears four times), paraphrase loops (“uncover the truth… uncover hidden truths”), and stacked abstractions (“solemn playfulness,” “echoing observatory”). Figurative density is high but often self-referential (“clouds swirl in tandem with her mind”), creating lyrical redundancy without propulsion. Final paragraph repeats setup imagery without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but occasionally overwrites: phrases like “twisting and writhing like living things” and “infused with a newfound power” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“dissonance of old guilt… haunting her… guilt began to surface… guilt lose its hold”). Yet sentence variety, sensory layering, and momentum largely compensate. No artifacts directly dull the closure, though figurative density slightly blurs causality in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often beautiful but suffers from repetitive conceptual loops: “emergent hush” appears three times with near-identical phrasing; “lilac unease” recurs without deepening. Adjacent sentences paraphrase (“The sand mandala was a reflection…” appears verbatim twice). Figurative density is high but occasionally self-canceling (“gentle roar” contradicts “hush”). Final paragraph’s scaffold (“felt… as if…”) dilutes the closing image’s potency.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from overwriting: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“shattered sky… bleak… hopeless”; “glimmer of hope… warmth spreading”). Figurative density is high without payoff—“arms of steel,” “warm coldness,” “cradle empathy” feel like stacked abstractions. The final paragraph repeats closure beats already made, dulling impact. While rhythm varies, template cadence emerges in reflective passages (“She stood… She felt… She knew…”), and key insights are told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“hand-painted tarot coin” appears four times with minimal variation) and stacked modifiers (“ethereal realm,” “otherworldly energy,” “mystic orchard garden”). Adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“echoes grew louder… timeline began to repair” / “echoes grew fainter… garden returned”) without added pressure. Figurative density is high but coherent; however, template cadence (“As she… As the… With each…”) dulls propulsion in the middle third. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: “willowglass hope,” “sea of mental images,” “fabric of reality reshaped” verge on purple abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (e.g., repeated emphasis on geode’s “delicate, glittering” nature). Sentence variety is adequate, but high-pressure beats suffer from stacked modifiers and conceptual vagueness. Closure image is vivid but obscured by lyrical inflation rather than clarified.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“heat-map,” “elm leaf fossil,” “coastal cave network” reused without variation) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “chart the unmapped territories” → “uncover the mysteries”). Figurative density is high but often decorative (“float on a tide of emotions,” “kaleidoscope of color”) without advancing causality. Final third contains scaffold sentences that summarize rather than dramatize, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from paraphrase loops (“whispers of the sands,” “reverberations of the canyon echo” repeated across paragraphs) and stacked modifiers (“warm, golden light of the amber warehouse, now a beacon of shared wisdom”). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats, creating a drumbeat cadence that dulls momentum rather than propelling it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“mist swirled… silver hush… mist swirled”) and redundant emotional labeling (“sense of peace,” “sense that she was on the verge of fixing”). Figurative density is high but often generic (“damp shroud,” “skeletal fingers”), with mixed metaphoric logic (snow “codes” never operationalized). Final third repeats closure beats verbatim (“ready to face whatever lay ahead… world full of possibility”), dulling propulsion. Sentence openings vary early but collapse into template rhythm during the doppelgänger scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery (“silken umbilical cord,” “spindrift serenity”) and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears (“mind begin to percolate with thoughts and memories, like the gentle simmer of a pot”). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“slow, deliberate precision” / “movements slow and deliberate”), and “palimpsest promise” edges into conceptual abstraction without grounding. Still, momentum holds, and every sentence serves atmosphere or character. Closure image is clear, though the phrase “distilled complexity into simplicity” risks diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: metaphors stack (“thrums,” “pulsing heartbeat,” “lotus unfolding”) without pattern payoff. Repetitive phrasing (“fractured timelines,” “gentle curves”) verges on scaffold. Final third avoids major artifacts, but “phototropic to kindness” reads as label-speak, not embodied trait. High information density in description, yet momentum stalls in reflective loops lacking present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (“weaving a spell,” “wrapped in a soft blanket”), dulling impact. Repetitive phrasing (“sense of…”, “as if…”) creates scaffold loops, especially in middle paragraphs. Final third suffers from summary (“work was done… impact would be felt”) rather than dramatization. Rhythm is musical but uniform, lacking propulsion or syntactic variety under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “brittle awakenings” appears four times with minimal variation; “coexist” and “forge a new path” recur like refrains. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“preserve the knowledge… forge a new path” / “honor the memories… forge a new path”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, looped abstractions dull momentum in the final third, especially around closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is strong but marred by mild overwriting: stacked modifiers (“soft, diffused light”; “kaleidoscope of color and texture”) and near-redundant phrasing (“hidden patterns that governed the universe” / “thread that connected all things”). No fatal loops, but “prismatic quiet” feels like a coined phrase straining for profundity. Final paragraph’s repetition of sensory details (“lapping water,” “sweet scent”) borders on scaffold, slightly dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“charts held the key… now seemed to hold new significance”), template cadence (“As she… As the…”), and stacked abstractions (“sense of gratitude,” “spirit infused with anticipation”). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without payoff, dulling momentum. The final paragraph reads like lyrical scaffolding rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from overwriting: phrases like “spatial mutiny,” “fallow period,” and “wistful rebellion” lean into ornamental abstraction. The church organ appears abruptly without setup, and its mechanics remain unexplained, creating a minor causality gap. Some redundancy (“haunting refrain,” “ghostly presence,” “lonely church organ”) edges toward motif churn. Final paragraphs use elevated diction (“reverberations... resonating deep within her soul”) that slightly overshoots Lyra’s plausible interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and atmospheric, with varied sentence lengths and strong verbs (“lance the boil,” “mist swirled”). Minor overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “poignant reminder of the dual nature of human identity” edges into label-speak. No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences restate the ribbon’s symbolic role (“curiosity” → “symbol”). Final third remains clean—no artifacts dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from paraphrase loops (“Emilia pressed on… Emilia’s focus never wavered… Emilia’s journey was far from over”) and redundant intensifiers (“eerie, spongey dread,” “thicker, like a fog”). Figurative language is dense but coherent; however, “spongey dread” is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles sensory logic. Sentence variety exists, but cadence becomes incantatory without propulsion—momentum stalls in reflective summary rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often lush and musical, but suffers from paraphrase loops (“the weight of their secrets slowly lifting… began to see the world… in a new light”) and stacked abstractions (“river of light,” “threshold to a new reality”). Figurative density is high in peak beats without payoff—e.g., “ashes of ‘never’” appears three times with diminishing returns. Sentence openings vary, but cadence occasionally slips into templated lyricism (“As they walked… As the years went by…”). Momentum stalls in reflective summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose exhibits strong sensory texture but suffers from paraphrase loops (“polished calm settled… now seemed to emanate from within”) and redundant thematic restatements. Figurative density is high yet often decorative—“dusky harmony,” “fragile harmony,” “soothing serenade” repeat mood without advancing pressure. Final paragraph stacks abstract nouns (“legacy,” “paths,” “stories”) that dilute closure impact through summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally polished with varied syntax and purposeful detail, but exhibits minor scaffold: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“burdens… manageable” appears twice within 100 words). Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., “world bathed in new light,” “beacon of hope”) without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. No fatal loops, but synonym churn (“solace,” “peace,” “renewed determination”) slightly dulls momentum. Final paragraph’s propulsion falters with cumulative abstraction, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic stems (“The druid’s…”, “As they…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “trepidation and determination” echoed later as “excitement mixed with trepidation”). Figurative density is high but often static (“malevolent energy,” “grotesque forms”) without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks summary over scene, dulling momentum: “journey was long… undaunted… truth was worth the struggle.”

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: stacked modifiers (“precision-cut hedges and serpentine paths”), redundant phrasing (“whisper secrets only she could hear” / “whispers of the ancients”), and figurative density without payoff. The final third repeats opening motifs verbatim (“scent of damp earth and blooming wildflowers”) as scaffold, not evolution. Template cadence appears in consecutive “As she...” constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in peak beats—e.g., “morbid perfume that clung to her skin,” “threads of her own making.” Repetitive constructions (“the trees, the roots, and the bones”) create scaffold loops, and metaphors accumulate without pruning (“skeletal fingers,” “twisted roots,” “half-lit corridors”). Final paragraph suffers from stacked modifiers and near-synonym churn (“brighter future,” “more whole, more complete”).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.7)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn plague the prose: “echo valley longing,” “confidently uncertain,” “wrestle his future,” and “symphony of possibilities” repeat with slight variation across adjacent paragraphs. The final third suffers from stacked abstractions (“resonant reconfiguration,” “charged poise”-adjacent phrasing) that flatten momentum. Sentence openings frequently recycle structure (“As…”, “He…”, “The…”), creating syntactic monotony. Figurative language becomes decorative rather than clarifying under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “reestablish the connection” appears three times; “balance” recurs without variation. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“drawing closer to the truth… taking shape like mist”). Figurative density is high but unpatterned—metaphors (web, nexus, droplets) don’t accumulate or pay off. Final paragraph uses template cadence (“She knew… she savored… she felt…”). Overwriting dulls momentum; key beats are summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrites key beats with stacked modifiers and repetitive conceptual phrasing (“flowed like the tides, adapting and changing…” followed by “flowing and ebbing like the tides”). Adjacent sentences paraphrase (“preserving wonder in routine… finding peace in the gentle, relentless passage of time”), creating loop artifacts. Figurative density is high but rarely advances causality; momentum stalls in descriptive accumulation. Final paragraph suffers from summary-over-scene, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive figurative phrasing (“latent radiance” x3, “resonant hush” x2) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “vessel for emotions” → “repository of secrets” → “key to unlocking desires”). Overwriting peaks in high-pressure beats: “whispers of those who had once cherished,” “confessions etched inside the spiral,” “stories etched into the pearl’s surface” use near-identical syntax and metaphor. Final third contains label-speak (“deep-seated motivation,” “sense of purpose”) that dulls closure impact. Sentence variety exists but rhythm becomes incantatory rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“forgiveness was not a destination, but a path” / “forgiveness is a map, not a destination”), and figurative density persists through high-pressure beats without payoff. Mixed metaphor logic (“whispers of the river... echoed in bathroom graffiti”) strains coherence. Final paragraphs loop conceptually (“paths she had taken, and those yet to come” → “wherever they may lead”), dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often beautiful but over-reliant on figurative density: “thrums of knowledge,” “cyclically reversed,” “unfolding cipher” recur without grounding mechanics. Adjacent sentences sometimes paraphrase (“determined to uncover its secrets” / “on a quest… to find”) and the final third leans on label-like emotional states (“cautious exuberance,” “newfound understanding”) rather than concrete action. Rhythm varies well, but purple patches obscure causality—e.g., how the watch measures “propagation delays” is never shown.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sentence-level craft is often vivid but marred by overwriting: stacked modifiers (“velvet observatory,” “crimson and gold,” “delicate china cup”) and repetitive conceptual phrasing (“threads of fate,” “labyrinthine path,” “web of possibilities”). The final paragraph loops through near-synonymous declarations of resolve without advancing knowledge or pressure. Figurative density obscures causality in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“kaleidoscope of colors,” “soaring melody”), risking figurative density in high-pressure beats. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“threshold of stillness” repeated without progression), but closure remains sharp and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.7)
    Repetitive phrasing (“Aria’s thoughts turned…”, “Aria felt…”) and synonym churn (“soothing,” “serene,” “peace”) create paraphrase loops. Overuse of figurative language (“scallop the clouds,” “vineyard hush”) without grounding muddles clarity—especially “scallop,” which appears three times but never demonstrates physical mechanics or consequence. Final paragraphs suffer from stacked abstractions (“cultivate her spirit,” “nurtured her soul”) that tell rather than show. Sentence openings vary moderately, but cadence becomes incantatory rather than propulsive, dulling momentum in high-reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing (“cloak of doubt,” “gray areas,” “sincerely insincere”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “complex web of fears... tangled together like threads”). Figurative density is high but often redundant: metaphors accumulate without advancing plot or character. Final third contains summary-heavy lines (“their work seemed to be done”) that dull momentum. Sentence openings vary, but cadence occasionally slips into templated lyricism (“As the sun rose... As they turned...”).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.3)
    Repetitive phrasing (“patterns in the pond,” “sycamore hush”) creates paraphrase loops. Figurative density overwhelms propulsion: nearly every sentence carries metaphor without pattern payoff. Mixed abstraction (“weave truth carefully,” “delayed revelation”) clashes with concrete imagery. Final paragraph stacks redundancies (“lesson would remain,” “lasting impression,” “stay with them forever”).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from paraphrase loops (“the skimmer remained… the skimmer sat… the skimmer’s resolve”) and redundant stems (“as the dust continued to fall” appears 4 times). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, key beats are summarized (“discerned the arrowhead’s story”) rather than dramatized. Final third repeats closure imagery without propulsion, dulling impact.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting mars momentum: phrases like “brilliant dimness,” “intricate web of energies,” and “lingering luminance” repeat with diminishing returns. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“renewed sense of purpose,” “deeper understanding,” “new sense of direction”). Figurative density peaks during the climax without pattern payoff, dulling the keystone’s impact. Strong verbs and varied syntax appear intermittently but don’t sustain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Line-level craft shows strong sensory detail but suffers from overwriting in high-pressure beats. Phrases like “meteor hush,” “labyrinthine corridors,” and “threads of sound and light” stack metaphors without grounding. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“shadows seemed to deepen… air grew thick… palpable energy”). Sentence variety is adequate, but propulsion stalls in reflective passages that summarize rather than dramatize discovery. Final paragraph leans on assertion over image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“the decision maker” opens six sentences), paraphrase loops (“understanding deepened… secrets uncovered… role in the grand drama”), and overuse of figurative density without payoff (“diamonds against velvet,” “essence of coins,” “wavelength align”). The final third accumulates scaffold: multiple sentences restate fulfillment, connection, and peace without advancing knowledge or pressure. These artifacts obscure emotional specificity and dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is largely evocative and rhythmic, but suffers from paraphrase loops (“echoes of sacrifice resonated… haunting melody… echo of sacrifice continued to resonate”) and stacked figurative language in high-pressure beats. Sentences often do double duty, yet some lines summarize emotion rather than embody it (“heart remained heavy”). Final paragraph verges on redundancy, slightly muddying the closure beat’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative language: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence carries metaphor (“kaleidoscope,” “nexus of plausible impossibility,” “ethereal light”), creating density without propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“rebuild what had been broken… restore the bell”; “mending the fabric… correcting the cosmic imbalance”). Final paragraph repeats “plausible impossibility” and “sapphire,” dulling closure impact. Elegant but slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“The warden’s thoughts turned to…” appears three times) and synonym churn (“resurfacing,” “re-emerging,” “unearthed”). Figurative density is high but often decorative—e.g., “beacon of the stories to come”—without advancing causality. Final paragraph repeats earlier images without intensification, dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from minor overwriting: stacked modifiers (“kaleidoscopic waterfall that danced with colors of the rainbow”), repetitive phrasing (“frozen dew crystal” appears four times), and paraphrase loops (e.g., “spark that ignited her passion” followed by “touch of wonder... drove her”). Sentence openings vary adequately, but peak beats occasionally blur under figurative density without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lyrical but over-ornamented: “soundless echo,” “ethereal glow,” “intricate dance of gears” recur without advancing pressure. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“revising… with precision” / “hands moved… with instinctual precision”). Final third suffers from conceptual redundancy—“burden,” “trust,” “journey” restated across three paragraphs. Figurative density slows momentum without payoff in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    Repetitive phrasing (“seemed to,” “felt a sense of”) and paraphrase loops dull momentum (e.g., “vivify his true self” / “bring to life through practice”). Elevated diction (“complementary opposites,” “resonant reconfiguration”) clashes with meditative simplicity. Figurative density spikes without payoff—“fabric of reality bending” contradicts the story’s otherwise grounded tone. Final paragraph restates earlier epiphanies without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“flow of ideas,” “flow through orthogonal approaches,” “thoughts flowing”) and near-synonym loops (“mystery,” “enigma,” “puzzle”). Figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without payoff (“absorb the light,” “storm-born silence”), creating density without propulsion. Final paragraph contains scaffolded summary (“exhausted but fulfilled,” “symbol of the mystery”) that dulls closure’s impact. Read-aloud rhythm falters in mid-section due to parallel constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose is dense with figurative language but plagued by paraphrase loops (“the final grain slips through the hourglass” repeated verbatim), mixed metaphors (“macerated the silence”), and scaffolded redundancy (“haunting melody… true haunting… haunting melody”). Sentence openings vary little, creating a drumbeat cadence. Closure is dulled by ornamental phrasing rather than sharpened by precision.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors stack (“ethereal tentacles,” “morbid perfume,” “foggy lucidity”) without pattern-teaching, dulling peak beats. Repetitive constructions (“as she walked… as she waited…”) create mild cadence loops. The line “interiorize exteriors” is conceptually muddy and unexplained. Despite strong imagery, information density suffers from abstraction over action, especially in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is often overwritten: metaphors stack without pattern-teaching (“charred dreams,” “frozen bloom,” “crucible of transformation”), creating figurative muddle in peak beats. Repetitive phrasing (“broken crozier” x3, “ember nexus” x4) and synonym churn (“refining a process to distill… harness… reshape”) dull momentum. The final paragraph suffers from summary (“gamble had paid off,” “true calling”) instead of concrete image. Sentence variety exists, but rhythm stalls during atmospheric exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from overwriting: stacked modifiers (“serenely electric atmosphere,” “otherworldly glow”), repetitive conceptual phrasing (“hidden truth,” “shard of hush”), and near-paraphrase loops (e.g., “uncover its source” / “uncover the hidden truth”). Figurative density persists through high-pressure beats without pattern payoff. Final paragraphs dilute momentum with summary instead of charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: stacked modifiers (“spectral beauty of the grotto,” “starlight-filled sky”), repetitive cadence (“As she walked… As she worked…”), and paraphrase loops (“shifting, flowing like the sands… ride the tide”). Figurative density overwhelms propulsion in the final third, with mixed metaphors (“permanent transient-ness,” “fabric of reality”) muddying clarity. Strong verbs are buried under weak nominalizations (“determination wash over her”).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“sinew thread seemed to pulse with a life of its own… imbuing exhibits with deeper truth”). Repetition of phrases like “texture of connection” and “ever-shifting landscape” creates synonym loops. Figurative density peaks without payoff—kaleidoscope, vortex, eruption recur without deepening. Final paragraph suffers paraphrase-loop: “thread trailing… world erupting… texture remaining.”

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive conceptual loops: “unfolded horizons,” “uncharted territories,” “mysteries waiting to be unraveled” reappear with near-identical phrasing across paragraphs. Figurative density is high but often vague (“attune oneself to subtle harmonics,” “threshold to infinite possibilities”) without grounding in concrete action. Final third contains summary-heavy lines (“students were ready to take on the challenge”) that tell rather than dramatize. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory without pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: “mystical realm,” “otherworldly silence,” “reeling hush” risk abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“faint pulses… pulses growing fainter”). Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., mist “responding” to words) borders on purple without payoff. Final paragraph’s “memory, a reminder…” echoes earlier phrasing redundantly.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentence variety supports momentum, with strong verbs (“navigated,” “reverberate,” “clutched”) and selective sensory detail. Some redundancy appears (“codex clutched tightly… codex still clutched”), and the phrase “crashing hush” repeats without evolution. Figurative density peaks appropriately during phase travel, though “deafening roar that filled her entire being” verges on abstraction. No fatal loops or scaffold, but minor paraphrase softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats—e.g., “glow with an otherworldly light,” “essence of the digital ghost,” “heartbeats of the universe”—creating slight muddle. Minor paraphrase loops: “midnight solace” appears three times with diminishing returns. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence becomes rhythmic to the point of predictability in the final third. Closure image (“fragments falling like snowflakes”) is strong, though slightly undercut by preceding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“cacophony that had been echoing… for centuries,” “kinetic sculpture that seemed to reverberate”). Minor paraphrase loops appear (“patterns that underlay the world… patterns in the flock’s flight”). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, the final paragraph repeats motifs without propulsion, dulling closure momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“felt a sense of…”) and conceptual redundancy (“strange and wondrous journey,” “familiar and strange”). Metaphors clash (“frostbitten hope” vs. “gravitationally playful”) without coherence, and elevated diction (“metamorphose,” “resonant reconfiguration”) jars against the cryptid-researcher POV. Final paragraph loops through summary (“darkness still loomed… no longer alone… frostbitten hope”) without propulsion or fresh detail.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is musical and dense, but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “weaving a spell of tranquility,” “vibrating with renewed vitality” verge on abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops (“music drifted… music reached… music signaling”) repeat concepts without pressure gain. Final paragraph avoids scaffold, yet some figurative language (“deep well of wonder”) feels generic. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, but information density dips in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is vivid and largely efficient, with strong verbs (“sorted,” “raged,” “diverted”) and selective sensory detail. However, adjacent sentences occasionally paraphrase (“the tempest inside raged on… seemed to pulse”; “delicate dance… required precision”), triggering minor loop penalties. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph suffers slight overwriting (“beacon of hope in the brittle hush”), though clarity remains intact. No scaffold or momentum drag severe enough to cap high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from overwriting: “misting hush,” “whispering gleam,” “haunting lullaby” recur with near-synonymic redundancy. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“silence as possibility,” “quest to hear the unheard”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, the final paragraph’s wind bells “whisper a promise” edges into thematic echo. Momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive loops rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“branches of an ancient, gnarled tree,” “analog memories infused with vibrant energy”). Minor paraphrase loops exist (e.g., “steadfast and alone” repeated). Figurative density is high, yet mostly coherent. The final paragraph risks abstraction (“richer, more wondrous place”), slightly dulling the closure image. Otherwise, line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lush but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing (“cipher of longing,” “luminous absence,” “runaway dream”) across adjacent lines, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff, risking purple prose. Sentence openings vary, but cadence becomes incantatory to the point of monotony (“Elian would… Elian’s… Elian felt…”). The final third retains elevated diction that clashes with the absence of dramatized crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor (“withered fingers,” “mist dispersing,” “symphony”), risking purple overload. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“guided by… luminescence”; “searching for a specific landmark or signal”). Final paragraph’s “magic that lay just beyond the reach of the everyday” edges into generic uplift. Yet rhythm modulates well, and information density remains high—each line advances atmosphere or action without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is evocative but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “unlock secrets,” “follow the thread,” “uncharted,” “mystery and wonder” recur with diminishing returns. The final paragraph stacks near-synonymous declarations (“resolve,” “determination,” “great discovery”) that summarize rather than dramatize. Sentence rhythm is generally strong, though figurative density occasionally blurs propulsion in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but precise, with high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mystery. Figurative language is consistent (shadow as topography, leaves as creatures) and never muddled. Minor overwriting in mid-section (“wrestling with the very fabric of reality”) edges toward abstraction, but recovers swiftly. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final paragraph’s rhythm perfectly mirrors earned stillness, though one near-redundancy (“hush… wrapped like a shroud”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting plagues key beats: metaphors stack without coherence (“shimmering veil,” “fabric of reality,” “pulsing current”), blurring sense. Paraphrase loops abound—e.g., “succor the parched earth” appears twice with near-identical phrasing. Figurative density peaks during the spell-weaving without pattern-teaching, dulling impact. Final paragraph repeats “wonder,” “magic,” and “threshold” redundantly, sacrificing propulsion for ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: “interlaced hush” repeats six times, “tapestry needle glinted” appears twice with minimal variation, and metaphors like “silence accumulated… a heavy, velvety stillness” verge on purple. Adjacent lines often paraphrase (“unravel the knots” / “unwinding of the net”). These loops dull momentum and obscure causal clarity in peak beats, disqualifying high-band excellence despite strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished but suffers from mild overwriting: adjacent lines restate concepts (“whispers that echoed through its stones” / “whispered chapel’s echoes”), and figurative density occasionally blurs propulsion (“threshold beyond which the cartographer’s art gave way to speculation”). No syntactic monotony, but filter verbs (“felt,” “sensed”) cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. Final paragraph’s momentum falters with summary (“world full of secrets”) rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“sophisticated sorrow,” “tenuous at best”), risking therapy-speak. Sentence rhythm varies well, though mid-story paragraphs lean on repetitive syntactic structures (“I... I... I...”). The snow globe’s reappearance avoids paraphrase loops, but the phrase “physics of letting go” recurs without evolution. Closure image is clean, though “bright, cold air” feels generic after rich underwater detail.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented: phrases like “ghost in code” and “tinkersong wonder” border on coined jargon, and figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“swirling mist” / “mist swirled”; “encode a message” / “messages encoded”). Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood. However, the final paragraph’s “testament to the power of creative expression” edges toward abstract telling, dulling the otherwise concrete closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and atmospheric density. However, recurring phrases (“icebound spire,” “airship captain’s goggles”) verge on motif repetition without functional payoff, and some passages summarize emotion rather than embody it (“heart filled with peace”). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines restating thematic ideas (e.g., sanctuary/prison duality). No severe artifacts, but slight overwriting in peak beats dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from paraphrase loops (“the clouds outside were now… their emotions turbulent”; later “clouds… responding to her mood”) and stacked abstractions (“spooled wholeness,” “fabric of reality seemed to unravel”). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled—e.g., “empty spaces remembered” is repeated without grounding. Final third contains label-only feelings (“sense of peace,” “heart swelled”) that tell rather than embody. Momentum stalls in reflective passages lacking propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is vivid and often multi-functional (“dappled shadows,” “fractally precise renderings”), but occasional overwriting dulls propulsion: “meticulous efforts of a scholar's guild,” “faint, swirling patterns that danced across the surface.” No paraphrase loops, but two adjacent sentences restate the artist’s absorption near climax. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Closure image remains sharp despite slight syntactic uniformity in mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence structure, concrete nouns, strong verbs (“coaxed,” “discern,” “charted”). Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor overwriting appears in stacked descriptors (“faint, shimmering light,” “warm glow”), but no paraphrase loops or scaffold. The phrase “sociable isolation” stands out as slightly academic for the voice, but doesn’t obscure clarity. Overall, prose supports momentum without artifact drag.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and sensory density. But overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “hauntingly bright surfaces... infused with an otherworldly essence” stacks modifiers without advancing plot. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“gazed out... stepped into... made their way” echoes movement without new pressure). Final paragraph suffers slight abstraction (“larger machinery... flow of time itself”), dulling the closure image’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “kaleidoscope of colorful creatures” and “brambled hope” verge on ornamental abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“thriving community… shared sense of purpose and belonging”). Sentence rhythm is generally strong, though some passages lean on passive constructions (“had been created,” “began to sense”). No scaffold errors, but figurative density slightly dulls momentum in mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrought: “pane of hush,” “time’s final ripple,” and “bruised awe” recur with diminishing returns. Figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments without payoff, risking purple prose. Paraphrase loops appear (“fragile balance… beautifully flawed fabric… fragility at the heart”); “hush” is restated six times with minimal variation. Final paragraph’s scaffold (“stood… turned… footsteps echoed”) feels templated. These artifacts dull closure’s impact, disqualifying 9+ despite strong rhythm elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from mild overwriting: “weight of her task settling heavy,” “smell of old books and decay,” “graceless beauty” verge on stock phrasing. The phrase “offhandedly exact” is jarringly abstract amid concrete action. No severe loops, but “mechanical birds… watched… wings beating… circled” repeats motion without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought (“symphonically minded ears,” “intricate networks of fibers that formed the foam were not unlike…”). Minor paraphrase loops exist (“pieces began to fall into place” → “as the pieces continued to fall into place”), and figurative density in the climax slightly dulls propulsion. No scaffold or simultaneity errors, but sentence openings lack full rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“glimmering parole,” “hidden narratives,” “glass orchard”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple sentences restating Ember’s sense of connection). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddled—“quantifying absence” is evocative but undefined, and “mindfully scattered” recurs without concrete manifestation. Sentence openings vary adequately, but cadence becomes hypnotic to the point of stasis, dulling narrative propulsion in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing lines that echo (“damp from the rain”). However, repetitive phrasing (“memories… began to flow/flood into her”) and stacked abstractions (“remorse that had been stored… was still present, but no longer jagged”) dull immediacy in peak beats. No fatal artifacts, but minor overwriting prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting plagues peak beats: stacked modifiers (“majestic presence,” “timeless embodiment”), mixed metaphors (“rusty heart beating with purpose”), and paraphrase loops (“beloved landmark… attracting visitors” → “marvel… attracting visitors”). Final paragraph suffers thematic echo (“vigorous tender hope” restates prior abstractions). Sentence rhythm grows monotonous in dialogue sections, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“fragmented and disjointed… weave disparate threads”), and metaphors multiply without coherence (“helix-minded,” “synaptic plasticity,” “entangled memories” blend scientific and poetic registers awkwardly). The phrase “chaotically precise mind” appears as label, not demonstrated behavior. Final paragraphs sag with summary (“experience had changed her… newfound sense of purpose”) instead of image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but exhibits mild overwriting: stacked modifiers (“mystifying occurrence,” “otherworldly material”) and repetitive phrasing (“twisting passages,” “winding tunnels”). Sentence openings vary adequately, yet figurative density in key beats (“latent blaze,” “fabric of reality became permeable”) risks muddling physical stakes. No fatal artifacts, but minor scaffold (“she had been studying… she had come…”) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“coax music from the very essence of the wood”). Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent. No paraphrase loops, but slight scaffold in lines like “The sculptor's task was to reweave...” followed by near-restatement. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, though “quiet heartbeat” risks cliché. Momentum sustained, but two adjacent sentences restate the insulator’s role (lines 12–13), triggering minor loop penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but overwrought: figurative density (“mystical glow,” “palpable silence,” “otherworldly energy”) repeats without payoff, creating scaffold loops. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“solitude… new perspective,” “hope amidst melancholy… hopeful melancholy”). Final third suffers from cumulative abstraction that dulls propulsion. Strong opening and closing lines, but mid-section bloats with redundant lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but over-ornamented; figurative density blurs propulsion in high-pressure beats. Phrases like “the air was charged with an almost theatrical sincerity” and “fabric of reality was being woven anew” verge on purple prose. Repetition of “silence,” “stillness,” and “resonance” creates synonym churn without deepening. Final paragraph loops conceptually (“quiet,” “stillness,” “peace”) without advancing stakes or image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: phrases like “wildflower hush,” “ebb and flow of her thoughts,” and “heartbeat of the natural world” stack modifiers without clarifying meaning. Paraphrase loops occur (“serenity within motion” repeated; “undercurrent of wisdom” echoed four times). The climax suffers from figurative muddle—“beautiful and terrifying” fragrance carrying “essence of the forest” lacks concrete sensory grounding. Final paragraph reads like a synopsis, not a resonant image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery (“tendrils curling like ethereal fingers,” “dancing on the solar winds”). But adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“accelerated growth and possibility” after “trail of accelerated growth”) and figurative density spikes in the climax without payoff (“whirling silence, a cacophony of sound that was somehow quiet”). Sentence openings vary adequately, though some cadence becomes predictable in mid-story. No fatal artifacts, but minor overwriting dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and strong opening/closing imagery. But repetitive phrasing appears (“singular convergence” echoed without development; “rapidly adapting” used as label); the phrase “hazy precision” is introduced late as a thematic tag without prior textual embodiment. Minor scaffold exists in transitions (“As she worked…”, “As she continued…”), and the final paragraph loops back to earlier motifs without deepening them.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: metaphors pile without pattern-teaching (“sculpted hush,” “prism-song,” “amber music sheet”), creating density without propulsion. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“the memory… lingered,” “a testament…”, “haunting reminder…”), triggering loop penalties. Final third relies on summary (“Elian knew…”) rather than dramatization, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from overwriting: “avalanchingly quiet” appears twice as a strained modifier; “canyon hush” repeats without deepening. Adjacent lines paraphrase (“silence… avalanchingly quiet,” “stillness… heart of the universe”). Figurative density peaks during the flute’s play but lacks variation in sentence structure, creating a drumbeat rhythm. The phrase “harvest insights from failure” reads as thematic label-speak rather than character-specific idiom, dulling immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with evocative imagery but occasionally overwrought—phrases like “kaleidoscope of emotions that seemed to shift and writhe like a living thing” verge on purple prose. A paraphrase loop appears: “driven by a sense of urgency and curiosity” followed by “feverish intensity, as if driven by a force beyond their control.” These artifacts slightly dull the closure beat but don’t obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-dense: phrases like “germinating a sense of connection” and “fade from memory to myth” verge on metaphorical abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops occur (“vibrations… hum… vibrations… hum”) and the final paragraph repeats “magic that lay just beneath the surface” in slightly varied form. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) occasionally drifts from Eira’s courier pragmatism into editorial lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is dense with figurative language but often redundant (“shrouded in mist that obscured,” “faint light that filtered”) and conceptually repetitive—multiple sentences restate the mystic’s attunement or the world’s emotional saturation. Mixed metaphors (“anchor that kept her tethered,” “spirit soared”) blur physical logic. Final paragraph loops through near-synonymous claims about “truth” and “mystery” without propulsion. Elevated register persists in peak beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff (“stoically sparkling thread,” “hush of time’s unraveling tapestry,” “raveling silence”). Paraphrase loops occur (“recommence the connection… reweave the fabric… carry her message”), and key concepts are restated abstractly rather than advanced. Final paragraphs suffer from synonym churn (“resolve,” “determination,” “resolute,” “latent sacrifice”). High information density is offset by repetitive cadence and stacked modifiers that blur propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought: “patterns seeming to shift and writhe like living things” and “surge of azure defiance” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“patience and focus” / “patience, persistence”). Sentence openings vary adequately, but figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats, dulling momentum. Crucially, no artifacts obscure causality or closure—but the final third’s elevated diction (“azure defiance,” “shape our own destiny”) slightly distances emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally polished but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“map maker’s thoughts turned to…”, “map maker felt…”) and overuse of filter verbs (“she felt,” “she saw,” “she sensed”). Key beats are summarized rather than dramatized (“she uncovered the secret”), dulling momentum. Figurative language is consistent but occasionally ornamental (“kaleidoscope of images”) without advancing causality. No syntactic monotony, but information density drops in the middle due to redundant emotional labels.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented—phrases like “luminescent ache” recur with near-metaphorical insistence, risking abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“sense of safety,” “feeling of safety”) and “glow” is used four times in varied contexts, slightly diluting impact. Still, sentence variety, concrete verbs (“nestled,” “plunging,” “stack”), and strong paragraph cadence maintain propulsion. The final image lands cleanly despite slight figurative density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“steer the dawn,” “Otherworldly routine,” “glass lantern” recur with minimal variation) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “the dawn was taking shape… coalescing from the darkness” appears twice). Figurative density is high in calm beats but lacks propulsion; sentences often describe rather than advance. Final third contains scaffold-like restatements that dull momentum without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“iridescent caution” appears three times, “valley-mist wonder” twice) and near-synonym loops (“mesmerizing,” “intricate beauty,” “ethereal glow”). Figurative density is high without pattern payoff—light metaphors accumulate but don’t evolve causally. Final paragraph contains paraphrase loops (“drifting on a sea of wonder” / “ride the currents”) that soften closure impact. Momentum stalls in reflective passages lacking micro-choice anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: “sorrow was not just a feeling, but a quantifiable force,” “machinery of the universe,” “intricate tapestry” verge on abstraction. Adjacent lines repeat concepts (“journey… journey of discovery,” “moon’s gentle light… moon’s light continued to guide”). Final paragraph loops through “moon,” “labyrinth,” “secrets” without propulsion. Closure image is dulled by cumulative lyric redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is overwritten: metaphors crowd nearly every sentence (“threads of woven dawns,” “swaddle of sound,” “beacon of hope”) without payoff, creating figurative bloat. Repetition abounds—“woven dawns” appears four times, “mica window” five—with diminishing returns. Paraphrase loops occur (“the realm could be rekindled… magic rekindled”; “knitting communities… connected once more”). Final paragraphs suffer from summary over scene, dulling closure impact with declarative resolution instead of earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally polished with varied sentence structure and sensory specificity, but exhibits minor overwriting: “whispers of forgotten knowledge,” “musty scent of old books” verge on stock lyricism. A paraphrase loop appears in lines describing Elys’s balance (“physically present, yet emotionally detached… delicate balance… adept at it”). Figurative density is consistent but not overwhelming; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph flows well, though “within arm’s reach of midnight” is reused without fresh inflection, slightly dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: phrases like “creeping normality noticer” and “heuristically gentle” feel coined for texture, not clarity. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“sipping tea and savoring the bread” repeats near-identically). The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than deepening image, dulling closure impact. Sentence variety is strong, but some modifiers (“delicate structure,” “quiet reverence”) verge on generic. No fatal artifacts, but slight overwriting softens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: metaphors accumulate without pattern payoff (“quartz hush,” “sentinels,” “canvas waiting to be filled”). Repetitive phrasing (“faded to memory,” “edge of oblivion”) and near-synonym loops (“whispers,” “lullaby,” “farewell”) create scaffold drag. Final paragraph suffers from stacked modifiers and conceptual redundancy (“weaver of the threads that bound the past to the present”). Read-aloud rhythm falters under density.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is competent but marred by paraphrase loops (“fragile peace,” “fragile sense of understanding”) and redundant intensifiers (“palpable tension,” “living, breathing thing”). Overuse of filter verbs (“Lena saw,” “Lena felt”) dulls immediacy. Final paragraph drifts into thematic summary rather than concrete image. No severe artifacts, but momentum sags in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and sensory details are woven into action (“closed her eyes, focusing on subtle changes in taste”). However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “spectral light,” “futuristic nostalgia,” “terrestrially cosmic” strain clarity. Minor paraphrase loops (“the world around her was alive… the air was filled with whispers”) dilute propulsion. Final paragraph suffers from summary-telling rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in key moments: “auroral sorrow,” “uncorking of a bottle sealed too long,” and “painting with something behind it” verge on purple abstraction. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“forgotten lines and misremembered faces”; “suppressed creativity begin to lift… uncorking”). Figurative density peaks during high-pressure beats without payoff, dulling emotional precision at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought (“labyrinth of forgotten memories and decaying infrastructure”). Minor paraphrase loops appear (“painstaking… driven by curiosity… desire to uncover truth”). Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though some cadences verge on templated lyricism (“As she walked… As she read…”). Closure image is clear but slightly generic in its epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: “symphonies of truth,” “whispers of truth,” “language of the heart” repeat with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates (“As the... Aria’s... The...”) across adjacent sentences, creating drumbeat monotony. Figurative density is high but incoherent—“glisten,” “resonate,” “vibrate” used interchangeably without physical logic. Final third is bloated with restatements that dull closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “inner static,” “fragmented wholeness,” and “miniaturize the chaos” recur with minimal variation, creating synonym loops. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats (“flames were strangely organic… living, breathing entity”) without payoff, bordering on overwriting. The final paragraph restates earlier ideas (“still an android… but also something more”) without advancing momentum, violating the paragraph cut test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“tranquility was disrupted… serenity had been disrupted”), synonym churn (“discerning eye… method of gathering”), and therapy-speak (“healing power of listening”). Figurative language is sparse but strained (“sandstorm calm” introduced late without setup). Key beats are summarized (“she spent the next few days reading…”) rather than dramatized, dulling momentum. Final paragraph repeats “courtyard” and “peace” redundantly.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive scaffolding: phrases like “mysterious familiarity,” “calm defiance,” and “intricate patterns” recur without progression, creating paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but undifferentiated—nearly every sentence contains metaphor, blurring focus in peak moments. The final paragraph repeats opening imagery verbatim (“air thick with saltwater and decay”), signaling stasis rather than closure. Sentence rhythm lacks variation, leaning heavily on comma-spliced lyrical cadences that dull propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled; sentences vary in length and structure, avoiding monotony. High information density: “gleaming silence,” “crystalline structures refracted the dim light,” “gravity began to distort and ripple” each advance atmosphere, character, and concept. One paraphrase loop: “pockets of gravity seemed to be pulling them… sensation growing stronger” echoes prior lines. No scaffold or purple prose; figurative language serves cohesion. Final paragraph’s cadence elegantly circles back to lanterns, earning its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrought: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“smooth the hush,” “deepened into a tranquil blaze,” “smoothing the hush”). Figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching payoff—“tranquil blaze” contradicts established serenity. Template cadence appears in action sequences (“hands moved… tracing… weaving”). Final paragraph loops motifs without new pressure, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence variety and sensory layering. But recurring figurative phrases (“twinkling lights,” “magical glow,” “otherworldly light”) verge on redundancy, and the meteor shower motif is over-ornamented without advancing plot. No syntactic monotony, yet the final paragraph stacks abstract nouns (“wonder,” “mysteries,” “connection”) that dilute momentum. Crucially, no loops or scaffold sentences mar clarity, and the closing image lands cleanly—though the seal’s “glow” risks violating established realism without prior magical cues.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops (“whispers… serenade… song… resonance”) and stacked modifiers (“tragically radiant beauty,” “ethereal ballerinas”). Adjacent sentences often restate the same idea: “The seashell’s song was a key… unlocking a door…” followed by “unravel, revealing a tangled web…” Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed,” “realized”) dull immediacy. The final third is dense with redundant affirmations (“stronger,” “tempered,” “ready”), slowing momentum without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but over-embellished: “pearl twilight hue,” “aurora’s gentle light danced,” “wisely enduring” recur with diminishing returns. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct” appears verbatim twice). Figurative density peaks in calm beats, not pressure moments, avoiding major muddle—but synonym churn (“narrative,” “text,” “document”) and templated cadence (“As she… As the…”) dull propulsion. Final paragraph loops closure redundantly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density without propulsion. Repetitive phrasing (“whispers of the land,” “hum of the universe,” “webs of intrigue”) loops conceptually without deepening. Mixed metaphors (“canyons of the soul,” “spider’s web in morning dew”) blur clarity. Final paragraphs suffer from synonym churn (“sorrowful and redemptive,” “haunting and beautiful”) that dilutes emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: metaphors stack without coherence (“hull cracked open like a broken shell,” “dreams played like a never-ending film reel,” “windows of connection”), creating figurative density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops recur—e.g., “salvage something pure from the wreckage” appears verbatim twice—and “borrowed starlight” repeats as tonal refrain without deepening. Final paragraph suffers scaffold bloat (“mysteries,” “darkness,” “guidance,” “connections”) that summarizes theme instead of crystallizing image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is polished but overwrought: adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“soothing serenade” / “soothing melody”; “hidden patterns” x4). Figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity” feel like lexical ornaments). Final paragraph loops motifs without propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm falters in mid-story due to syntactic similarity across descriptive clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clear but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“Aria… Aria… Aria…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “uncover the truth” / “excavate the truth” / “uncover the facts”). Figurative language is sparse, but key moments default to cliché (“branches creaking ominously,” “beacon in the darkness”). The final paragraph’s cadence lacks propulsion, summarizing epiphany rather than dramatizing it with concrete, idiosyncratic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: near-identical sentence stems (“As she…”, “The visionary…”) recur, and figurative language appears in nearly every line without pattern payoff. Key beats are summarized (“watched as the prophet’s influence grew”) rather than dramatized. Synonym churn (“unfold the narrative,” “shape the narrative,” “guide the course of history”) creates paraphrase loops. The final paragraph reads like a thematic checklist, dulling momentum and closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-embellished: “feral loft’s grimy windows like a hesitant lover” mixes metaphors (feral vs. loverly). Minor paraphrase loops (“silence had grown oppressive… words had come less readily”) and stacked modifiers (“red-rimmed from the night’s wine”) dilute momentum. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports emotional beats. Closure lines avoid purple prose, but mid-story density slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive phrasing (“ethereal” x3, “vibrational frequency,” “deep sense”) and paraphrase loops dull momentum (“resonance... vibrational frequency... sonic signature”). Figurative density is high but incoherent—“fleshly ethereal” contradicts itself, and “logic/emotion” duality is told, not shown. Final paragraph’s scaffold (“remained vigilant… always ready”) adds redundancy without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“she had been waiting… ever since the lake had frozen”; “the people would rise up, unyoking themselves”) and stacked figurative language without payoff (“magnetic viaduct,” “burning silver orb,” “ethereal glow”). Key beats are summarized (“the revolution had begun”) rather than dramatized, dulling propulsion. Sentence openings vary, but rhythmic momentum stalls in mid-story due to repetitive clause structures (“The mapper knew…”, “She felt…”). The final third contains ornamental description that doesn’t advance pressure or character.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetitive sentence stems (“Maya felt…”, “Maya’s mind…”) and paraphrase loops dilute propulsion (“untangle the threads of entangled memories” → “memories… began to untangle”). Figurative density is high but coherent; however, therapy-speak (“fortified vulnerability,” “shedding a skin”) intrudes in peak beats. Final paragraph suffers from conceptual redundancy (“freedom she had discovered” / “no longer controlled by them”). Strong opening and closing images, but mid-section bloats with summary over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting abounds: “gentle ticking of intricate mechanisms,” “soft whirring of delicate gears,” “poignant reminder,” “vibrant hush” recur with near-synonym churn. Figurative density is high but unpatterned—metaphors stack without payoff (“storm clouds,” “broken mechanisms,” “harmony”). Template cadence appears in reflective passages (“As he pondered… he began to see…”). Final paragraph suffers paraphrase loops (“sense of hope and renewal,” “sense of peace,” “sense of purpose”).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“steadily curious,” “irreverent awe” recur without deepening) and template cadence (“As X, Y” opens multiple sentences). Figurative language is dense but often decorative—“yearning algorithm,” “unheard ringing”—without grounding in physical logic or causal pressure. Key moments like the bell-ringing climax are summarized rather than dramatized, sacrificing propulsion for abstraction. Sentence variety exists, but momentum stalls in repetitive reflective beats that lack micro-turns.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“Lena’s obsession… Lena became convinced… Lena’s search had become”) and redundant abstractions (“haunting sense of absence,” “void left by lost loved ones”). Figurative language is frequent but often generic (“labyrinth of servers,” “ghostly signature”). The final paragraph repeats motifs without deepening them, creating a circular cadence that substitutes for resolution. Information density is low in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwritten: metaphors accumulate without pattern payoff (“shadow-laced,” “pen and ink drawing,” “map of the soul”), creating density without propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“reconstitute the crystal, to restore its wholeness”; “fragile balance could be maintained… heal the fractures, to restore the balance”). Final paragraph repeats “whispers of the frozen sea” and “weighted breath,” dulling closure impact. Still, rhythm and imagery remain evocative and largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is often beautiful but overwrites in key beats: “windborne solace,” “fold in patience,” and “sound of approaching endings” repeat as near-synonym loops. Template cadence appears in shovel/hauled/broke sequences. Figurative density in the final third dulls propulsion—peace is asserted more than dramatized. Strong opening and closing lines, but mid-section sags under redundant lyrical phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (“destined mismatches… souls meant to be together yet forever apart”), creating loop artifacts. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff, blurring focus. Register drift occurs in peak beats (“intersubjective understanding”)—a phrase alien to lived experience. Final paragraphs repeat “destined mismatches” and “passionate subtlety” like incantations, dulling momentum rather than crystallizing insight.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    Severe paraphrase loops plague the text: “sense of stillness,” “deep sense of responsibility,” “sense of pride,” “sense of peace” repeat with near-identical phrasing. Figurative density is high but static—“whisperfield calm,” “conjured clearing,” “kinetic parapet” recur without evolution. Final third suffers scaffold bloat (“they would continue to… they would tend… they would carry…”), dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is polished but suffers from paraphrase loops (“sense of peace settle over her” appears twice nearly verbatim) and redundant affirmations of tranquility. Figurative language is consistent but overused in high-density patches without payoff, creating decorative stasis rather than propulsion. Final third repeats motifs without deepening, dulling closure impact through echo rather than evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally over-figured (“weathered innocence seemed to stir, like a creature awakening”). Minor redundancy in describing silence (“oppressive,” “suspended hush,” “amplify the silence”) edges toward paraphrase loop. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph’s “symphony of new beginnings” slightly veers into abstraction but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought: “hush of old videotapes left unwatched” appears twice verbatim, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high yet coherent, though “palpable entity,” “ethereal fingers,” and “gentle heartbeat” verge on mixed metaphor. Final paragraph’s repetition of “sound of growing older” dulls closure’s impact; tighter compression would heighten resonance without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    Repetitive phrasing (“Eli… Eli…”) and paraphrase loops dilute momentum (e.g., “defying the laws of physics” / “changelessly constant in its motion”). Figurative language is dense but unanchored (“luminous ache,” “fabric of the world torn apart”), creating abstraction over concrete propulsion. Final paragraphs stack thematic assertions instead of crystallizing image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“pulsing stillness,” “hymning the mundane”), risking abstraction in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“soft hum of gentle choirs” / “soft murmur of other patients”; “fragrance that wafted” / “scent… wafted”). Sentence openings vary well, and information density is high, but “decisively kind” and “execute a flawless goodbye” verge on label-speak. Closure beat remains clear despite slight figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is competent but suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“Lyra was…”, “She…”) and paraphrase loops (e.g., restating the key’s significance across adjacent paragraphs). Figurative language is sparse but coherent; however, momentum stalls in mid-story exposition dumps (“Her research focused on…”). The final paragraph recycles earlier phrasing (“clockwork automaton key… mysteries ahead”) without cadence shift or propulsion, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.0)
    Repetitive phrasing (“sense of…”) and paraphrase loops weaken propulsion—e.g., “feeling a sense of clarity emerge… felt a sense of purpose begin to take shape… felt herself becoming more grounded.” Figurative density is high but often static (“spark of curiosity,” “cleft in certainty”) without advancing causality. Final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions that dull emotional specificity. Sentence variety exists, but momentum stalls in reflective stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is lush but suffers from figurative density without payoff: metaphors like “zephyr bloom,” “reflectively vibrant,” and “bubbles rising” recur without evolving meaning. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“gentle luminescence… soft, inner light… zephyr bloom”) creating loop-like redundancy. While rhythm is controlled, the high frequency of elevated diction in every beat dulls propulsion and approaches purple prose in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“honeyed hush,” “raw edges,” “slowly unfolding peace”), stacking modifiers where specificity would deepen impact. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“serene landscape” / “quiet and the green”; “healing” repeated four times in closing paragraphs). Sentence openings vary adequately, but figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats, violating the overwriting check. Still, momentum holds, and the final image lands with clarity despite slight inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers dense overwriting: 70% of sentences in high-pressure beats deploy figurative language without pattern payoff (“swirling hush,” “feral nexus,” “shapes of different hopes”). Paraphrase loops abound (“words flowed… words began to flow once more”; “turmoil… struggling… unable to make progress”). Mixed metaphors (“swimming against the current” vs. “thread of imagination”) dilute coherence. Final paragraph repeats “mist swirled” verbatim from opening, creating scaffold redundancy without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-embellished: adjacent lines often restate mood (“gathering hush,” “expectant hush”) or rely on stacked modifiers (“haunting, lilting tune,” “deep, rich tones”). Figurative density peaks in high-pressure moments without pattern payoff—e.g., “golden stories,” “sacred practices,” “forgotten songs” recur as labels, not charged particulars. Final paragraph suffers minor paraphrase loop (“spin new golden stories… weave the threads”), dulling closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lush but occasionally over-ornamented (“morbid perfume,” “safekept starlight” repeated). Minor paraphrase loops: “stillness so profound it felt as though the world was holding its breath” echoed later. Figurative density peaks during high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching payoff, slightly dulling propulsion. Still, rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraphing. However, recurring phrases like “harvest of echoes” and “cellar of reason” verge on motif-as-mantra without functional payoff. Minor overwriting appears in high-density beats (“residual energy of past events was rumored to be ripe for the gathering”), where abstraction dulls immediacy. No fatal loops, but slight redundancy in describing Elian’s attunement across weeks/months reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: metaphors accumulate without functional payoff (“fractal weaver,” “whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush” feel coined for texture, not causality). Repetitive constructions (“the weaver... the weaver...”) and near-paraphrase loops dull momentum (e.g., “serene world” / “tranquility of the setting”). Final third suffers from figurative density without propulsion—language decorates rather than drives. Read-aloud rhythm falters under stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally vivid but suffers from mild overwriting: phrases like “hauntingly practical truth” and “crystallized time” verge on label-speak. A paraphrase loop appears in “contain the swirling emotions… channel it into something tangible… contain the pain,” dulling momentum. Sentence openings vary well, but figurative density occasionally blurs cause/effect in peak beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought (“regret hung in the air, a palpable mist”), risking purple patches. Some paraphrase loops exist: “fragments of stories… snippets of conversations… whispers” repeat conceptually without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density in peak beats (e.g., “shroud,” “embers,” “ghost”) borders on stacked metaphor without payoff. Final image is strong, though the line “testament to the power of stillness” edges into declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues high-pressure beats: figurative density (“symbols danced… like a living thing,” “air alive with gentle thrum”) repeats without payoff. Paraphrase loops abound (“restore… bring back… resurrect”; “possibility… hope… rebirth”). Template cadence in final paragraph (“Maya walked… terminal hummed… sextant glowed…”) dulls closure. Strong verbs are buried under modifiers; momentum stalls in descriptive stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is polished but overwritten: figurative density peaks in calm moments (“crystal whispering forecourt,” “glacial hush”) yet thins at potential tension points. Repetitive phrasing (“excruciatingly gentle” twice, “petrichor nostalgia” twice) and paraphrase loops (“calming his thoughts and soothing his soul”) dull momentum. Final paragraph restates earlier ideas without propulsion. Elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “mundane routine”) occasionally exceeds the scribe’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting plagues key passages: stacked modifiers (“serene upheaval,” “thoughtfully clear understanding”), repetitive conceptual phrasing (“hidden patterns,” “tangled threads”), and therapy-speak labels (“false narratives,” “deep understanding”). The final paragraph suffers paraphrase loops (“silence... palpable presence,” “sense of peace... thoughtfully clear understanding”). Figurative density obscures propulsion; sentences often tell rather than show pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“the fog rolled on… shrouding the harbor in its damp, gray mist” echoes earlier lines) and paraphrase loops (“soothing sounds of the waves” → “ocean’s hush”). Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she noticed”) stack in reflective beats, dulling immediacy. Final paragraph overwrites with redundant closure (“secrets waiting… uncovered once more”), weakening propulsion. No syntactic variety in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in places: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“fragile connections,” “frayed strand,” “fragile, frayed connections”), and figurative density occasionally blurs clarity (“silence… vibrate with a quiet, otherworldly music”). Sentence openings vary well, but cadence becomes rhythmic to the point of predictability in the middle section. The final paragraph tightens effectively, though “vivid, descriptive snapshot” verges on self-referential label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: “bitterly sweet nostalgia wash over him, a longing for a time when the world was alive with music and color” verges on abstract summary. A paraphrase loop occurs in lines about the device humming and the egg pulsing—both described as “gentle, otherworldly” vibrations. These don’t obscure causality but slightly dilute the closure’s precision, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sentence-level propulsion and varied syntax. However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase (“sense of peace… sense of unyielding compassion”; “healing… growth… scars to sing”), creating minor redundancy loops. Figurative density is high but coherent—kelp-drift peace, charred bark, glinting coin—all serve motif. The final paragraph’s cadence is slightly over-composed, bordering on ornamental, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid but occasionally over-ornamented: “luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience,” and “defiant hush” recur as near-labels rather than dramatized traits. A paraphrase loop appears in “quiet confidence… luminous presence… defiant hush.” Final paragraph’s cadence swells effectively, though “triumphant cry” risks sentimentality. Information density is high, but figurative language occasionally stacks without propulsion (“kaleidoscope,” “tapestry,” “shimmering thread”).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“intricate web of relationships that bound the universe together”), risking figurative density without payoff. Repetition of “transit,” “patterns,” and “light” edges toward scaffold-looping, especially in the final third. Sentence openings vary well, but some passages summarize what could be dramatized (e.g., “felt a deepening connection”). Still, rhythm supports theme, and key images land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting abounds: metaphors pile without coherence (“serene gloom,” “summer storm” for ghost, “thundering calm”), creating figurative muddle. Repetitive phrasing (“the carver felt…”, “as she…”) and paraphrase loops dull momentum (e.g., grief described as “swirling,” then “shifting like a great wheel,” then “a shape”). Final paragraph summarizes closure instead of dramatizing it, violating “show pivotal beats” rule. Sentence variety exists, but density suffers from redundant emotional labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“pendulum bob… stately motion” repeated 4x), synonym churn (“stillness,” “calm,” “pause”), and template cadence (“As she… As the…”). Figurative density overwhelms peak beats without pattern payoff (e.g., “searing reverie that burned away doubts” clashes with otherwise muted tone). Final third drowns in abstractions (“balance,” “redemption,” “light”) that dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm falters under repetitive syntactic structures.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwritten: phrases like “uncharted echoes” and “shape of intentions” repeat without deepening, creating near-paraphrase loops. The final paragraph’s cadence suffers from stacked modifiers (“cobalt walls a comforting presence… celestial map guiding them”) that blur propulsion with ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but overwritten in high-pressure beats—figurative density slows momentum (e.g., “kaleidoscope of possibility,” “intricate web of causality”). Repetitive phrasing (“poised... poised”) and near-paraphrase loops dilute propulsion. Final lines restate earlier ideas without deepening, dulling the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“thistled calm,” “narrative vortex”) with stacked modifiers that blur clarity. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“dust motes dancing… dust motes continued to dance”). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; however, the phrase “teach dust to tell stories” borders on pseudo-profundity without grounding mechanics. Final lines are strong, but mid-text has slight scaffold in repetitive atmospheric cues.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwriting plagues key moments: “weaves truth carefully into the fabric of the portrait,” “somber marvel,” “poignant reminder”—abstractions masquerading as insight. Paraphrase loops occur (“fragility… ephemeral nature… transience of art and life”). The closure beat suffers from stacked modifiers (“delicate touch… essence… gentle currents”) that blur agency. Figurative density exceeds propulsion; sentences often tell mood instead of advancing tension or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is overwritten: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“agonize over contradictions… mind racing… struggled to make sense”), creating loop artifacts. Figurative density is high but often redundant (“maelstrom,” “tangled web,” “intricate mechanisms”). Register drift appears in peak beats (“sedimentary layers of the city’s ruins” reads like textbook geology). Final paragraph repeats earlier motifs without propulsion, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in high-pressure beats—figurative density dilutes propulsion (e.g., “braided voices,” “traveled stillness,” “resonate as a beacon”). Minor paraphrase loops occur (“sense of… sense of…”), and elevated diction (“poignant reminder,” “enduring legacy”) occasionally clashes with immediacy. Final third suffers from summary over dramatization, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is often evocative but suffers from figurative density in high-pressure beats—e.g., “symphony of tastes,” “fabric of time rewoven”—approaching purple prose. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“gentle rebellion” repeated without deepening). Sentence openings vary, but cadence leans on rhythmic parallelism (“a celebration… a beacon…”). Final image is strong, yet some lines tell (“her craft was not just about cooking but about healing”) rather than embody transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sentence variety and sensory specificity are strong early on, but mid-story lapses into summary (“began to inspect… searching for clues”) drain momentum. The phrase “intricate mechanisms of the beehive” repeats conceptual redundancy without new pressure. Final paragraph overuses lyrical abstraction (“city’s heartbeat,” “lullaby to the city’s slumber”) that dilutes closure’s concrete impact. No severe artifacts, but elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” implied) occasionally clashes with observational POV.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but over-ornamented in high-pressure beats: “hushed blaze,” “fabric of reality subtly rearranged” blur concrete causality. Minor paraphrase loops (“alive… living, breathing entity”) and stacked modifiers dilute propulsion. Sentence variety is strong, yet figurative density occasionally obscures action—e.g., ritual described through abstraction rather than specific gestures. Final paragraph suffers slight summarization instead of crystalline image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence-level craft shows high information density early, but the second half suffers from paraphrase loops: “thriving, vibrant ecosystem” appears twice; “thread together fragments” repeats with minimal variation. Figurative language is lush but occasionally excessive (“ballerinas,” “ethereal light,” “cascading revelations”) without pattern-teaching payoff. Final paragraph contains redundant assertions of the statue’s role, dulling propulsion. No syntactic monotony, but scaffold sentences (“The statue realized…”) accumulate in reflective blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive figurative density: “endless steps,” “never-ending labyrinth,” “infinite staircase” loop without progression. Mixed metaphors (“stairs like a serpent,” “rabbit hole of speculation”) blur physical logic. Final paragraph restates motifs without propulsion, dulling closure impact with paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwritten: metaphors like “kaleidoscope of faces” and “sea of color and sound” verge on abstraction. There’s mild synonym churn (“recede,” “melt away,” “seep back in”) and repetitive cadence in reflective passages. However, rhythm generally supports mood, and key images land with clarity. The final paragraph tightens effectively, though “flame of hope” risks cliché. No fatal artifacts, but density occasionally slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is often lush but occasionally overwrought (“ethereal light,” “monumental waterfall,” “exquisite opera glass”), risking purple prose in high-pressure beats. Repetitive constructions appear: “Elena’s eyes… sparkled,” “Elena’s motivation… was clear,” “Elena’s thoughts turned”—a template cadence that dulls immediacy. The phrase “stories that lay just beneath the surface” repeats verbatim, creating a paraphrase loop. Information density is moderate, but some sentences summarize rather than propel.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overwriting plagues key beats: stacked modifiers (“crumbling walls,” “musty bowels,” “otherworldly light”) and repetitive phrasing (“mysterious lighthouse” x3, “latent radiance” x4) create synonym churn. Paraphrase loops abound (“uncover secrets… unravel mysteries… unlock secrets”). Final paragraph’s “vast expanse of possibility” is generic, and figurative density obscures causality in the climax. Sentence variety falters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive syntactic structures (“The whispering advisor’s voice…” opens four sentences) and paraphrase loops (“lingering luminance” repeated without progression). Overuse of filter verbs (“I felt,” “I spotted,” “I recalled”) dulls immediacy, especially in high-pressure beats. Figurative language is dense but often contradictory (“repulsive allure,” “siren’s call” mixed with “coal-black eyes”) without payoff. The final paragraph restates opening imagery without transformation, creating scaffold redundancy that drains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought: “a euphoric mixture of the natural and the crafted” borders on purple. Repetition weakens momentum—“the orchard afloat on its circle of driftwood” appears verbatim twice; “faintest echo/whisper” duplicates sonic motif. Several sentences restate atmospheric effects (“haunting,” “resonant,” “euphonic”) without advancing pressure. Yet rhythm varies effectively, and key images land with precision. The main flaw: paraphrase loops in the final third dull closure’s impact, preventing higher density.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“watchers on the horizon” x3, “sunwashed” x2, “weight” x3) and paraphrase loops (“driven by... and a growing sense of unease” echoes earlier lines). Figurative language is consistent but overused in high-pressure beats without payoff (“haunting, sunwashed dread”). Final paragraph’s cadence flattens momentum with redundant assertions of determination rather than sharp, propulsive imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative density: “ivy crawled like skeletal fingers,” “truth swallowed whole,” “ghostly figure in darkness” create a stacked, near-purple effect. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“peel away layers… reconstruct events… recapture truth”). Final paragraph suffers from thematic echo (“victory against deception”) and scaffolded closure (“stepped out… walked away… carried truth”). Momentum stalls in reflective blocks lacking present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences paraphrase (“documenting the remnants… wrest the stories from the silence”), and figurative density borders on purple (“darkness swallowed the surveyor whole”). Template cadence appears in repetitive constructions (“The surveyor’s…”, “The stillness…”, “The air…”). Final paragraph suffers from stacked abstractions (“beacon in the void, a light that would guide others”) that dull closure impact. Still, rhythm and imagery carry momentum despite scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is polished but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing: “reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve,” and “tranquilly perceptive” recur as labels rather than evolving states. Adjacent sentences often paraphrase (“Elara felt… Elara realized… Elara knew…”), creating momentum drag. Figurative density is high but lacks propulsion—each description accumulates atmosphere without advancing causality. The final paragraph loops through summary (“transformative,” “lessons,” “carry with her”) instead of crystallizing closure through fresh image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but over-ornamented: adjacent sentences often restate emotional states (“solace and torment,” “luminous torment that drove him to create, to shape, and to mold”). Figurative density is high without pattern payoff—lanterns, cranes, basilica, shadow appear repeatedly but without escalating pressure. Final paragraph suffers from paraphrase loops (“shaping, molding, and transforming”; “gentle, soothing rhythms”), dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetitive phrasing (“intangibly tangible,” “bleak exhilaration”) recurs without variation, creating synonym loops. Figurative density spikes unnaturally in high-pressure beats (“spirit now tempered, like the geode crystal”) while action compresses key turns into summary (“their analysis led them to a shocking revelation”). Final paragraph suffers scaffold sentences (“The hunt would continue… she was ready… heart bearing scars… spirit tempered”). Mixed metaphors (“tempered like crystal”) violate physical logic—crystals aren’t tempered like metal.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is often lush but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“brilliant dimness” appears twice; “stars twinkling like diamonds” then “twinkling like a celestial map”) and stacked modifiers that blur momentum. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (e.g., Lena feeling connection, then belonging, then truth). Figurative density peaks in low-pressure beats, dulling impact. Final paragraph loops sentimentally without advancing closure, though rhythm and sentence variety generally support mood.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    Overwriting mars key beats: “sieved hush,” “tempered regret,” “lunar glow” stack modifiers without advancing causality. Repetitive phrasing (“secrets that lay hidden,” “weight of…”) creates paraphrase loops. Figurative density is high but static—metaphors decorate rather than propel. Final paragraph’s “whisper of her presence” feels ornamental, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished but occasionally overwritten: metaphors like “mist swirling around her like a living entity” and “furrowed hush” verge on purple. Minor paraphrase loops appear (“delicate balance she sought to achieve” echoed later). Sentence openings vary adequately, and rhythm supports mood, but figurative density sometimes blurs immediacy. No scaffold or template cadence, though “uncommonly thoughtful” and “recycle their mistakes into wisdom” lean on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops (“lost… adrift and without direction”; “realign… gravitate… align”) and stock metaphors (“flickering flame of faith,” “path forward”). Sentences often restate emotional states rather than advance pressure (“He knew he still had regrets… but felt like he was moving in the right direction”). Figurative density is high but unpatterned—compass, poles, flame, sea all recur without syntactic or imagistic discipline. Final paragraph contains scaffold-heavy summary that tells rather than shows earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is lush but overwrought: adjacent sentences often restate mood (“jaded wonder,” “cynicism and awe,” “familiar and strange”) without advancing pressure. Figurative density peaks in high-description beats (“water’s glow pulsing with otherworldly energy”) without pattern-teaching, risking purple prose. Paragraphs vary visually, but propulsion stalls during atmospheric summaries. No glaring errors, but scaffold phrasing (“felt… began to sense… felt herself becoming”) dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“calm and peaceful existence” followed by “paradoxically steady”; “cosmic intimacy” then “kaleidoscope of colors”). Figurative density peaks during the ritual without pattern-teaching payoff, creating slight muddle. Sentence openings vary adequately, but filter verbs (“Lyra felt,” “Lyra noticed”) cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation and sensory precision. However, figurative density occasionally tips into overwriting (“choking beauty that clung to every breath,” “threads in a tapestry”), and adjacent lines sometimes paraphrase (“fractures in her own understanding” / “fractures in time itself”). No fatal loops or scaffold, but minor redundancy in the final third slightly dulls propulsion. Closure image remains clear despite ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sentence-level craft shows rhythmic control and varied syntax, but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“faint shimmer of long-dried tears” appears three times) and figurative stacking in climactic beats (“spirit buoyed,” “heart swelled,” “stars twinkled in anticipation”). Minor scaffold loops exist—e.g., restating the Tear’s properties—and the closure beat leans on abstract summary over concrete image, dulling propulsion at peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“the world had been transformed… the world was alive and pulsing”), and figurative density dilutes clarity (“slow dance of celestial bodies” appears three times with diminishing returns). Template cadence emerges in climactic paragraphs (“Aria felt… Aria knew… Aria would…”). The final third suffers from paraphrase loops and elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration” implied but not earned), dulling emotional propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is often overwritten: adjacent sentences restate ideas (“darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun” echoes repeatedly). Figurative density overwhelms causality—e.g., “whispers of a silent revolution” appears three times with diminishing returns. Template cadence emerges in climax (“The vigilant lock sentinel remained steadfast… as the silent revolution continued…”). Closure beat suffers from paraphrase loops (“glow,” “light,” “illuminate” redundantly deployed), dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is polished but over-ornamented: adjacent lines repeat concepts (“sacred patterns that governed the universe” / “hidden patterns that governed the universe”). Figurative density occasionally blurs causality (“fabric of reality would begin to unravel” vs. later “bend”). Final paragraph’s “testament to the power” verges on summary. Sentence variety and sensory detail are strong, yet scaffold phrases (“with reverent hands,” “deliberate slowness”) dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is lush but overwrought in high-pressure beats: “maddening vortex of sound and sense,” “storm-kissed wonder,” “tempest was washing away the detritus”—figurative density blurs clarity. Paraphrase loops occur (“hidden patterns… unseen lines… cartography of scars”) and template cadence appears in storm descriptions. The final paragraph suffers register drift into near-moralizing (“lessons of this night,” “map etched into her soul”). These artifacts dull the closure image despite strong rhythmic control elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is polished but overwritten in key moments: “dignified chaos that was both beautiful and intense” exemplifies stacked modifiers blurring sense. Repetitive phrasing (“the danish tin sewing needle card… seemed to…”) creates paraphrase loops. Figurative density peaks during the duel without pattern payoff—“clashing steel,” “scent of metal and sweat” feel generic. Final paragraph’s cadence is strong, but mid-story momentum drags under descriptive weight that doesn’t advance pressure or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is fluent but over-relies on figurative density without variation in pressure: metaphors accumulate (“treasure trove of scraps,” “fracture in the darkness,” “luminous fracture”) without grounding in action. Paraphrase loops appear (“rebuild the library… help rebuild the city”; “sense of purpose… newfound sense of purpose”). Final paragraphs summarize transformation rather than dramatizing incremental change.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense with figurative language, often doing double duty in atmosphere and emotion. However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: “vortex of sound,” “shadowy figures and forgotten landscapes,” “horizon invites night” verge on purple prose. Minor paraphrase loops exist (“flickering compasses… guiding her… compasses continued to flicker”). Final paragraph repeats “mist-shrouded arbor” and “hidden sections,” creating a slight echo that dulls closure impact. Still, rhythm and imagery largely serve the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is polished but over-reliant on figurative language in high-pressure beats (“memories washed away like grains of sand,” “tentative fingers,” “tapestry of vibrant colors”). Several adjacent sentences restate ideas (e.g., memory as “fragile entity” then “living, breathing thing”) without added pressure—paraphrase loops dull momentum. Final paragraph uses templated cadence (“The... had done..., and the... was safe”) that softens closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (“rhythmically placid atmosphere” appears verbatim twice; “tides of remembrance” three times) and paraphrase loops (e.g., “calm his mind” / “sense of peace settle over him”). Figurative density is high but often static—“cerulean regret” is named, not dramatized. Sentence openings vary moderately, but template cadence emerges in action sequences (“He walked… He breathed… He picked…”). Closure beat is dulled by summary (“felt the weight… lift”) rather than concrete image.
